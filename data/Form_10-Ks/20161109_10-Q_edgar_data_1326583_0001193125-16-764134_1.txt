     FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains both historical and forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical
fact are, or may be, forward-looking statements. For example, statements concerning projections, predictions, expectations, estimates or forecasts and statements that describe our objectives, future performance, plans or goals are, or may be,
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect management s current expectations concerning future results and events and can generally be identified by the use of expressions such as  may,   will, 
 should,   could,   would,   likely,   predict,   potential,   continue,   future,   estimate,   believe,   expect, 
 anticipate,   intend,   plan,   foresee,  and other similar words or phrases, as well as statements in the future tense.  
 Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or
achievements to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. The following important risks and uncertainties could affect our future results, causing those results to differ materially
from those expressed in our forward-looking statements:      

failure to achieve sufficient levels of usage of the Websites and mobile applications in  The WebMD Health Network  or of our  WebMD Health Services  platform and related services;    

the inability to successfully deploy new or updated applications or services for  The WebMD Health Network  and our  WebMD Health Services  platform or, if deployed, the failure to create new or enhanced
revenue streams from those applications or services;        

failure to attract sufficient consumers and healthcare professionals to our Websites and mobile applications, including as a result of existing and new competitors for those audiences;    

competition for advertisers and sponsors for our Websites and mobile applications and for employer and health insurer clients of our  WebMD Health Services  platform;    

reductions in promotional and educational spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, whether resulting from the number and timing of regulatory approvals of new products or indications, from the number and
timing of regulatory approvals of generic products that compete with existing brand name products or from other factors affecting the relevant markets;        

failure to preserve and enhance the  WebMD  and  Medscape  brands and our other brands;        

the inability to provide health coaching and condition management services that meet the needs of clients and potential clients of our  WebMD Health Services  platform or the failure to do so with sufficient
efficiency to make those services profitable for us;        

the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel;        

adverse economic conditions and disruptions in the capital markets;        

adverse changes in general business or regulatory conditions affecting the healthcare, information technology and Internet industries; and    

the Risk Factors described in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.    
 These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in
any of our forward-looking statements. Other factors, including unknown or unpredictable ones, also could have material adverse effects on our future results. The information in this Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission since that filing.  
 The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except as
required by law or regulation, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

  1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
  Background     WebMD Health Corp. (the
 Company  or  WebMD ) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on May 3, 2005. The Company completed an initial public offering on September 28, 2005. The Company s Common Stock trades under the symbol
 WBMD  on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Company generates revenue from the advertising and sponsorship services of  The WebMD Health Network  and related operations, from the services it markets to employers and health plans
under the  WebMD Health Services  brand and from certain information services, each of which is described below and discussed further under  Presentation of Segment Information  in this Note 1.  
  Advertising and Sponsorship .  The WebMD Health Network  includes:  www.WebMD.com , the Company s primary public portal
for consumers and related mobile-optimized sites and mobile apps;  www.Medscape.com , the Company s primary public portal for physicians and other healthcare professionals and related mobile services; and other sites and apps through which
the Company provides branded health and wellness content, tools and services. The Company s services for consumers enable them to obtain information on health and wellness topics or on a particular disease or condition, to assess their personal
health status, to use online trackers, tools and quizzes, to locate physicians, to receive periodic e-mailed newsletters and alerts on topics of individual interest, and to participate in online communities with peers and experts. The Company s
services for physicians and healthcare professionals make it easier for them to access clinical reference sources, stay abreast of the latest clinical information, learn about new treatment options, earn continuing medical education credit and
communicate with peers. The Company does not charge any usage, membership or download fees for access to its public portals or mobile platforms. The Company generates revenue from its public portals and mobile platforms primarily through the sale of
various types of advertising and sponsorship programs to its clients, which include: pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies; hospitals, clinics and other healthcare services companies; health insurance providers; consumer
products companies whose products or services relate to health, wellness, diet, fitness, lifestyle, safety and illness prevention; and various other businesses, organizations and governmental entities. Advertisers and sponsors use the Company s
services to reach, educate and inform target audiences of consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals. The Company also generates revenue from advertising sold in  WebMD Magazine , a consumer magazine distributed to physician
office waiting rooms.     Health Services . The Company markets services under the  WebMD Health Services  brand that help
employers and health plans improve the health of their employee and plan participant populations and, as a result, manage their healthcare costs. The Company hosts its  WebMD Health Services  platform for private and public sector employers and
health plans and its cloud-based online services can be accessed by their employees and plan participants using a computer, a tablet or a smartphone. The  WebMD Health Services  platform provides an online personal health record application and
personal health content, tools and other resources relevant to the specific individual s eligibility, coverage and wellness profile, including decision-support applications that help users make informed decisions about health risks, lifestyle
choices, healthcare providers, treatment options, and healthcare benefits options. The Company s flexible architecture allows it to integrate with the client s existing programs, Websites and intranets for their employees and plan
participants. The Company also offers clients the ability to design team-based and individual wellness challenges that help foster a culture of wellness in the workplace. In addition, the Company offers telephonic, online and onsite health coaching
and targeted condition management programs that help employees and plan participants make healthier lifestyle choices to achieve their health and wellness goals. The Company generates revenue from subscriptions to its  WebMD Health Services 
platform by employers and health plans, either directly or through its distributors. WebMD offers its health coaching services and its condition management programs on a per-participant basis.

   Information Services.  The Company also generates revenue from the sale of certain
information products and services on a stand-alone basis using de-identified data that it licenses from a small number of third party data sources, of which the principal source is a license retained by HLTH Corporation ( HLTH ), the
Company s former parent company, in connection with the sale of its Emdeon Business Services ( EBS ) business. As the successor to HLTH, the Company received this license which provides the Company the rights to certain de-identified
data from the operation of the EBS business (which is now known as Change Healthcare) through early February 2018 for use in the development and commercialization of various information products and services. Customers include data services,
informatics and consulting companies.     Interim Financial Statements   
 The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared by management and reflect all adjustments (consisting of only
normal recurring adjustments) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results to be expected for any subsequent period or for the entire year ending December 31, 2016. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted under the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and regulations.  
 The unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes included herein should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited
consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
  Seasonality     The timing of the
Company s revenue is affected by seasonal factors. The Company s public portal advertising and sponsorship revenue is seasonal, primarily due to the annual spending patterns of the advertising and sponsorship clients of the Company s
public portals. This portion of the Company s revenue is usually the lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year, and generally increases during each consecutive quarter throughout the year. The timing of revenue in relation to the
Company s expenses, many of which do not vary directly with revenue, has an impact on cost of operations, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter.  
  Accounting Estimates     The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience, current business factors, and various other assumptions that the Company believes are necessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the recorded amounts of revenue and
expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The Company is subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic and political factors, and changes in the Company s business environment; therefore, actual results
could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company s financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as
the Company s operating environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results

of operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates and assumptions by management affect the
allowance for doubtful accounts, the carrying value of long-lived assets (including goodwill and intangible assets), the amortization period of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), the carrying value,
capitalization and amortization of software and Website development costs, the carrying value of investments, the provision for income taxes and related deferred tax accounts, certain accrued liabilities, revenue recognition, contingencies,
litigation and related legal accruals and the value attributed to employee stock options and other stock-based awards.     Presentation of Segment
Information     The Company generates revenue in four groups, as set forth in the table below. The first group is  Advertising and
Sponsorship   Biopharma and Medical Device  and consists of advertising and sponsorship revenue from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device clients relating to ethical pharmaceutical products or other regulated devices or
products or for sponsoring educational programs. The second category is  Advertising and Sponsorship   OTC, CPG and Other  and consists of advertising and sponsorship revenue relating to non-Rx or over-the-counter medications and
other healthcare products, food and beverages, beauty products and other consumer products, as well as revenue from clients such as retailers, pharmacies, hospitals, health insurance companies and government agencies. The combined revenue of the
first two groups is sometimes referred to as  Advertising and Sponsorship  revenue. The third group is  Health Services  (which the Company previously referred to as  Private Portal Services ) and consists of revenue
from employers and health plans for subscriptions to the Company s  WebMD Health Services  platform and for related services, including health coaching and condition management services. The change in the name of this group to  Health
Services  began in the Company s reporting on the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and did not reflect any change in the source of the revenue included in this group from prior periods. The fourth group is  Information Services 
and consists of revenue from the sale of stand-alone information and data products. Discrete financial information related to a measure of profit or loss for these four revenue groups is not available as they leverage many common expenses, and the
Company does not separately allocate these common expenses in assessing the performance of its business. Accordingly, the Company views its business as one reportable segment.  
 The following table presents the revenues recognized from the four revenue groups described above during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015:

   Net Income Per Common Share   
 Basic income per common share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the periods
presented. Diluted income per common share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the periods, increased to give effect to potentially dilutive securities and assumes that any dilutive
convertible notes were converted, only in the periods in which such effect is dilutive (shares in thousands):      
   The Company has excluded certain of its convertible notes, as well as certain outstanding stock options and
restricted stock, from the calculation of diluted income per common share during the periods in which such securities were anti-dilutive. The following table presents the total weighted-average number of potentially dilutive common shares that were
excluded from the computation of diluted income per common share during the periods presented (shares in thousands):

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During 2016    
 In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-12,  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the
Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period , which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a
performance condition. The revised guidance was effective for the Company beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of the revised guidance did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements as it
does not have any share-based awards with performance targets currently outstanding.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,
 Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The revised guidance was effective for the Company, on a retrospective basis, beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of the revised
guidance only affected the balance sheet classification of its debt issuance costs. The impact of this reclassification on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was a decrease to other assets of $9,612, a decrease to the
carrying amount of the 2.25% Convertible Notes due 2016 (the  2.25% Notes ) of $159, a decrease to the carrying amount of the 2.50% Convertible Notes due 2018 (the  2.50% Notes ) of $3,719 and a decrease to the carrying amount of
the 1.50% Convertible Notes due 2020 (the  1.50% Notes ) of $5,734 (see table below).    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2015-05,  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement , which provides guidance in determining whether a cloud
computing arrangement includes a software license. If it is determined that a cloud computing arrangement does include a software license, the software element should be accounted for consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If
the arrangement does not include a software license, it should be accounted for as a service contract. The revised guidance was effective for the Company beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and will be applied prospectively to all
arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for
Measurement-Period Adjustments , which requires that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, rather than
retrospectively adjusting previously reported amounts. The revised guidance was effective for the Company, on a prospective basis, beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the
Company s consolidated financial statements.    In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet instead of separating deferred
taxes into current and noncurrent. The revised guidance was required to be effective for the Company beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2017 and could be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or
retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption was permitted and the Company elected to early adopt the guidance in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of the revised guidance only affected the
balance sheet classification of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the related valuation allowance. The impact of this reclassification on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was a decrease to current deferred tax
assets of $16,126, an increase to noncurrent deferred tax assets of $15,694 and a decrease to other long-term liabilities of $432 (see table below).

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   
   
  The following table summarizes the reclassifications made to the consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 2015 in connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-17:      
     Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted in the Future    
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , to achieve a consistent
application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under GAAP. Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the revised guidance requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which delays the effective date of ASU
No. 2014-09 by one year. As a result, the revised guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of the guidance. The revised
guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. In March, April and May 2016, the FASB

accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. At the Company s option, and to the extent permitted by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market (or the applicable rules of such other exchange on which the
Company s Common Stock may be listed), instead of paying the repurchase price in cash, the Company may pay the repurchase price in shares of its Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of its Common Stock. However, in the case of
certain change of control transactions in which the Company is acquired by a public company, the Company may elect to provide for conversion of the 2.50% Notes into acquirer common stock, in which case the repurchase option would not apply.

   3.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, the Company uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
These inputs are prioritized below:      

Level 1:   
    
 Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
 
    Level 2:   
    
 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.  
 
    Level 3:   
    
 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions.  
    Cash and Marketable Securities   
 The following table sets forth the Company s Level 1 financial assets that were measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      
   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company invested $948,078 in U.S. Treasury securities
which have a maturity date of December 22, 2016. These securities are reflected within Investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.  
 The Company s equity security consists of an equity investment in a publicly traded company that completed its initial public offering in
December 2014. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a gain on investments of $139, which represents the proceeds received by the Company when it sold a portion of this security. The unrealized gain related to
this investment, net of tax, is included within accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
  Foreign Currency Forward Contracts     The
Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies related to contracts with certain of the Company s customers that are denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British Pound and the Euro. In order to manage this risk, the
Company has hedged portions of its foreign currency denominated customer contracts with foreign currency forward contracts. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts with U.S. dollar
equivalent notional amounts of $8,757 and $0, respectively, all of which were designated as and qualified as cash flow hedges. These forward contracts are intended to fix the amount of these foreign currency obligations in terms of the
Company s functional currency, the U.S. dollar. All of the Company s derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and the Company does not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.  
      15

WEBMD HEALTH CORP.   
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   
   
  The Company recognizes the fair value of its foreign currency forward contracts as either
assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments are recorded each period in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as unrealized gains and losses until the forecasted underlying
transaction occurs. Realized gains and losses for the effective portion of such contracts are recognized in cost of operations in the consolidated statement of operations in the period when the forecasted underlying transaction occurs. The Company
classifies the cash flows from hedging instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items.    The Company assesses,
both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the foreign currency forward contracts used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the hedged items. The Company also assesses hedge ineffectiveness
quarterly and, if determined to be ineffective, records the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion in its consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses related to hedge ineffectiveness were not material during the periods
presented.    The following table sets forth the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts, which are valued using Level 2 inputs,
and the balance sheet lines in which they are recorded:      
   The impact on accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) and net income from foreign currency
forward contracts, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      
    Other   
 For disclosure purposes, the Company is required to measure the outstanding value of its debt on a recurring basis. The following table
presents the principal amount and estimated fair value (based on Level 1 market price data) of the Company s convertible notes as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  
   
   The Company also holds an investment in a privately held company which is carried at cost, and not subject to
fair value measurements. However, if events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, it would be reviewed for impairment. The total amount of the Company s investment in this

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)   

privately held company was $5,278 and $6,471 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to
partial cash redemptions of this investment of $526 and $667 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Since the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over this company, the investment is accounted for under the cost method and it is included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
  4.    Equity      Stock Repurchase
Program     In August 2011, the Board of Directors established a stock repurchase program (the  Program ) through which the
Company was authorized to use up to $75,000 to purchase shares of WebMD Common Stock, from time to time, in the open market through block trades or in private transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors. In October
2011, February 2014, March 2014, April 2014, November 2014 and September 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized increases to the Program of $75,000, $50,000, $40,000, $30,000, $23,895 and $27,451, respectively.
Additionally, on September 16, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized an increase to the Program of $35,198, bringing the total then available under the Program to $50,000. During both the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 432,072 of its Common Stock shares at an aggregate cost of $22,447 under the Program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company repurchased 557,776 shares and 688,467
shares, respectively, at an aggregate cost of $23,055 and $28,406, respectively, under the Program. As of September 30, 2016, $46,807 remained available for repurchases under the Program.

    6.    Commitments and Contingencies   
  Legal Proceedings       Dual Diagnosis
Treatment Center, et al. v. Blue Cross of California, et al.      On May 8, 2015, six providers of substance abuse and/or mental
health treatment services located in the States of California, Arizona and Florida filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the  Action ) initially against twenty-eight (28) Blue
Cross and Blue Shield companies (collectively  Blue Cross ), as well as at least forty-one (41) health and benefit plans, including the WebMD Health and Welfare Plan (the  Health Plan ). Additional defendants have since been
added. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, one of the Blue Cross companies named as a defendant, serves as third-party claims administrator for the Health Plan, a welfare plan sponsored by the Company under the applicable provisions of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ). The Company self-insures (up to the deductible amount under the Company s stop loss insurance policy) the group health plan component of the Health Plan. The
Company serves as  plan administrator  for the Health Plan under ERISA. The plaintiffs,  out-of-network  providers to Blue Cross, claim that Blue Cross improperly ignored assignments of benefits received by the plaintiffs from
the individual plan participants and sent payments directly to such individual participants who then failed to remit those payments to the providers. Plaintiffs claim that defendants  failures to honor the assignments violate ERISA and state
law and they seek recovery for benefit claims in unspecified amounts that they claim have been paid to the wrong party together with attorney fees, as well as removal of all fiduciaries who are found to have breached ERISA-imposed duties under the
relevant health and benefit plans on account of such conduct, and injunctive relief to enjoin Blue Cross from alleged unlawful practices regarding assignments of benefits. The Company has not yet

filed an answer to the complaint. On September 14, 2015, most of the named defendants, including the Company, filed an omnibus motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.
Thereafter, the plaintiffs amended the complaint and added new parties. Defendants received an extension of time to respond to the amended complaint and on January 25, 2016, 184 defendants, including the Company, renewed the omnibus motion to
dismiss after all new parties were served and appeared in the Action. Opposition papers were filed on the motion on March 21, 2016, and reply papers were filed by the moving defendants on April 4, 2016. Oral argument on the motion was held
on May 31, 2016, after which the parties filed additional submissions at the Court s direction. The motion is currently pending. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this action or to reasonably estimate the possible loss or
range of loss, if any, arising from the claims asserted therein.      Other Legal Proceedings    
 In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various claims and legal proceedings. While the ultimate
resolution of these matters has yet to be determined, the Company does not believe that their outcomes will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  
  7.    Stock-Based Compensation   
 The Company has various stock-based compensation plans (collectively, the  Plans ) that provide for the grant of stock options,
restricted stock, and other awards based on WebMD Common Stock.    The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended, the  2005 Plan )
is the only existing plan under which future grants can be made. The maximum number of shares of the Company s Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the 2005 Plan was 24,975,000 as of September 30, 2016, subject to adjustment in
accordance with the terms of the 2005 Plan. The Company had an aggregate of 2,633,642 shares of Common Stock available for future grants under the 2005 Plan at September 30, 2016, of which 1,501,500 shares are available for grant only to
individuals who are not executive officers of the Company (other than in the case of a new hire who joins the Company as an executive officer) or members of the Company s Board of Directors.  
  Stock Options     Generally,
options under the Plans vest and become exercisable ratably over periods ranging from three to four years based on their individual grant dates, subject to continued employment on the applicable vesting dates, and generally expire within ten years
from the date of grant. Options are granted at prices not less than the fair market value of the Company s Common Stock on the date of grant. The following table summarizes stock option activity for the Plans:  

(a) 
 The aggregate intrinsic value is based on the market price of the Company s Common Stock on September 30, 2016, which was $49.70, less the applicable exercise price of the underlying option. This aggregate
intrinsic value represents the amount that would have been realized if all the option holders had exercised their options on September 30, 2016.

  The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model considering the weighted-average assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options of the Company s Common Stock combined with historical
volatility of the Company s Common Stock. The expected term represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding following their grant date, and was determined using historical exercise data combined with assumptions for
future exercise activity. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the options on the grant date.      
    Restricted Stock   
 The Company s Restricted Stock consists of shares of the Company s Common Stock which have been awarded to employees with
restrictions that cause them to be subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and restrict their sale or other transfer by the employee until they vest. Generally, the Company s Restricted Stock grants vest ratably over periods ranging from
three to four years from their individual award dates subject to continued employment on the applicable vesting dates. The following table summarizes the activity of the Company s Restricted Stock:  
   
   Proceeds received from the exercise of options to purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock were
$3,290 and $52,702 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $3,532 and $15,185 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Additionally, in connection with the exercise of
certain stock options and the vesting of restricted stock, the Company made payments of $3,895 and $7,705 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $876 and $3,836 during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, respectively, related to employee statutory withholding taxes that were satisfied by withholding shares of Common Stock of equal value from the respective employees. The proceeds and payments described above are reflected
within cash flows from financing activities within the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.    The intrinsic value related to
stock options that were exercised, combined with the fair value of shares of restricted stock that vested, aggregated $14,245 and $53,539 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $5,641 and $24,423 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

   Our Company.      WebMD Health Corp. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on May 3, 2005. We
completed an initial public offering on September 28, 2005. Our Common Stock trades under the symbol  WBMD  on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.  
   Our Business.      We generate revenue from the advertising and sponsorship services of  The WebMD Health
Network  and related operations, from the services we market to employers and health plans under the  WebMD Health Services  brand and from certain information services, each of which is described below and discussed further under
 Supplemental Financial and Operating Information  below.     Advertising and Sponsorship.    The WebMD
Health Network  includes:  www.WebMD.com , our primary public portal for consumers and related mobile-optimized sites and mobile apps;  www.Medscape.com , our primary public portal for physicians and other healthcare professionals and
related mobile services; and other  
      22  

Table of Contents  

sites and apps through which we provide our branded health and wellness content, tools and services. Our services for consumers enable them to obtain information on health and wellness topics or
on a particular disease or condition, to assess their personal health status, to use online trackers, tools and quizzes, to locate physicians, to receive periodic e-mailed newsletters and alerts on topics of individual interest, and to participate
in online communities with peers and experts. Our services for physicians and healthcare professionals make it easier for them to access clinical reference sources, stay abreast of the latest clinical information, learn about new treatment options,
earn continuing medical education (which we refer to as CME) credit and communicate with peers. We do not charge any usage, membership or download fees for access to our public portals or mobile platforms. We generate revenue from our public portals
and mobile platforms primarily through the sale of various types of advertising and sponsorship programs to our clients, which include: pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies; hospitals, clinics and other healthcare services
companies; health insurance providers; consumer products companies whose products or services relate to health, wellness, diet, fitness, lifestyle, safety and illness prevention; and various other businesses, organizations and governmental entities.
Advertisers and sponsors use our services to reach, educate and inform target audiences of consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals. We also generate revenue from advertising sold in  WebMD Magazine , a consumer magazine
distributed to physician office waiting rooms.     Health Services.     We market services under the  WebMD
Health Services  brand that help employers and health plans improve the health of their employee and plan participant populations and, as a result, manage their healthcare costs. We host our  WebMD Health Services  platform for private and
public sector employers and health plans and our cloud-based online services can be accessed by their employees and plan participants using a computer, a tablet or a smartphone. The  WebMD Health Services  platform provides an online personal
health record application and personalized content, tools and other resources relevant to the specific individual s eligibility, coverage and wellness profile, including decision-support applications that help users make informed decisions
about health risks, lifestyle choices, healthcare providers, treatment options, and healthcare benefits options. Our flexible architecture allows us to integrate with the client s existing programs, Websites and intranets for their employees
and plan participants. We also offer clients the ability to design team-based and individual wellness challenges that help foster a culture of wellness in the workplace. In addition, we offer telephonic, online and onsite health coaching and
targeted condition management programs that help employees and plan participants make healthier lifestyle choices to achieve their health and wellness goals. We generate revenue from subscriptions to our  WebMD Health Services  platform by
employers and health plans, either directly or through distributors. In addition, we offer our health coaching services and our condition management programs on a per participant basis.  
  Information Services.     We generate revenue from the sale of certain information products and services on a
stand-alone basis using de-identified data that we license from a small number of third party data sources, of which the principal source is a license retained by HLTH Corporation (or HLTH), our former parent company, in connection with the sale of
its Emdeon Business Services (or EBS) business. As the successor to HLTH, we received this license which provides us the rights to certain de-identified data from the operation of the EBS business (now known as Change Healthcare) through early
February 2018 for use in the development and commercialization of various information products and services. Customers include data services, informatics and consulting companies. We do not expect that the current license agreement with Change
Healthcare will continue after February 2018, and expect that if such agreement is renewed or is replaced with new third party data sources, the terms of any such renewal or replacement license would not be as favorable to us as those in the current
agreement. Change Healthcare is in the process of merging with McKesson Corporation and, as a result, discussions around extending our agreement with Change Healthcare have stalled. We are exploring other sources of third-party data and uses of our
first party data to generate additional revenue streams, but we are early in that process. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that the sales of, or the profits generated by, our stand-alone information products would not be materially
adversely affected by the expiration, in early February 2018, of our license agreement with Change Healthcare. This will not impact our 2016 or 2017 revenue or earnings, but would have an impact in 2018.

    Background Information on Certain Trends and Developments Affecting Our
Business.   Key trends and developments affecting the use of healthcare information services of the types we provide or are developing and our ability to generate revenue from those services include the following:  

Use of the Internet by Consumers and Physicians.     The Internet has emerged as a major communications medium and has fundamentally changed many sectors of the economy, including the marketing
and sales of financial services, travel, and entertainment, among others. The Internet is also changing the healthcare industry and has transformed how consumers and physicians find and utilize healthcare information.    

The Internet has fundamentally changed the way consumers obtain health and wellness information, enabling them to have immediate access to searchable information and dynamic interactive content to check symptoms,
understand diseases, find providers and evaluate treatment options. Healthcare consumers seek to educate themselves online about their healthcare-related issues, motivated by the desire to become better informed patients and to become more engaged
healthcare consumers.        

The Internet has become a primary source of information for physicians and other healthcare professionals seeking to improve clinical practice and to interact with their peers. The Internet has also become one of the
primary means for physicians to obtain CME and other healthcare professionals to obtain continuing education.        

Online Marketing and Education Spending for Healthcare Products.     Pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and
educating consumers and physicians about them; however, only a small portion is currently spent on online services. We believe that these companies, which represented approximately 74% of our advertising and sponsorship revenue in 2015, are aware of
the effectiveness of the Internet relative to traditional media in providing health, clinical and product-related information to consumers and physicians. In addition, in an effort to improve operating efficiencies, some pharmaceutical companies
have been reducing their field sales forces in the past several years. We believe that we are well-positioned to provide advertising solutions for pharmaceutical products that are currently being marketed as well as those in the pipeline for Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Many of these pharmaceutical products are expensive therapies that treat complex conditions affecting relatively small patient populations, for which we believe that our online services provide an efficient
way to reach target audiences. However, notwithstanding our general expectation for increased future demand, we cannot predict the extent or the pace of any shift by pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies of their marketing
expenditures to online services or to what extent they will choose WebMD to provide such services. In 2016, there has been increasing scrutiny regarding pricing increases for pharmaceutical products, which could lead to additional regulation of
pharmaceutical pricing or other changes in how those products are distributed and the roles played by various industry participants in that distribution. We cannot predict the effect that such scrutiny or any resulting changes may have on the
marketing plans of our customers in future periods or their future use of our services. Furthermore, our advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of other factors, many of which are outside
our control, including economic and regulatory conditions generally and those specifically affecting healthcare industry participants, as well as the following:        

The majority of our advertising and sponsorship contracts are for terms of approximately four to twelve months. We have relatively few longer term advertising and sponsorship contracts.    

The time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program
and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor for that program, as well as the additional time period before our services are delivered, may be longer than expected, especially for medium-sized and larger contracts, and may be
subject to delays over which we have little or no control, including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals, including internal approvals relating to compliance with the laws and
regulations applicable to the marketing of healthcare     
      24  

Table of Contents  

products. We have experienced, from time to time in the past, a lengthening of this internal review process by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which has resulted in delays in
contracting, as well as delays in recognizing expected revenue under executed contracts, and we cannot predict whether similar delays may occur in future periods.    
 Additional factors that may affect the timing of contracting for specific programs with advertisers and sponsors, or receipt of revenue under
such contracts, include: the timing of FDA approval for new products or for new approved uses for existing products; the timing of FDA approval of generic products that compete with existing brand name products and any increase in the number or
significance of such approvals or of withdrawals of products from the market; consolidation of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries; the timing of roll-outs of new or enhanced services on our public portals; seasonal factors
relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products; and the scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals.  

Other Factors Affecting the Demand for Our Advertising and Sponsorship Services.     Some of our pharmaceutical company customers have experienced patent expirations for certain of their
products in the past several years and some are expected to experience patent expirations over the next several years. In the pharmaceutical industry, patent expirations allow for competition from lower-priced generic versions of the patented drugs
and generally result in the termination of marketing efforts for the drug and, in certain instances, have resulted in reductions in the overall online advertising budgets for some of our customers. Our public portals advertisers and sponsors also
include companies that provide over-the-counter drugs and other healthcare products, food and beverages, beauty products and other consumer products, particularly for products and services that relate to health, wellness, diet, fitness, lifestyle,
safety and illness prevention, as well as clients such as retailers, pharmacies, hospitals, health insurance companies and government agencies. Revenues from these clients are more likely to reflect trends in general economic conditions than
revenues from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies. Accordingly, revenues from these clients may be subject to significant quarter-to-quarter variations and we may not be able to forecast those variations accurately. Our
advertising and sponsorship services are subject to competition from numerous alternatives, including other Internet sites that focus on health-related content, Internet search engines, social media Internet sites, general interest consumer sites
and traditional media. Such competition may result in smaller customer commitments or pressure to reduce prices, both of which could reduce our revenues and profit margins.    

Traffic Trends .     The WebMD Health Network  reached an average of approximately 184.1 million unique users per month in the third quarter of 2016 and delivered approximately 3.84
billion page views during the quarter, representing an 11% decrease in unique users and a 4% decrease in page views, when compared to the prior year period. Traffic to  Medscape  properties from physicians and other healthcare professionals
averaged approximately 7.7 million physician sessions per month in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of approximately 14% over the prior year period.        

Consumers and healthcare professionals are increasingly using smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices to access the Internet, with physicians increasingly using mobile devices during treatment at the point of
care. Accordingly, the portion of our page views from mobile devices has increased rapidly in the past several years as usage has increased on mobile devices. During the third quarter of 2016: approximately 41% of our page views came from a U.S.
smartphone; approximately 20% came from a U.S. personal computer (or PC); approximately 6% came from a U.S. tablet device; and approximately 33% came from non-U.S. sources. See   Efforts to Increase Advertising and Sponsorship Revenue from
Mobile  below for discussion of trends in our advertising and sponsorship revenue from mobile.        

Starting in the third quarter of 2015, we began to experience slower growth in the overall traffic to  The
WebMD Health Network  than in the prior several years and, in the third quarter of 2016, the traffic was lower than in the prior year period. We have seen declines in the number of referrals that we receive from Google and this has impacted our
overall traffic. In     
      25  

Table of Contents  

the third quarter of 2016, approximately 57% of our traffic came from search engines, as compared to approximately 69% in the prior year period. We have offset much of the decline with growth in
direct sources of traffic. In the third quarter of 2016, our non-search-related traffic increased by approximately 40% over the prior year period.        

In the third quarter of 2016, our advertising and sponsorship revenue grew 15% over the prior year period, even though the aggregate number of page views delivered by  The WebMD Health Network  declined by 4%.
Overall traffic to  The WebMD Health Network  does not have a direct correlation to our advertising and sponsorship revenue, which can continue to grow even when overall traffic is reduced. We create content on specific topics and program
various parts of  The WebMD Health Network  to build and maintain traffic in areas most important to both our audience and our advertising and sponsorship clients. For example, the total  Medscape  audience is small compared to the total
audience of  The WebMD Health Network , but  Medscape  Websites and mobile apps contributed approximately 60% of our advertising and sponsorship revenue in 2015 because of the high value our clients place on being able to reach the
 Medscape  audience of physicians and other healthcare professionals or to reach targeted portions of that  Medscape  audience. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 75% of our advertising and sponsorship revenue
was generated from less than 20% of the page views delivered by  The WebMD Health Network .        

Efforts to Increase Advertising and Sponsorship Revenue from Mobile.     We remain focused on delivering a multi-screen platform that engages users on their personal computers, tablet devices
and smartphones. As we broaden our mobile offerings for consumers and physicians, we are also expanding our mobile advertising and sponsorship products. We have been seeing increasing customer demand for mobile advertising and sponsorship and have
been including mobile components in many of the multi-platform program configurations that we are selling to advertisers and sponsors. While we offer mobile as a stand-alone purchase, our advertising and sponsorship clients are generally interested
in reaching a targeted audience, regardless of what device the user is engaging on, and choose multi-platform advertising and sponsorship programs. In 2015, our advertising and sponsorship revenue delivered on a mobile device grew to approximately
$189 million, or 38% of our total advertising and sponsorship revenue, from approximately $156 million in 2014 (which was 34% of our total advertising and sponsorship revenue in that year). This includes stand-alone mobile advertising and
sponsorship revenue as well as the allocation of multi-platform advertising and sponsorship revenue for the portion delivered on smartphone or tablet. With our significant scale in both desktop and mobile audience engagement and our ability to reach
targeted portions of our audience, we believe that  The WebMD Health Network  is well-positioned to meet the needs of our advertising and sponsorship clients.    

Social Media and Video Initiatives .    Given the increasing prominence of social networks as important platforms for finding and consuming content, WebMD is working to enable users to more
easily discover, share and interact with content from WebMD, not just on our own Websites, but also in other online locations. Some of our initiatives are directed toward the creation of new content offerings that are tailored for specific social
networks and platforms. Our strategy to extend our content and brand beyond  The WebMD Health Network  will, in some cases, allow us to drive people back to WebMD s sites, where we can monetize that traffic as we do today; in other cases,
we are exploring new monetization opportunities as we engage with users outside of WebMD s sites. Another key aspect of these initiatives is to create new video content that is both highly engaging and easily sharable across social networks. To
continue to build our video content into a scalable library, we are growing our team of video producers and editors, as well as building additional in-house expertise to create video content. We are also continuing to develop longer-form video
offerings. We believe that by taking WebMD into new online environments and onto new platforms, we will strengthen our connection to existing users, reach new audiences and diversify our traffic sources. We expect that these efforts will, over time,
allow us to create additional monetization opportunities.        

Trends Affecting Our Services for Employers and Health Plans.     In response to
increasing healthcare costs, public and private sector employers and health plans have been changing benefit plan designs to     
      26  

Table of Contents  

increase deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs and taking other steps to motivate employees and plan participants to live healthier lives and use healthcare in a cost-effective
manner. In connection with shifting greater responsibility for healthcare costs to employees and plan participants, employers and health plans are making available more health and benefits information and decision- support applications to help their
employees and plan participants make informed decisions about treatment options, health risks, lifestyle choices and healthcare providers. Since lifestyle choices, including choices regarding nutrition, exercise and tobacco use, are key drivers of
health and can dramatically impact risks for acquiring chronic, costly health conditions, employers and health plans seek to reduce demand for healthcare services by focusing on health and wellness initiatives for their employees and plan
participants. We believe that, through our  WebMD Health Services  platform and related coaching and condition management services, we are well positioned to play a role in this environment. Our services help employees and plan participants
make more informed health and benefit decisions, positively change health behaviors, manage health conditions and lead healthier lives. Our strategy depends, in part, on increasing usage of our services by our employer and health plan clients 
employees and plan participants and being able to demonstrate a sufficient return on investment and other benefits for our clients from those services. Increasing such usage requires us to continue to develop new and updated applications, features
and services.         

International.     Physicians and healthcare professionals from around the world access our content in English through  Medscape . In addition, we publish Spanish, French, Portuguese and
German language editions of  Medscape  through which healthcare professionals can access our content in those languages. We have also entered into collaborations with companies having expertise in a specific country or region to extend our
reach. We plan to continue to pursue opportunities to expand the reach of our brands outside the United States, particularly with respect to our healthcare professionals audience. In certain markets outside the United States, we expect to accomplish
this through partnerships or joint ventures with other companies having expertise in the specific country or region, while in other such markets we expect to rely primarily on our own internal resources.    

Other Initiatives .    We are pursuing, and intend to continue to identify, new business opportunities where our consumer and physician audiences and our resources can be leveraged to develop
additional products and services. We may pursue initiatives to create new or enhanced revenue streams or, alternatively, to increase audience engagement even when we have not identified any potential related revenue stream. New business initiatives
present risks and challenges that may be different from the ones we have faced in the past. In addition, later events may alter the risks that were evaluated at the time decisions are made on specific initiatives. Failure to effectively identify and
assess new business initiatives and to successfully implement them may adversely affect our company and its prospects.      The
healthcare industry in the United States and relationships among healthcare payers, providers and consumers are very complicated. In addition, the Internet and the market for online and mobile services are relatively new and still evolving.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to our business from our responses to those trends will be achieved. In addition, the market for healthcare information services is
highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends, but the trends may also attract additional competitors.  
   Background Information on Certain Significant Developments and Transactions    
  Stock Repurchases.     On September 16, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $35,198 to our
stock repurchase program (which we refer to as the Program), bringing the total then available under the Program to $50,000. During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 432,072 shares of our Common Stock at an
aggregate cost of $22,447 under the Program. During 2015, we repurchased 688,467 shares of our Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $28,406 under the Program, of which the entire 688,467 shares were purchased in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, $46,807 remained available for repurchases under the Program.

   Convertible Notes.     On January 11, 2011, we issued $400,000
aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible Notes due 2018 (which we refer to as the 2.50% Notes) in a private offering. Unless previously converted, the 2.50% Notes will mature on January 31, 2018. Net proceeds from the sale of the 2.50%
Notes were approximately $387,345, after deducting the related offering expenses, of which approximately $100,000 was used by us to repurchase 1,920,490 shares of WebMD Common Stock at a price of $52.07 per share, the last reported sale price of
WebMD Common Stock on January 5, 2011, which repurchase settled on January 11, 2011. Interest on the 2.50% Notes is payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year, commencing July 31, 2011. Under the terms of
the 2.50% Notes, as adjusted following completion of tender offers by WebMD for its Common Stock in 2012, 2013 and 2014, holders may surrender their 2.50% Notes for conversion into WebMD Common Stock at a conversion rate of 15.5118 shares of WebMD
Common Stock per thousand dollars principal amount of the 2.50% Notes. This is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $64.47 per share of Common Stock. In the aggregate, the 2.50% Notes were convertible into 6,204,720 shares of Common
Stock as of September 30, 2016.    On March 14, 2011, we issued $400,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Convertible Notes due
2016 (which we refer to as the 2.25% Notes) in a private offering. The 2.25% Notes matured on March 31, 2016 and the remaining outstanding principal amount of $102,682 was repaid.  
 On November 26, 2013, we issued $300,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.50% Convertible Notes due 2020 (which we refer to as the 1.50%
Notes) in a private offering. Unless previously converted, the 1.50% Notes will mature on December 1, 2020. Net proceeds from the sale of the 1.50% Notes were approximately $291,823, after deducting the related offering expenses. Interest on
the 1.50% Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2014. Under the terms of the 1.50% Notes, as adjusted in September 2014 following completion of a tender offer by WebMD for its Common
Stock, holders may surrender their 1.50% Notes for conversion into WebMD Common Stock at a conversion rate of 18.9795 shares of Common Stock per thousand dollars principal amount of the 1.50% Notes. This is equivalent to a conversion price of
approximately $52.69 per share of Common Stock. In the aggregate, the 1.50% Notes were convertible into 5,693,850 shares of Common Stock as of September 30, 2016.  
 On June 1, 2016, we issued $360,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Notes due 2023 (which we refer to as the 2.625%
Notes) in a private offering. Unless previously converted, the 2.625% Notes will mature on June 15, 2023. Net proceeds from the sale of the 2.625% Notes were approximately $350,394, after deducting the related offering expenses. Interest on the
2.625% Notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2016. Under the terms of the 2.625% Notes, holders may surrender their 2.625% Notes for conversion into WebMD Common Stock at a
conversion rate of 11.4845 shares of Common Stock per thousand dollars principal amount of the 2.625% Notes. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $87.07 per share of Common Stock. In the aggregate, the 2.625% Notes were
convertible into 4,134,420 shares of Common Stock as of September 30, 2016. The conversion rate may be adjusted under certain circumstances.  
   Seasonality      The
timing of our revenue is affected by seasonal factors. Our public portal advertising and sponsorship revenue is seasonal, primarily due to the annual spending patterns of the advertising and sponsorship clients of our public portals. This
portion of our revenue is usually the lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year, and generally increases during each consecutive quarter throughout the year. The timing of revenue in relation to our expenses, many of which do not vary
directly with revenue, has an impact on cost of operations, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter.

   Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies   
   Critical Accounting Estimates    
 Our MD A is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience, current business factors, and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities, the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic and political factors, and changes in our business
environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations; if
material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.    We evaluate our
estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, the carrying value of long-lived assets (including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), the amortization period of
long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), the carrying value, capitalization and amortization of software and Website development costs, the carrying value of investments, the provision for income taxes and
related deferred tax accounts, certain accrued expenses, contingencies, litigation and related legal accruals and the value attributed to employee stock options and other stock-based awards.  
   Critical Accounting Policies    
 We believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements:      

Revenue Recognition.     Revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered or as publications are distributed. Revenue from sponsorship arrangements, content syndication
and distribution arrangements and subscriptions to our  WebMD Health Services  platform as well as related health coaching and condition management services is recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement. Revenue from
information services is recognized as the underlying data is delivered. Revenue from the sponsorship of CME is recognized over the period that we substantially complete our contractual deliverables as determined by the applicable agreements.
     Contracts that contain multiple deliverables are subject to Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13
Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU 2009-13). ASU 2009-13 requires the allocation of revenue to each deliverable of multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. It also defines the
level of evidence of selling price required to separate deliverables and allows a company to make its best estimate of the selling price of deliverables when more objective evidence of selling price is not available.  
 Pursuant to the guidance of ASU 2009-13, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, we allocate revenue to each deliverable
based on relative selling price. The selling price for a deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE
is available. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our revenue recognition policies over the period that delivery occurs. VSOE of selling price is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately. In
determining VSOE, GAAP requires that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical pricing trends for specific products and services. TPE is  
      29  

Table of Contents  

based on competitor prices of similar deliverables when sold separately. We are generally not able to determine TPE of selling price as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors 
selling prices are for comparable services, combined with the fact that our services often contain unique features and customizations such that comparable services do not exist. The determination of best estimate of selling price is a judgmental
process that considers multiple factors including, but not limited to, recent selling prices and related discounting practices for each service, market conditions, customer classes, sales channels and other factors.  

Long-Lived Assets.     Our long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have
made. The amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on fair value using exit price and market participant view, such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models. Our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service. We evaluate the carrying
value and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, whenever indicators of impairment are present. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
annually, or whenever indicators of impairment are present. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level only when, after completing a qualitative analysis, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the
reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Long-lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. There was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2015 or during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016.        

Stock-Based Compensation.     Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value. The grant date fair value for stock
options is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. We recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term
of the share-based payment awards. As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $37,621 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to unvested stock options and restricted stock held by
employees, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years, related to our stock-based compensation plans.        

Deferred Taxes.     Our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits. These net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits
may be used to offset taxable income in future periods, reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay. A significant portion of our net deferred tax assets, including the portion related to excess tax benefits of stock-based
awards, are reserved for by a valuation allowance as required by relevant accounting literature. Management determines the need for a valuation allowance by assessing the probability of realizing deferred tax assets, taking into consideration
factors including historical operating results, expectations of future earnings and taxable income. Management will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in the future.    

Tax Contingencies.     Our tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by tax authorities. These potential
exposures result from applications of various statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations. Our estimates of tax contingencies reflect assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions. We believe that these assumptions
and judgments are reasonable. However, our accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued. Consistent with our
historical financial reporting, we have elected to reflect interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision.

   Results of Operations   
 The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data and expresses that data as a percentage of revenue for the
periods presented:      

(a) 
 Amounts may not add due to rounding.      Revenue is derived from four groups. The first group is
 Advertising and Sponsorship   Biopharma and Medical Device  and consists of advertising and sponsorship revenue from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device clients relating to ethical pharmaceutical products or other
regulated devices or products or for sponsoring educational programs. The second category is  Advertising and Sponsorship   OTC, CPG and Other  and consists of advertising and sponsorship revenue relating to non-Rx or
over-the-counter medications and other healthcare products, food and beverages, beauty products and other consumer products, as well as revenue from clients such as retailers, pharmacies, hospitals, health insurance companies and government
agencies. The combined revenue of the first two groups is sometimes referred to as  Advertising and Sponsorship  revenue. The third group is  Health Services  (which we previously referred to as  Private Portal
Services ) and consists of revenue from employers and health plans for subscriptions to our  WebMD Health Services  platform and related services, including health coaching and condition management services. The change in the name of this
group to  Health Services  does not reflect any change in the source of the revenue included in this group from prior periods. The fourth group is  Information Services  and consists of revenue from the sale of stand-alone
information and data products.    Cost of operations consists of salaries and related expenses, and non-cash stock-based compensation
expense related to providing and distributing services and products we provide to customers and costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our Websites, mobile applications and  WebMD Health Services  platform. Cost of operations
also consists of editorial and production costs, Website operations costs, non-capitalized Website development costs, costs we pay to our distribution partners, costs associated with our health and condition management programs and personalized
health coaching services, and costs related to the production and distribution of our publications, including costs related to creating and licensing content, telecommunications, leased properties and printing and distribution.  
 Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses, and non-cash stock-based compensation for account executives,
account management and marketing personnel, as well as costs and expenses for marketing programs, and fees for professional marketing and advertising services.  
      31  

Table of Contents  

  General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses and
non-cash stock-based compensation expense for administrative, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and executive personnel. Also included in general and administrative expense are costs of general insurance and professional
services expenses.    Our discussions throughout this MD A make references to certain non-cash expenses. Our principal non-cash expenses
are related to the awards of all share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors, such as grants of employee stock options and restricted stock. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is reflected in the same expense captions as the
related salary cost of the respective employee.    The following table is a summary of our non-cash expenses included in the respective
statements of operations captions:      
     Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
 The following discussion is a comparison of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
    Revenue     Our total
revenue increased 12.3% and 12.0% to $171,438 and $497,574 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from $152,607 and $444,270 in the prior year periods. The increases were due to increases in advertising and
sponsorship revenue of $17,354 and $49,521, increases in health services revenue of $787 and $1,911 and increases in information services revenue of $690 and $1,872, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, over the
prior year periods. A more detailed discussion regarding changes in these revenue groupings is included below under   Supplemental Financial and Operating Information.   
  Costs and Expenses   
  Cost of Operations.     Cost of operations was $65,458 and $193,759 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $59,552 and $177,836 in the prior year periods. As a percentage of revenue, cost of operations was 38.2% and 38.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared
to 39.0% and 40.0% for the prior year periods. Included in cost of operations were non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation of $1,277 and $3,707 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to
$1,370 and $3,791 in the prior year periods. Cost of operations, excluding such non-cash expenses, was $64,181 and $190,052 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, or 37.4% and 38.2% of revenue, compared to $58,182
and $174,045, or 38.1% and 39.2% of revenue, for the prior year periods. The increase in absolute dollars for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods was primarily attributable to the increased
expense associated with the delivery of our advertising and sponsorship programs and the operations of our Websites. The decrease in cost of operations expense as a percentage of revenue, excluding such non-cash expenses discussed
 
      32  

Table of Contents  

above, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods was primarily due to the increase in our revenue of 12.3% and 12.0%, respectively, without a
commensurate increase in cost of operations expenses as many of our expenses are fixed in nature.     Sales and
Marketing.     Sales and marketing expense was $35,264 and $104,634 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $32,850 and $97,896 in the prior year periods. As a percentage of
revenue, sales and marketing expense was 20.6% and 21.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 21.5% and 22.0% for the prior year periods. Included in sales and marketing expense were non-cash expenses related to
stock-based compensation of $1,351 and $4,295 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,968 and $5,099 in the prior year periods. Sales and marketing expense, excluding such non-cash expenses, was
$33,913 and $100,339 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, or 19.8% and 20.2% of revenue, compared to $30,882 and $92,797, or 20.2% and 20.9% of revenue, for the prior year periods. The decrease in sales and
marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, excluding such non-cash expenses discussed above, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods was primarily due to the increase in our revenue of 12.3%
and 12.0%, respectively, without a commensurate increase in sales in marketing expenses as many of our expenses are fixed in nature.  
  General and Administrative.     General and administrative expense was $20,005 and $67,744 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $22,942 and $67,397 in the prior year periods. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense was 11.7% and 13.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, respectively, compared to 15.0% and 15.2% for the prior year periods. Included in general and administrative expense were non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation of $2,010 and $13,036 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $5,804 and $15,841 in the prior year periods. The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior year
periods, was primarily due to the net reversal of $2,394 of stock-based compensation expense recorded in prior periods for stock-based awards that were forfeited by our former Chief Executive Officer and our former Chief Financial Officer upon their
termination of employment in September 2016. General and administrative expense, excluding such non-cash expenses, was $17,995 and $54,708 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, or 10.5% and 11.0% of revenue,
compared to $17,138 and $51,556, or 11.2% and 11.6% of revenue, for the prior year periods. The decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue, excluding the non-cash expenses discussed above, for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods, was primarily due to the increase in our revenue of 12.3% and 12.0%, respectively, without a commensurate increase in sales in marketing expenses as many of our expenses are
fixed in nature.     Depreciation and Amortization.     Depreciation and amortization expense was $7,912 and
$23,071 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $7,266 and $23,103 in the prior year periods.  
  Interest Income.     Interest income was $1,034 and $1,607 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, respectively, compared to $10 and $36 in the prior year periods. The increases in interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from higher average rates of return on our investments as well as
higher average investment balances during these periods due to the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2.625% Notes on June 1, 2016.  
  Interest Expense.     Interest expense was $7,065 and $17,430 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, respectively, compared to $5,681 and $18,024 in the prior year periods. These amounts included non-cash interest expense, related to the amortization of debt issuance costs for convertible debt, of $1,077 and $2,827 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,020 and $3,276 in the prior year periods. The increase in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior year period, was primarily due to
the issuance of $360,000 principal amount of our  
      33  

Table of Contents  

2.625% Notes on June 1, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our interest expense decreased, compared to the prior year period, due to a lower weighted average
outstanding balance of convertible notes during the period.     Loss on Convertible Notes.     During the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a loss on convertible notes of $2,058 related to the repurchase of $149,550 principal amount of our 2.25% Notes.  
  Gain on Investments.     Gain on investments of $139 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 represents
the gain from the sale of a portion of our investment in an equity security.     Other Expense.     Other expense
of $1,712 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 represents cash severance and related expenses due to the termination of employment of our former Chief Executive Officer and our former Chief Financial Officer in September 2016.
Other expense of $4,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 represents a charge related to the resolution of a patent infringement claim made against us by International Business Machines Corporation.  
  Income Tax Provision.     The income tax provision was $13,438 and $35,715 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $9,080 and $17,468 in the prior year periods. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the income tax provision represented 38.3% and 39.3% of pre-tax income,
respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the income tax provision represented 40.8% and 32.3% of pre-tax income, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower than our statutory tax rate for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 as the income tax provision included a non-cash income tax benefit of $4,724 due to the reversal of an income tax valuation allowance. This benefit reflects a correcting adjustment, made in the quarter ended
June 30, 2015, to the income tax valuation allowance originally recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012, which increased our net loss in that year.  
  Net Income.     Net income increased to $21,618 and $55,116 during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $13,188 and $36,563 in the prior year periods. As a percentage of revenue, net income was 12.6% and 11.1% of revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
compared to 8.6% and 8.2% of revenue in the prior year periods. These increases as a percentage of revenue were primarily due to the higher revenue in 2016. Many of our expenses are fixed in nature and do not vary directly with revenue and,
accordingly, our net income as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in our revenue.

   Supplemental Financial and Operating Information   
 The following table and the discussion that follows presents information for groups of revenue based on similar services we provide, as well as
information related to a non-GAAP performance measure that we use to monitor the performance of our business and which we refer to as  Earnings before interest, taxes, non-cash and other items  or  Adjusted EBITDA.  Due to the
fact that Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, we have also included a reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA.      
   The following discussion is a comparison of the results of operations for our groups of revenue, our net
income and our Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     Advertising and
Sponsorship.     Advertising and sponsorship revenue was $136,074 and $390,260 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, increases of $17,354 and $49,521, or 14.6% and 14.5%, from the prior year
periods. The increases in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the prior year periods were primarily attributable to the increased adoption of our advertising and sponsorship offerings by biopharma and medical
device companies, which represented increases of $17,178 and $44,661, respectively, and by our OTC, CPG and other customers, which represented increases of $176 and $4,860, respectively. In general, pricing remained relatively stable for our public
portal advertising and sponsorship offerings and was not a significant source of the revenue increase.     Health
Services.     Health services revenue was $28,247 and $85,134 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, increases of $787 and $1,911, or 2.9% and 2.3%, from the prior year periods. The slight
increases in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in services provided. In general, pricing remained relatively stable for our  WebMD Health Services  platform and related
services and was not a significant source of the revenue increase. The number of customers using our  WebMD Health Services  platform at September 30, 2016 was 87 compared to 91 customers using our  WebMD Health Services  platform at
September 30, 2015.

   Information Services.     Information services revenue was $7,117 and
$22,180 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, increases of $690 and $1,872, or 10.7% and 9.2%, from the prior year periods. The increases were attributable to an increase in the number of customers licensing our
information services and an increase in the rates charged for our information services.     Adjusted
EBITDA.     Adjusted EBITDA increased to $55,349 and $152,475 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $46,405 and $125,872 in the prior year periods. As a percentage of
revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 32.3% and 30.6% of revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 30.4% and 28.3% of revenue in the prior year periods. These increases as a percentage of revenue were
primarily due to the higher revenue in 2016. Many of our expenses are fixed in nature and do not vary directly with revenue and, accordingly, our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in our
revenue.     Explanatory Note Regarding Adjusted EBITDA.    Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should
be viewed as supplemental to, and not as an alternative for,  net income (loss)  calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an additional measure of performance for purposes of business decision-making,
including developing budgets, managing expenditures, and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA help our management identify additional trends in financial results that may not be shown
solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income (loss). We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons why our management finds it useful and
because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by our management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions. In addition, we believe that providing Adjusted EBITDA, together with a reconciliation of net
income to Adjusted EBITDA, helps investors make comparisons between us and other companies that may have different capital structures, different effective income tax rates and tax attributes, different capitalized asset values and/or different forms
of employee compensation. Please see the  Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Information  filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report for additional background information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA. Exhibit 99.1
is incorporated in this MD A by reference.      Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $88,600 of cash and cash equivalents, and working capital of $1,041,172. Our operating cash flows are
affected by the timing of each period end in relation to items such as payments received from customers, payments made to vendors, the timing of interest payments related to our convertible debt, and internal payroll and billing cycles, as well as
the seasonality within our business. Accordingly, our working capital, and its impact on cash flow from operations, can fluctuate materially from period to period.  
 Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $122,277, which related to net income of
$55,116, adjusted for a non-cash income tax provision of $6,632 related to deferred income taxes, and other non-cash expenses of $46,936, which include depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash interest expense and non-cash stock-based
compensation expense. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in an increase in cash of $13,593, primarily due to cash provided as a result of a decrease in accounts receivable of $21,058 and a decrease in prepaid and
other assets of $2,747, which was offset by cash used as a result of a decrease in accrued liabilities of $9,748 and a decrease in deferred revenue of $464.  
 Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $77,178, which related to net income of
$36,563, adjusted for a non-cash income tax benefit of $7,246 related to deferred income taxes, a loss on convertible notes of $2,058, a gain on investments of $139, and other non-cash expenses of $51,110, which include depreciation and amortization
expense, non-cash interest expense and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in cash of $5,168, primarily due to cash used as a result of an increase in accounts
receivable of $10,201, an

increase in prepaid and other assets of $5,692, and a decrease in accrued liabilities of $4,555, which was offset by cash provided by an increase in deferred revenue of $15,280.  
 Cash used in investing activities was $971,334 and $25,499 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $948,078 in cash to purchase short-term investments. Cash used in investing activities included purchases of property and equipment of $24,449 and $25,638 in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Also included in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was the receipt of $1,193 related to the partial redemption of a cost-method investment. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, we also received $139 in cash proceeds from the sale of a portion of our investment in an equity security.  
 Cash provided by financing activities was $296,492 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash used in financing activities was
$146,123 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to the issuance of $360,000 principal amount of our 2.625% Notes for which we
received $350,394 in net proceeds, after deducting the related issuance costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used cash of $102,682 to repay our 2.25% Notes which matured on March 31, 2016. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, we used cash of $151,038 to repurchase a portion of our 2.25% Notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we received cash proceeds of $52,702 and $15,185, respectively, related to the
exercise of stock options, and used cash of $7,705 and $3,836, respectively, for withholding taxes on stock-based awards. Cash flows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 also include excess tax
benefits on stock-based awards of $26,230 and $21,972, respectively. Additionally, we used cash of $22,447 and $28,406 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to repurchase shares of our Common Stock through our
authorized repurchase program.    Potential future uses of cash include repurchases of our Common Stock and our anticipated capital
expenditure requirements for 2016, which we currently estimate to be approximately $30 million (of which, approximately $6 million will be in the quarter ending December 31, 2016) and which primarily relate to improvements that will be deployed
across our Websites in order to enable us to service future growth in unique users and page views, as well as to create new sponsorship areas for our customers, and to improve the systems used to provide our  WebMD Health Services  platform.
   Based on our plans and expectations, we believe that our available cash resources and future cash flow from operations will provide
sufficient cash resources to meet the cash commitments of our convertible notes and to fund our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements, for at least the next 24 months. Our future liquidity and capital
requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including retention of customers at current volume and revenue levels, implementation of new or updated application and service offerings, competing technological and market developments and potential
future acquisitions. In addition, our ability to generate cash flow is subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including general economic, regulatory and other matters affecting us and our customers. We plan to continue to enhance our online
services and to continue to invest in acquisitions, strategic relationships, facilities and technological infrastructure and product development. We intend to grow each of our existing businesses and enter into complementary ones through both
internal investments and acquisitions. We may need to raise additional funds to support expansion, develop new or enhanced applications and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take
advantage of unanticipated opportunities. If required, we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. We cannot assure that such financing will be available on
acceptable terms, if at all, or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders. Future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for
unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During 2016    
 In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-12,  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the
Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period,  which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a
performance condition. The revised guidance was effective for us beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of the revised guidance did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements as we do not have any
share-based awards with performance targets currently outstanding.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest
  Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The revised guidance was effective for us, on a retrospective basis, beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of the revised guidance only affected the
balance sheet classification of our debt issuance costs.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,  Intangibles
  Goodwill and Other     Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement , which provides guidance in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement
includes a software license. If it is determined that a cloud computing arrangement does include a software license, the software element should be accounted for consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not
include a software license, it should be accounted for as a service contract. The revised guidance was effective for us beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and will be applied prospectively to all arrangements entered into or
materially modified after the effective date. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for
Measurement-Period Adjustments , which requires that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, rather than
retrospectively adjusting previously reported amounts. The revised guidance was effective for us beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which
requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent. The revised guidance
was required to be effective for us beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2017 and could be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption was permitted
and we elected to early adopt the guidance in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of the revised guidance only affected the balance sheet classification of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the
related valuation allowance.      Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted in the Future    
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , to achieve a consistent
application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under GAAP. Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the revised guidance requires  
      38  

Table of Contents  

that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,  which delays the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. As a result, the revised guidance is effective for us beginning in the
quarter ending March 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of the guidance. The revised guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively
with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent
Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , and ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , respectively. ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10 and ASU No. 2016-12 provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASU No. 2014-09, and
must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. We have not yet determined the impact that the revised guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which revises the classification and measurement of investments in certain equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for certain financial liabilities measured at fair
value. ASU No. 2016-01 also requires the change in fair value of many equity investments to be recognized in net income. The revised guidance is effective for us beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2018. We have not yet
determined the impact that the revised guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments
arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The revised guidance must be applied on a
modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The revised guidance is effective for us beginning in the quarter
ending March 31, 2019. We have not yet determined the impact the revised guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and
(c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The revised guidance is effective for us beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the impact the revised guidance will have
on our consolidated financial statements.    In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit
Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. The revised guidance is effective for
us beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2020 and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach. We have not yet determined the impact the revised guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments , which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The revised guidance is effective for us beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2018 with early adoption
permitted and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We have not yet determined the impact the revised guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 3.  
     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk        
   Interest Rate Sensitivity    
 The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity.  
 The value of our cash, and cash equivalents, which was $88.6 million at September 30, 2016, is not subject to changes in interest rates.
The value of our investments, which was $949.5 million at September 30, 2016, is subject to changes in interest rates; however, due to the short term nature of these investments, any changes are not expected to be material.  
 The 2.50% Notes, the 1.50% Notes and the 2.625% Notes have fixed interest rates; therefore, changes in interest rates will not impact our
results of operations or financial position.      Exchange Rate Sensitivity    
 Substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in United States dollars; however, a portion of the revenue from our
international operations was contracted in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in exchange rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 has been reflected in our results of operations and was not material, and
future changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.      

ITEM 4.  
     Controls and Procedures          As required by Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(b), WebMD management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of WebMD s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of
September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that WebMD s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  
 In connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d), WebMD management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer, concluded that there were no changes in WebMD s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, WebMD s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1.  
     Legal Proceedings          The information relating to legal proceedings
contained in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report is incorporated herein by this reference.      

ITEM 1A.  
     Risk Factors           This section describes circumstances or events
that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change, for the worse, existing trends in some or all of our businesses. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of our Common Stock and Convertible Notes or of securities that we may issue in the future. The risks and uncertainties
described in this Quarterly Report are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business and operations.   
         
  Risks Related to Our Operations and the Healthcare Content We Provide   
   If we are unable to provide content and services that attract users to The WebMD Health Network on a consistent basis, our advertising
and sponsorship revenue could be reduced      Users of  The WebMD Health Network  have numerous other online and offline sources
of healthcare information and related services. Our ability to compete for user traffic on our public portals depends upon our ability to make available a variety of health, wellness and medical content, decision-support applications and other
services that meet the needs of a variety of types of users, including consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals, with a variety of reasons for seeking information. Our ability to do so depends, in turn, on:  

our ability to hire and retain qualified authors, journalists and independent writers and healthcare professionals;        

our ability to license quality content from third parties; and        

our ability to monitor and respond to increases and decreases in user interest in specific topics.    
 If consumers and healthcare professionals do not perceive our content, applications and tools to be useful, reliable and trustworthy, we may
not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement with our health information services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop or acquire needed content,
applications and tools at a reasonable cost. In addition, since consumer users of our public portals may be attracted to  The WebMD Health Network  as a result of a specific condition or for a specific purpose, it is difficult for us to predict
the rate at which they will return to our public portals. Because we generate revenue by, among other things, selling sponsorships of specific pages, sections or events on  The WebMD Health Network , a decline in user traffic levels or a
reduction in the number of pages viewed by users could cause our advertising and sponsorship revenue to decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, overall traffic to  The WebMD Health Network  does
not have a direct correlation to our advertising and sponsorship revenue, which can continue to grow even if overall traffic were to remain constant or go down. Our ability to generate advertising and sponsorship revenue depends primarily on our
ability to create content on specific topics and to program various parts of  The WebMD Health Network  to build and maintain traffic in areas most important to both our audience and our advertising and sponsorship clients. If we are unable to
do that, our advertising and sponsorship revenue could decrease even if our overall traffic remains the same or increases.

    A significant portion of the traffic to The WebMD Health Network is directed to us through
algorithmic search results on Internet search engines and, if we are listed less prominently in search result listings or our traffic from search is otherwise reduced, our business and operating results could be harmed    
 A significant portion of the traffic to  The WebMD Health Network  is directed to us through the algorithmic search results on Internet
search engines. In addition to providing quality content and tools, we seek to produce and deliver our content and tools in ways that will cause them to rank well in algorithmic search engine results, which makes it more likely that search engine
users will visit our Websites. This is commonly referred to as search engine optimization, or SEO. However, there can be no assurance that our SEO efforts will succeed in improving the ranking of our content or, even if they do result in such
improvement, that the improved ranking will result in increased numbers of users and page views for our Websites. In addition, search engines frequently change the criteria that determine site rankings in their search results or make other changes
and our SEO efforts may not be successful if we do not respond to those changes appropriately and on a timely basis. Search engine providers may also prioritize search results generated by certain types of queries, including health-related queries,
based on criteria they select, which could, in some circumstances, reduce the ranking that would otherwise be provided to our Websites and increase the ranking of other sites. If we are unable to respond effectively to changes made by search engine
providers in their algorithms and other processes or to respond effectively to other factors and challenges that may impair our ability to attract traffic through search, a substantial decrease in traffic to  The WebMD Health Network  could
occur, which could cause our revenue to decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict if, or how long, efforts to improve SEO or otherwise increase traffic may take to mitigate any such declines.
   Search engine providers also typically display, together with algorithmic search results, content and links that may divert traffic from
the pages referenced in the algorithmic search results, including: advertisements that are presented with the algorithmic search results for which the search engine provider receives compensation (sometimes referred to as paid search results); and
health-related or other content and links that the search engine provider selects and displays in response to the specific search queries in a format determined by the search engine provider. Accordingly, even if we rank highly in algorithmic search
results, traffic to our Websites may be reduced as a result of the paid search results and other content included on the search results page generated by a search query. We cannot control the amount, quality or presentation of such paid search
results and other content and, accordingly, we cannot predict any reductions in our traffic that may occur from time to time as search engine providers make changes in their policies and procedures regarding paid search results or regarding content
they provide. In addition, to the extent that there is a reduction in the total volume of health-related searches on Internet search engines, traffic to  The WebMD Health Network  could also be reduced and we may have little or no ability to
take steps to mitigate the effect on our traffic. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, declines in traffic to  The WebMD Health Network  from search for reasons that we are unable to identify. Any
resulting reduction in our traffic for any of the reasons described above, if significant, could cause our revenue to decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  
   If we fail to maintain successful monetization strategies for smartphone traffic, our financial results could be adversely affected
     The number of people, including the number of physicians and other healthcare professionals, who access online content and
services through smartphones has increased rapidly and is expected to continue to increase. Accordingly, the portion of our page views from smartphones has increased rapidly and is expected to continue to increase. The monetization of smartphone
page views can be challenging because of the smaller screen size. If we are unable to maintain successful monetization strategies for smartphone traffic, our financial results could be negatively affected.

    We face significant competition for our healthcare information products and services
     The markets for healthcare information products and services are intensely competitive, continually evolving and, in some cases,
subject to rapid change.      

The WebMD Health Network  faces competition from numerous other companies, both in attracting users and in generating revenue from advertisers and sponsors. We compete for users with Websites and mobile
applications that provide health-related information, including both commercial ones and not-for-profit ones. We compete for advertisers and sponsors with: health-related Websites and mobile applications; general interest consumer Websites that
offer specialized health sub-channels or functions; other high-traffic Websites that include both healthcare-related and non-healthcare-related content and services, including social media Websites; search engines that provide specialized health
search capabilities; and advertising networks that aggregate traffic from multiple sites.  The WebMD Health Network  also faces competition from: traditional media and offline publications and information services; and manufacturers and
distributors of activity trackers, heart rate monitors, blood pressure monitors and similar devices relating to health and wellness that can download data to a PC, tablet or smartphone, as well as numerous other companies developing applications and
tools for use with those devices.        

Our  WebMD Health Services  platform and related services, including health coaching and condition management services compete with: providers of decision-support and transparency tools that assist in evaluating
health insurance coverage options and healthcare provider and treatment options; online health management applications, including personal health records; wellness and disease management vendors; and competing services provided by health insurance
companies, employee benefits services companies, and their affiliates. Employers may also decide to develop similar solutions for their own populations rather than obtaining solutions from  WebMD Health Services  or its competitors.
     Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than we do.
These organizations may be better known than we are and may have more customers or users than we do. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations. In addition, we expect that competitors will
continue to enter these markets. The competition we face for our services may result in fewer or smaller customer commitments or pressure to reduce prices, which could reduce our profit margins.  
   Developing and implementing new and updated services may be more difficult than expected and may not result in sufficient increases in
revenue to justify the costs      In order to attract and retain users of our Websites and mobile applications and clients for our
 WebMD Health Services  platform and related services, we must continue to improve the technology underlying our services and continue to develop new and updated offerings. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or if we are unable to
implement new offerings without disruption to our existing ones, we may lose potential users and clients. For example, we are in the process of working to enable users to more easily discover, share and interact with content from WebMD not just on
our Websites but also in other online locations and, in support of this initiative, we are creating new content offerings tailored for specific social networks and platforms and building our capabilities to create video content. If we are not
successful in creating content offerings that support this initiative, our ability to compete for advertising and sponsorship revenue may be reduced. Even if we are successful in creating such content offerings and users respond favorably, there can
be no assurance that we will be able to adequately monetize audience usage of such content or to drive sufficient traffic to our own Websites to make this initiative profitable.  
 We rely on a combination of internal development, strategic relationships, licensing and acquisitions to develop our Websites, mobile
applications and related features and services. Our development and/or implementation of new technologies, features and services may cost more than expected, may take longer than originally expected, may require more testing than originally
anticipated and may require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources. There can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from any new or updated technologies, applications, features or services will justify the amounts
spent.

    Failure to effectively identify, assess and pursue new business initiatives could adversely
affect our company and its prospects      We are working to broaden our portfolio of services and taking steps to diversify our client
base and revenue streams. The development of new products and services in response to evolving trends in healthcare and evolving technologies for Internet-based and mobile services, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this
dynamic environment, requires significant time and resources. We may not be able to respond quickly enough or in a cost-effective manner, appropriately time the introduction of new products and services to the market or identify new business
opportunities in a timely manner. In addition, while evolving technologies may offer new opportunities, they may also present additional challenges, including challenges relating to security and privacy.  
 Some of the business initiatives we are working on have challenges that are different from those associated with our existing products and
services and could strain our financial, operational and management resources. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the potential revenue streams from any investments that we may make in pursuing new business opportunities will justify the
amounts spent. Failure to effectively identify, assess and pursue new business initiatives may adversely affect our company and its prospects.  
   Failure to continue to enhance the analytic capabilities we use to demonstrate the value of our services to advertisers and sponsors
could adversely affect our ability to market our services      We continue to work to enhance the analytic capabilities we use to
demonstrate to advertisers and sponsors how promotional strategies implemented through  The WebMD Health Network  impact physician and consumer behaviors and preferences. Our ability to demonstrate the value of advertising and sponsorship on
 The WebMD Health Network  depends, in part, on our ability to provide accurate and reliable analytics and measurement capabilities and to continue to improve such capabilities. If we are unable to demonstrate such analytic capabilities, it
could adversely affect our ability to market our services or to satisfy client expectations and commitments that rely on analytics to measure performance and, as a result, we may lose business to competitors even if our advertising and sponsorship
services are superior to theirs.      Restrictions on our ability to access or use various forms and sources of data could adversely
impact our business      We are increasingly using data analytics based on information that we collect regarding usage of our public
portals, as well as other third party sources of data. Our use of data regarding users of our public portals is governed by the privacy policies posted on those sites and is designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations as is our use of
any third-party data. In addition, we sell certain information products and services on a stand-alone basis using de-identified data that we license from a small number of third party data sources, of which the principal source is a license retained
by HLTH Corporation (HLTH) in connection with the sale of its Emdeon Business Services (EBS) business. As the successor to HLTH, we received this license, which provides us the rights to certain de-identified data from the operation of the EBS
business (which is now known as Change Healthcare) through early February 2018 for use in the development and commercialization of various information products and services as to which we pay Change Healthcare a royalty. To date, these stand-alone
information products and services do not include any data derived from the operation of our Websites. We are seeking to acquire additional third-party data sources and to develop data generated from our Website operations in order to strengthen and
diversify our data product offerings. Revenue from the stand-alone products and services that utilize data under the current Change Healthcare license is highly profitable and is recorded net of royalties and commissions paid by us to Change
Healthcare or others. To date, we have not used data we license from Change Healthcare to support our current advertising business.    We do
not expect that the current license agreement with Change Healthcare will continue after February 2018, and expect that if such agreement is renewed or is replaced with new third party data sources, the terms of any such renewal or replacement
license would not be as favorable to us as those in the current agreement.

Change Healthcare is in the process of merging with McKesson Corporation and, as a result, discussions around extending our agreement with Change Healthcare have stalled. We are exploring other
sources of third-party data and uses of our first party data to generate additional revenue streams, but we are early in that process. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that the sales of, or the profits generated by, our stand-alone
information products would not be materially adversely affected by the expiration, in early February 2018, of our license agreement with Change Healthcare. This will not impact our 2016 or 2017 revenue or earnings, but would have an impact in 2018.
   Changes to our ability to access or use data could adversely affect our ability to implement improved analytics or to offer information
products on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, our business could be adversely impacted if, for any reason (including, but not limited to, changes in applicable laws and regulations) the data we use becomes unavailable or the conditions on its
availability are not commercially reasonable or are inconsistent with our planned usage. In addition, the quality of our data analytics depends on the reliability of the information that we are able to obtain. If the information we use contains
errors or is otherwise unreliable, analyses we create and actions we take based on those analyses could be wrong, which could hurt our reputation and business.  
   Failure to maintain and enhance the  WebMD  and  Medscape  brands and our other brands could have a material adverse
effect on our business      We believe that the  WebMD  and  Medscape  brand identities that we have developed have
contributed to the success of our business and have helped us achieve recognition as a trusted source of health and wellness information and tools for consumers and of online content for physicians and other healthcare professionals. We also believe
that maintaining and enhancing those brands is important to expanding the user base for  The WebMD Health Network  and to our relationships with sponsors and advertisers. The  WebMD  brand is also important to our ability to gain
additional employer and healthcare payer clients for our  WebMD Health Services  platform and related services. We have expended considerable resources on establishing and enhancing the  WebMD  and  Medscape  brands and our
other brands, and we have developed policies and procedures designed to preserve and enhance our brands, including editorial procedures designed to provide quality control of the information we publish. We expect to continue to devote resources and
efforts to maintain and enhance our brands. However, we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance our brands, and events outside of our control may have a negative effect on our brands. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brands,
and do so in a cost-effective manner, our business could be adversely affected.      The markets we participate in are relatively new
and continue to change      We participate in relatively new markets. These markets, and our business, have undergone significant
changes during their short history and can be expected to continue to change. Many companies with business plans based on providing healthcare information and related services online and through mobile platforms have failed to be profitable and some
have filed for bankruptcy or ceased operations. Even if demand from users exists, we cannot assure you that our business will be profitable.  
 The standards that our advertising and sponsorship clients apply to our services continue to evolve, including standards for ad delivery,
placement and frequency and for measuring the effectiveness of our services as compared to other alternatives available to our clients. Our ability to meet such standards as they change in the future will be important to our ability to compete for
business, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to do so or estimate what the costs for doing so may be. For example, standards are continuing to evolve in the online advertising marketplace regarding the viewability of online
advertising, or the length of time an advertisement is visible to a user as determined by a third party verification source. We cannot predict how the requirements of advertisers will continue to evolve. If we fail to meet the standards that our
advertisers require, our advertising revenues could be reduced.      Our failure to attract and retain qualified executives and
employees may have a material adverse effect on our business      Our business depends largely on the skills, experience and
performance of key members of our management team and other key employees. We also depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified writers and  
      45  

Table of Contents  

editors, software developers and other technical personnel, healthcare professionals, and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the healthcare information services
and Internet industries is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be able to hire or retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to meet our requirements, or that we will be able to do so at costs that are acceptable to us. Failure to do
so may have an adverse effect on our business.      Our advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to
quarter and its amount and timing may be subject to factors beyond our control, including regulatory changes      Our advertising and
sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control, and some of which may be difficult to forecast accurately, including potential effects on demand for our
services as a result of regulatory changes affecting advertising and promotion of drugs and medical devices and general economic conditions. The majority of our advertising and sponsorship programs are for terms of approximately four to twelve
months. We have relatively few longer term advertising and sponsorship programs. We cannot assure you that our current advertisers and sponsors will continue to use our services beyond the terms of their existing contracts or that they will enter
into any additional contracts.    The time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific
program and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor for that program, as well as the additional time period before our services are delivered, may be longer than expected, especially for medium-sized and larger contracts, and may
be subject to delays over which we have little or no control, including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals, including internal approvals relating to compliance with the laws and
regulations applicable to the marketing of healthcare products. We have experienced, from time to time, a lengthening of this internal review process by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which has resulted in delays in contracting as well
as delays in recognizing expected revenue under executed contracts and which may continue to cause such delays. Other factors that could affect the timing of contracting for specific programs with advertisers and sponsors, or receipt of revenue
under such contracts, include the timing of:      

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for new products or for new indications or uses for approved products;        

any adverse determinations by the FDA affecting products previously approved or expected to be approved or the permitted uses of such products or their marketing;    

FDA approval of generic products that compete with existing brand name products and any increase in the number or significance of such approvals;    

recalls, withdrawals or shortages of products from the market;        

consolidation of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries;        

rollouts of new or enhanced services on our public portals;        

seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products; and    

the scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals.      Some of our
pharmaceutical company customers have experienced patent expirations for certain of their products in the past several years and some are expected to experience patent expirations over the next several years. In the pharmaceutical industry, patent
expirations allow for competition from lower-priced generic versions of the patented drugs and generally result in the termination of marketing efforts for the drug (unless the FDA awards regulatory exclusivities beyond the patent term). In
addition, expirations of patents that result in a significant reduction in revenue for a pharmaceutical company can lead to reductions in their advertising and sponsorship expenditures for other drugs in their product portfolios or for their entire
product portfolio.

    Applications and other software that can block advertisements could reduce demand for our
advertising and sponsorship products and decrease our revenue      We derive a significant portion of our revenue from advertising and
sponsorship on  The WebMD Health Network . Applications and software are available that can block or obscure the display of advertisements or block the cookies used to deliver such advertisements, or shift the location in which advertising
appears on pages. While the use of ad-blocking programs by visitors to  The WebMD Health Network  has been limited to date and our audience consists primarily of individuals who have not typically adopted ad-blocking programs so far, if these
programs gain acceptance among our users in the future, they could reduce our ability to deliver advertisements to our audience which, in turn, could reduce demand for our advertising and sponsorship products and cause our revenue from those
products to decrease.      Mergers and acquisitions among our clients may reduce the volume of our services purchased by the
consolidated company following such a transaction, which could harm our operating results      Mergers and acquisitions among our
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device company clients have in the past and could in the future reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. Similarly, mergers and acquisitions among health insurance company clients of our WebMD
Health Services platform could reduce the number of those clients. In addition, when companies consolidate, the number of vendors used for services, or the amount spent, by the separate companies may be reduced by the consolidated entity and some
vendors and services may no longer be used at all. Any such event could have a negative effect on our revenue and profitability and we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to mitigate any such negative effect.  
   We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to generate advertising and sponsorship revenue from consumer products companies    
 Much of our advertising and sponsorship revenue has, in the past, come from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies. We also
seek to generate advertising and sponsorship revenue from consumer products companies that are interested in communicating health-related or safety-related information about their products to our audience. However, while many consumer products
companies are increasing the portion of their promotional spending used on the Internet, we cannot assure you that these advertisers and sponsors will find our consumer Websites to be as effective for promoting their products and services as
competing channels, which include traditional media, Internet search engines, social media Internet sites, general interest consumer sites, and numerous other alternatives. Competition for this business may also result in smaller customer
commitments or pressure to reduce prices, both of which could reduce our profit margins even if we are able to generate revenue.    In
addition, revenues from consumer products companies are more likely to reflect general economic conditions, and to be reduced to a greater extent during economic downturns, than revenues from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device
companies. Accordingly, revenues from this portion of our business may be subject to significant quarter-to-quarter variations and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to develop it further.  
   Lengthy sales and implementation cycles for our WebMD Health Services platform and certain contractual rights of our clients make it
difficult to forecast our revenues and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations      The period from our initial contact
with a potential client for our  WebMD Health Services  platform and entry into a contract for a subscription to our solution by the client is difficult to predict. In the past, this period has generally ranged from six to twelve months, but in
some cases has been longer. Potential contracts may be subject to delays or cancellations due to a client s internal procedures for approving large expenditures and other factors beyond our control, including the effect of general economic
conditions on the willingness of potential clients to subscribe to our  WebMD Health Services  solution. The time it takes to implement our  WebMD Health Services  platform is also difficult to predict and has lasted as long as six months
from contract execution to the commencement of live operation. Implementation may be subject to delays based on the availability of the internal resources of the client that are needed and other factors outside of our control. As a result, we have
 
      47  

Table of Contents  

limited ability to forecast the timing of revenue from clients. This, in turn, makes it more difficult to forecast our financial performance for future periods and may have an adverse impact on
our results of operations.    During the contracting cycle and the implementation period, we may expend substantial time, effort and money
preparing contract proposals, negotiating contracts and implementing our  WebMD Health Services  platform without receiving any related revenue. In addition, many of the expenses related to providing our platform are relatively fixed in the
short term, including personnel costs and technology and infrastructure costs. If our health services revenue is lower than expected, we may not be able to reduce related short-term spending in response. Any shortfall in such revenue would have a
direct impact on our results of operations.    In addition, some of our client contracts permit termination, by the client, prior to the end
of the stated contract term for some or all of the services to be provided, which can make it more difficult to forecast our future financial performance and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.  
   Our ability to renew existing agreements with employers and health plans will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and
update our offerings and to increase usage of our services by their employees and plan members      In a healthcare market where a
greater share of the responsibility for healthcare costs and decision-making has been shifting to consumers, use of information technology (including personal health records) to assist consumers in making informed decisions about healthcare has also
increased. We believe that through our  WebMD Health Services  platform as well as our health coaching programs and our targeted condition management programs, we are well positioned to play a role in this environment. However, our strategy
depends, in part, on increasing usage of our services by our employer and health plan clients  employees and plan participants and being able to demonstrate a sufficient return on investment and other benefits for our clients from those
services. Increasing usage of our platform and related services requires us to continue to develop new and updated applications, features and services. In addition, there are numerous competitors for the services we provide, many of which have
greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than we do, and may be better known than we are. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to meet our development and implementation goals or that we will be
able to compete successfully against other vendors offering competitive services and, if we are unable to do so, we may experience static or diminished usage of our platform and related services, possible non-renewals of our customer agreements and,
since some customers have the right to terminate or modify existing agreements before the end of the full contract term, possible terminations for some or all of the services to be provided.  
   The condition management programs that we provide to clients of our WebMD Health Services platform involve risk and challenges with
which we have limited experience and may not be profitable      We provide condition management services to clients of our  WebMD
Health Services  platform and plan to continue to expand that portion of our business. Our current offerings include programs targeting individuals struggling with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and asthma. Our condition management programs include ongoing, intensive one-on-one coaching by condition specialists, along with targeted online resources and progress tracking tools. Providing condition management services
involves new risks and challenges for us, including: potential requirements to obtain and retain licenses, permits and regulatory clearances and approvals related to these services; difficulty in quantifying the costs savings and other benefits for
our clients from these services; and difficulty in differentiating our condition management services from those of competitors, some of whom may be able to provide such services at a lower cost. We cannot predict the demand among our existing
 WebMD Health Services  clients and other potential clients for our condition management services and cannot provide assurance that the revenue opportunities from providing our current offerings or ones for additional conditions will justify
the costs involved in maintaining or developing the required capabilities and delivering the services to clients.

    Contractual relationships with governmental customers may impose special burdens on us and
provide special benefits to those customers, including the right to change or terminate the contract in response to budgetary constraints or policy changes    
 A portion of our revenues come from customers that are governmental agencies or vendors to such agencies. Government contracts and subcontracts
may be subject to some or all of the following:      

termination when appropriated funding for the current fiscal year is exhausted or becomes unavailable;        

termination for the governmental customer s convenience, subject to a negotiated settlement for costs incurred and profit on work completed, along with the right to place contracts out for bid before the full
contract term, as well as the right to make unilateral changes in contract requirements, subject to negotiated price adjustments;        

most-favored  pricing disclosure requirements that are designed to ensure that the government can negotiate and receive pricing akin to that offered commercially and requirements to submit proprietary cost or
pricing data to ensure that government contract pricing is fair and reasonable;        

commercial customer price tracking requirements that require contractors to monitor pricing offered to a specified class of customers and to extend price reductions offered to that class of customers to the government;

reporting and compliance requirements related to, among other things: equal employment opportunity, affirmative action for veterans and for workers with disabilities, and accessibility for the disabled;

broader audit rights than we would usually grant to non-governmental customers; and        

specialized remedies for breach and default or failure to meet service level commitments, including setoff rights, retroactive price adjustments, and civil or criminal fraud penalties, as well as mandatory
administrative dispute resolution procedures instead of state contract law remedies.      In addition, certain violations of
federal law may subject government contractors to having their contracts terminated and, under certain circumstances, suspension and/or debarment from future government contracts.  
   Expansion to markets outside the United States subjects us to additional risks    
 One element of our growth strategy is to seek to expand our online services to markets outside the United States. In certain markets outside
the United States, we expect to accomplish this through partnerships or joint ventures with other companies having expertise in the specific country or region, while in other such markets we expect to rely primarily on our own internal resources. In
certain markets outside of the United States, we are providing some of our online services in the local language directly to healthcare professionals. We also provide our online services in English to healthcare professionals outside the United
States. Our participation in international markets is subject to certain risks beyond those applicable to our operations in the United States, such as:      

challenges caused by cultural differences;        

difficulties in staffing and managing operations from a distance;        

uncertainty regarding liability for services and content;        

potential burdens of complying with a wide variety of legal, regulatory and market requirements, as well as uncertainty as to the applicability of non-U.S. laws to operations based in the United States and regarding the
interpretation of such laws by local authorities;        

potential regulation or interpretation of existing regulation that could limit or eliminate our ability to distribute one or more of our products in one or more countries;    

variability of economic and political conditions, including the extent of the impact of adverse economic conditions in markets outside the United States;    

tariffs or other trade barriers;        

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;    
      49

potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriation of earnings; and        

difficulties in protecting intellectual property.      In addition, outside the United States, we
face competition from locally based companies that have experience doing business in their home countries or regions and familiarity with local business practices, customs and laws and, as a result, generally do not face, or are better positioned to
face, the risks described above.            
  Risks Related to the Internet and Our Technological Infrastructure   
   Any service interruption or failure in the systems that we use to provide online portals and other services could harm our business
     Our online portals and other services are designed to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without interruption. However, we
have experienced and expect that we will in the future experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center providers, bandwidth
providers and mobile carriers, to provide our online portals and other services. We may not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or
facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users. In addition, system failures may result in loss of data, including user registration data, business intelligence
data, content, and other data critical to the operation of our online portals and other services, which could cause significant harm to our business and our reputation.  
 To operate without interruption or loss of data, both we and our service providers must guard against:  

damage from fire, power loss and other natural disasters;        

communications failures;        

software and hardware errors, failures and crashes;        

security breaches, computer viruses, distributed denial-of-service attacks and similar disruptive problems; and        

other potential service interruptions.      Any disruption in the network access or co-location
services provided by third-party providers to us or any failure by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business. We exercise little control over these third-party
vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could
negatively impact our relationships with users and adversely affect our brand and our business and could expose us to liabilities to third parties. Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate
to compensate us for all losses that may occur. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.  
   Failure to update our technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business    
 Evolving technologies could require us to modify our technology infrastructure and any failure to do so on a timely basis may limit the types
of services we can provide or the quality of those services, and may put us in a weaker position relative to our competitors. Competitors with newer technology infrastructure may also have greater flexibility and be in a position to respond more
quickly than us to new opportunities, which may impact our competitive position in certain markets and adversely affect our business.  
      50  

Table of Contents  

    Implementation of updates to our technology infrastructure may result in performance
problems and may not provide the additional functionality that was expected      From time to time, we implement additions to or
changes in the hardware and software platforms we use for providing our online portals and other services. During and after the implementation of additions or changes, a platform may not perform as expected, which could result in interruptions in
operations, an increase in response time or an inability to track performance metrics. In addition, in connection with integrating acquired businesses, we may move their operations to our hardware and software platforms or make other changes, any of
which could result in interruptions in those operations. Any significant interruption in our ability to operate any of our online portals and other services could have an adverse effect on our relationships with users and clients and, as a result,
on our financial results. We rely on a combination of purchasing, licensing, internal development, and acquisitions to develop our hardware and software platforms. Our implementation of additions to or changes in these platforms may cost more than
originally expected, may take longer than originally expected, and may require more testing than originally anticipated. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that additions to or changes in these platforms will provide the additional
functionality and other benefits that were originally expected.      If the systems we use to provide online portals and other services
experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure, our business could suffer      We retain and transmit
confidential information, including personal health records, in the processing centers and other facilities we use to provide online portals and other services. It is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure and be perceived
by the marketplace as secure. A security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused
by breaches. Despite the implementation of security measures, this infrastructure or other systems that we interface with, including the Internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, hackers, improper employee or contractor
access, computer viruses, programming errors, denial-of-service attacks or other attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Because the techniques used by hackers to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems change
frequently, we may be unable to anticipate specific types of attacks or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could
be harmed and we could lose users, customers, advertisers or publishers. Any compromise of our security, whether as a result of breaches or failures of our own systems or the systems with which they interface, could reduce demand for our services
and could subject us to legal claims from our clients and users, including for breach of contract or breach of warranty.      Our online
services are dependent on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure      Our ability to deliver our online
services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it
could face outages and delays in the future. The Internet has also experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, significant growth in the number of users and the amount of traffic. If the Internet continues to experience increased usage,
the Internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it. In addition, the reliability and performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks. Any resulting interruptions in our services
or increases in response time could, if significant, result in a loss of potential or existing users of and advertisers and sponsors on our Websites and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the attractiveness of our services.  
 Customers who utilize our online services depend on Internet service providers and other Website operators for access to our Websites. Many of
these providers have experienced significant outages in the past and they could experience outages, delays and other difficulties in the future due to system failures unrelated to our systems. Any such outages or other failures on their part could
reduce traffic to our Websites.  
      51  

Table of Contents  

    Third parties may challenge the enforceability of our online agreements    
 The law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other electronic transactions is evolving. We could be subject to
claims by third parties that the online terms and conditions for use of our Websites, including disclaimers or limitations of liability, are unenforceable. A finding by a court that these terms and conditions or other online agreements are invalid
could harm our business.      We could be subject to breach of warranty or other claims by clients of our online portals and other
services if the software and systems we use to provide them contain errors or experience failures      Errors in the software and
systems we use could cause serious problems for clients of our online portals and other services. We may fail to meet contractual performance standards or client expectations. Clients of our online portals and other services may seek compensation
from us or may seek to terminate their agreements with us, withhold payments due to us, seek refunds from us of part or all of the fees charged under those agreements or initiate litigation or other dispute resolution procedures. In addition, we
could face breach of warranty or other claims by clients, or additional development costs. Our software and systems are inherently complex and, despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that they will perform as planned.  
 We attempt to limit, by contract, our liability to our clients for damages arising from our negligence, errors or mistakes. However,
contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable in certain circumstances or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages. We maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and
omissions. However, it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. Even if these claims do not
result in liability to us, investigating and defending against them would be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations. In addition, negative publicity caused by these events may delay or
hinder market acceptance of our services, including unrelated services.       
       Risks Related
to the Healthcare Industry, Healthcare Regulation and Internet Regulation       Developments in the healthcare industry that reduce
spending by healthcare industry participants generally could adversely affect our business      Our business could be adversely
impacted by changes in the structure of the healthcare industry and other changes that reduce healthcare spending. We are particularly dependent on pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies for our advertising and sponsorship
revenue. General reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:      

changes in government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare industry participants interact with patients, payers (including governmental payers) or other healthcare industry
participants, including any such regulations or initiatives that seek to control the pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products and services or that create restrictions on the advertising or promotion of healthcare products and services;

consolidation of healthcare industry participants;        

reductions in governmental funding for healthcare; and        

adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payers or providers, pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device companies or other healthcare industry participants.    
      52  

Table of Contents  

    Developments in the healthcare industry that reduce spending in the specific market
segments that we participate in could adversely affect our business      Even if overall expenditures by industry participants remain
the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market segments that we serve or are planning to serve. For example, use of our products and services could be affected by:

changes in the design of health insurance plans or governmental programs that pay for healthcare products and services;        

the timing of FDA (or European or other national regulatory authority) approvals for new products or for new approved indications or uses for existing products and any decrease in the number or significance of new drugs
or medical devices coming to market or new approved uses for existing products;        

the timing of FDA, or European or other national regulatory authority, approvals of generic products that compete with existing brand name products and any increase in the number or significance of such approvals or of
withdrawals of brand name products from the market;        

the timing of FDA (or European or other national regulatory authority) approvals of biosimilars to approved biological products and any increase in the number or significance of such approvals or of withdrawals of
biological products from the market; and        

decreases in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical or medical device companies, including as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage, restrict or prohibit advertising, sponsorship
or educational activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies or that discourage, restrict or prohibit their use of online services for some or all such activities.    
 In addition, our customers  expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes
and spending plans with respect to products and services of the types we provide. In 2016, there has been increasing scrutiny regarding pricing increases for pharmaceutical products, which could lead to additional regulation of pharmaceutical
pricing or other changes in how those products are distributed and the roles played by various industry participants in that distribution. We cannot predict the effect that such scrutiny or any resulting changes may have on the marketing plans of
our customers in future periods or their future use of our services.    The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years,
and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the markets for our products and services will continue to
exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets.  
   Government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies
     The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences.
Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us to incur additional costs and could restrict our operations. Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application
to specific products, services, and business arrangements may not be clear. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the healthcare information services that we provide. However, these laws and
regulations may nonetheless be applied to our products, services, and business arrangements. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in
adverse publicity and negatively affect our business. Even in areas where we are not subject to healthcare regulation directly, we may become involved in governmental actions or investigations through our relationships with customers that are
regulated, and participation in such actions or investigations, even if we are not a party and not the subject of an  
      53

investigation, may cause us to incur significant expenses. Some of the risks we face from healthcare regulation are as follows:  

U.S. Regulation of Drug and Medical Device Advertising and Promotion.    The WebMD Health Network  provides services involving advertising and promotion of prescription and over-the-counter
drugs and medical devices and claims of nutritional supplements. If the FDA or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) finds that any of our products and services or any information on  The WebMD Health Network , in our mobile applications, or in
 WebMD Magazine  violates applicable regulations and guidance documents, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us and/or the advertiser or sponsor of that information. State attorneys general may take similar action based on their
respective states  consumer protection statutes. Any increase or change in regulation of drug or medical device advertising and promotion, especially if it relates to promotional activities involving the Internet or social media, could make it
more difficult for us to contract for sponsorships and advertising and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. In 2014, the FDA issued multiple draft guidance documents clarifying the application of its
promotional regulations to certain content on social media Websites. In 2015, the FTC issued guidance concerning native advertising (the placement of sponsored content with the same look and feel as the publisher s independent content), which
provides recommendations for integrating sponsored content on publisher Websites while maintaining a clear distinction between the publisher s editorial content and the sponsored content. We cannot predict how our customers or others in the
industry might implement the FTC s guidance in the future or how its implementation might affect our business. Recent private industry initiatives have resulted in voluntary restrictions, which advertisers and sponsors have agreed to follow.

Non-U.S. Regulation of Drug and Medical Device Advertising and Promotion.     To the extent that  The WebMD Health Network  reaches users outside of the United States, our Websites may be
required to comply with the national laws of the respective countries whose users they address. In many countries, the advertising of prescription drugs to the general public is not allowed and, accordingly, these countries generally require access
restrictions for Websites that contain such advertisements, which are only allowed to be addressed to healthcare professionals. In addition, there are laws and regulations regarding the use of indirect or disguised marketing, and regarding the
offering and providing of gifts or benefits with promotional purpose that are not of minor value.        

Anti-Kickback Laws.     There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships and inducements to healthcare providers and patients. The federal
anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, in exchange for the referral of patients for items or services reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other
federal healthcare programs, or to induce or reward the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order of any item, good, facility or service reimbursed by these programs. Many states and European
countries also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government healthcare program. These laws are applicable to any person or entity, including manufacturers and
distributors and, therefore, may restrict how we and some of our customers market products to healthcare providers. We carefully review our practices with regulatory experts in an effort to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws. However,
the laws in this area are both broad and vague, and it is often difficult or impossible to determine precisely how the laws will be applied, particularly to new services. Penalties for violating the federal anti-kickback law include imprisonment,
fines and exclusion from participating, directly or indirectly, in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Any determination by a state, federal, or foreign regulatory agency that any of our practices violate any of these laws
could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and require us to change or terminate some portions of our business and could have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our practices could
cause us to incur significant costs or cause adverse publicity. In addition, enforcement or the potential for enforcement of these laws against some of our customers may influence the services we are able to offer and/or our customers 
willingness to continue to use our services.

False Claims Laws.     The Federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim
for payment by a Federal healthcare program. The whistleblower (or   qui tam  ) provisions of the Federal False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the Federal government alleging that the defendant has
submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. After the filing of a  qui tam  suit, the Federal government may intervene and control the case; if it does not, the private individual may pursue the
claim on his or her own. In addition, various states and European countries have enacted false claim laws analogous to the Federal False Claims Act, and many of these laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a
federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the Federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus civil penalties. In recent years an increasing
number of Federal False Claims Act cases have been brought against drug manufacturers and resulted in significant monetary settlements and imposition of federally supervised corporate integrity agreements in circumstances that include allegations
that company-sponsored continuing medical education (or CME) was unlawful off-label promotion. It is not clear whether there is a basis for the application of the Federal False Claims Act to the types of services that WebMD provides. However,
plaintiffs have in the past, and may in the future, seek to name us as defendants in these types of cases. Any action against us for violation of these laws could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and may adversely affect our ability to
operate our business. Similarly, False Claims Act actions and resulting corporate integrity agreements involving our customers may reduce the use of our services by our advertising and sponsorship clients.    

Medical Professional Regulation.     The practice of most healthcare professions requires licensing under applicable state law. In addition, the laws in some states prohibit business entities
from practicing medicine. If a state determines that some portion of our business violates these laws, it may seek to have us discontinue those portions or subject us to penalties or licensure requirements.    

Regulation of Mobile Medical Applications and Other Mobile Health Technology.     The FDA has issued guidance regarding mobile medical applications and other mobile health technology,
clarifying the agency s intent to regulate only those applications that meet the agency s definition of  device  and could pose a risk to patients  safety if they fail to work as intended. The FDA is exercising enforcement
discretion with respect to certain lower risk mobile applications that meet the device definition. Mobile applications that do not meet the device definition are beyond the FDA s jurisdiction and, accordingly, are not subject to the
agency s oversight. In February 2015, the FDA issued guidance stating it would refrain from exercising enforcement over certain products that promote health or healthy lifestyles even when promoted for patients with certain diseases or
conditions. In light of FDA guidance, we believe that none of our existing online services and mobile applications are subject to regulation as a medical device under applicable FDA regulations. We are required to determine whether FDA regulations
would apply to any of our applications and the FDA could disagree with our determination. It is also possible that products or services that we may offer in the future could subject us to such regulation or that current rules could change or be
interpreted to apply to some of our existing online services or mobile applications. Complying with such regulations could be burdensome and expensive and could delay our introduction of new services or applications.    
   The Affordable Care Act could adversely affect some of our healthcare industry customers and clients    
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we refer to as
the Affordable Care Act), was signed into law in March 2010. The Affordable Care Act made extensive changes to the system of healthcare insurance and benefits in the U.S. While we do not currently anticipate any significant adverse effects on WebMD
as a direct result of application of the Affordable Care Act to our business or on our company in its capacity as an employer, we are unable to predict what the future indirect impacts of the Affordable Care Act will be on WebMD s business
through its effects on other healthcare industry participants, including pharmaceutical and medical device companies that are advertisers and sponsors of our public portals, and employers and health plans that are clients of our  WebMD

Health Services  platform and related services. In addition, we are unable to predict the impact from any future changes to the Affordable Care Act or its implementation.  
   We may be subject to claims brought against us as a result of content we provide    
 Consumers access health-related information through our online services, including information regarding particular medical conditions and
possible adverse reactions or side effects from medications. Physicians and other healthcare professionals use our services to access clinical reference sources, commentary from leading medical experts, medical news, and coverage of professional
meetings and conferences. If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, it is possible that physicians, consumers, employees, health plan members or others may sue us for various causes of action. Although our
Websites and mobile applications contain terms and conditions, including disclaimers of liability, that are intended to reduce or eliminate our liability, the law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other electronic
transactions is evolving. We could be subject to claims by third parties that our online agreements with consumers and physicians that provide the terms and conditions for use of our Websites and mobile applications are unenforceable. A finding by a
court that these agreements are invalid and that we are subject to liability could harm our business and require costly changes to our business.  
 We have editorial procedures in place to provide quality control of the information that we publish or provide. However, we cannot assure you
that our editorial and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in particular content. Even if potential claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these
claims could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations. In addition, our business is based on establishing the reputation of our portals as trustworthy and dependable sources of healthcare
information. Allegations of impropriety or inaccuracy, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation and business.      Government
regulation of the Internet could adversely affect our business      The Internet and its associated technologies are subject to various
laws and government regulation. Our failure, or the failure of our business partners or third-party service providers, to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our products and services and the manner in which we
deliver them, or any other failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business. In addition, new laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing
laws and regulations, may be adopted with respect to online services, including in areas such as user privacy, confidentiality, consumer protection, marketing, pricing, content, copyrights and patents, and characteristics and quality of products and
services. For example, in 2015 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) altered a long-standing regulatory regime by classifying broadband Internet access services as common carrier telecommunications services. While this decision appears to most
directly impact broadband Internet service providers, FCC rulemakings are ongoing and we cannot predict how this decision or other laws or regulations will affect our business.  
 Internet and mobile user privacy, personal data security and the use of consumer information to track online activities are major issues both
in the United States and abroad. The FTC and state attorneys general continue to pay close attention to Internet privacy issues and, under their current unfair or deceptive trade practices authority, have been active in investigating and entering
into consent decrees with companies because of the online privacy and data security practices of those companies. In May 2014, the FTC held a seminar focusing on privacy issues associated with  consumer generated and controlled health
data.  The FTC s evolving privacy enforcement activities, as reflected in its workshops, reports and enforcement actions, may be relevant to services we offer. In the U.S., there is a possibility of new legislation and regulation and
increased enforcement activities relating to privacy and behavioral advertising. In addition, changes in industry practice (whether on their own or when combined with regulatory changes) could adversely impact our ability to deliver advertisements
based on online behavior. For example, it is possible that at some point in the future, it will be a common Internet practice for Websites to honor  Do Not Track  settings in Internet browsers that are turned on by default. Whether through
industry practice or in combination with government regulation, such a development could limit our ability to  
      56  

Table of Contents  

serve advertisements to consumers based on online behavior on third party sites or on our sites, which could adversely affect our revenue.  
 In Europe, Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council requires the user s full information and consent prior to
the installation and use of any so-called  cookie  on a user s computer. This Directive has been implemented differently, if at all, in member states of the European Union and national requirements to remain compliant with the
respective laws may vary. Nevertheless, the provisions of this directive, whether or not effectively implemented in national laws, are now applicable in all the member states of the European Union and enforcement actions are now being considered by
local data protection authorities. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that was granted final approval by the European Parliament in April 2016, additional requirements for users  consent for offline and online marketing will
apply. The GDPR, a European-wide regulation that will be fully enforceable by May 25, 2018, will replace and further strengthen the already very densely regulated area of Internet privacy in Europe. In addition, the GDPR and recent case law in
some European countries will increase the likelihood of applicability of European law to entities established outside the European Union but processing data of European data subjects.  
 We have privacy policies posted on our Websites that we believe comply with existing applicable laws requiring notice to users about our
information collection, use and disclosure practices. We also notify users about our information collection, use and disclosure practices relating to data we receive through offline means such as paper health risk assessments. Moreover, we take
steps to reasonably protect certain sensitive personal information we hold. We cannot assure you that the privacy policies and other statements we provide to users of our products and services, or our practices, will sufficiently protect us from
liability or adverse publicity in this area. A determination by a state or federal agency or court, or European data protection authority or competent court, that any of our practices do not meet applicable standards, or the implementation of new
standards or requirements, could adversely affect our business.      Failure to comply with laws relating to privacy and security of
personal information, including personal health information, could result in liability to us, and concerns about privacy-related issues could damage our reputation and our business    
 Privacy and security of personal information stored or transmitted electronically, including personal health information, are a major issue in
the United States and abroad. While we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, legal standards for privacy (including, but not limited to,  unfairness  and
 deception  as enforced by the FTC and state attorneys general) continue to evolve, and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in private party litigation against us or proceedings or actions against us by government
entities, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There has recently been an increase in the number of privacy-related lawsuits filed against companies. In addition, we are unable to
predict what additional legislation or regulation in the area of privacy of personal information, including personal health information, could be enacted and what effect that could have on our operations and business. Concerns about our practices
with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, could damage our reputation and harm our business.  
 The Privacy Standards and Security Standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (or HIPAA), as amended by
the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009, establish a set of national privacy and security standards for the handling of protected health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and
healthcare providers (referred to as  covered entities ) and their  business associates,  which are persons or entities that perform certain services for, or functions or activities on behalf of, a covered entity that involve the
creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of protected health information. Certain portions of our business, such as those managing employee or plan member health information for employers or health plans, are subject to HIPAA as business
associates of covered entities. In addition to imposing privacy and security requirements, HIPAA also creates obligations for  
      57  

Table of Contents  

us to report any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of protected health information, known as a breach, to our covered entity customers. The 2013 final HITECH rule modified the
breach reporting standard in a manner that made more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. In addition, HITECH and its implementing regulations imposed similar data breach notification requirements on vendors of personal health
records that require us to notify affected individuals, the FTC, and, in some cases, the media in the event of a data breach involving the unsecured personal information of users of our public portal services. Violations of HIPAA may result in civil
and criminal penalties and could damage our reputation and harm our business. HITECH increased civil penalty amounts for violations of HIPAA and significantly strengthened enforcement by requiring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and authorizing state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards that threaten the
privacy of state residents. We cannot assure you that we will adequately address the risks created by these amended HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards. In addition, we are unable to predict what changes to these Standards might be made
in the future or how those changes, or other changes in applicable laws and regulations, could affect our business.    In Europe, transfers
of EU individuals  personal data from EU member states to countries not recognized as having adequate protections for personal data, which includes the U.S., are regulated by the Directive 95/46/EC and its national implementations. On
October 6, 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the European Union s highest court, declared the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework invalid as a mechanism to legitimize transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S. On
February 3, 2016, the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a newly agreed EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which is designed to replace the Safe Harbor Framework. On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted the
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. This new framework aims at protecting the fundamental rights of anyone in the EU whose personal data is transferred to the U.S. to a Privacy-Shield certified organization. U.S. companies will be able to self-certify that they
meet the requirements of the new framework, will be required to post a privacy policy on their Websites, and will be required to reply promptly to any complaints. We are continuing to assess the need for, and form of any transfer mechanism we may
use.    Criminal sanctions in Europe for violations of national implementations of the data protection Directive 95/46/EC and of the
e-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC are rarely imposed, though national implementations provide for both criminal and administrative sanctions. For example, France provides for administrative fines of up to 3,000,000 Euros in case of illegal collection
or processing of personally identifiable information. Under the General Data Protection Regulation, there will be fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of the global sales for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or
up to 4% of the global sales for more serious offenses.      Failure to maintain CME accreditation could adversely affect Medscape
Education s ability to provide online CME offerings       Medscape Education  s continuing education activities for
physicians and other healthcare professionals are planned and implemented in accordance with the current Essential Areas and Elements and the Policies of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (or ACCME), which oversees providers
of CME credit, and other applicable accreditation standards. The ACCME s standards for commercial support of CME are intended to assure, among other things, that CME activities of ACCME-accredited providers, such as  Medscape Education ,
are independent of  commercial interests,  which are defined as entities that produce, market, re-sell or distribute healthcare goods and services, excluding certain organizations. Commercial interests and entities owned or controlled by
commercial interests are ineligible for accreditation by the ACCME.  Medscape Education  s accreditation is a Joint Accreditation from the ACCME, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (as a provider of continuing education for
pharmacy) and the American Nurses Credentialing Center (as a provider of continuing education for nurses).  
      58  

Table of Contents  

   Medscape Education  s current ACCME accreditation expires in August 2022. In order for
 Medscape Education  to renew its accreditation, it will be required to demonstrate to the ACCME that it continues to meet ACCME requirements. If  Medscape Education  fails to maintain its status as an accredited ACCME provider (whether at
the time of such renewal or at an earlier time as a result of a failure to comply with existing or additional ACCME standards), it will not be permitted to accredit CME activities for physicians and other healthcare professionals. Instead,
 Medscape Education  would be required to use third parties to provide such CME-related services. That, in turn, could discourage potential supporters from engaging  Medscape Education  to develop CME or education-related activities, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business.    CME regulations also apply in other countries. For example, under German law,
certain CME programs must be approved by the State Medical Chamber. Additionally, German CME-related services must be free of commercial/business interests and the provider of CME services must be compliant with German laws and regulations. In
France, a similar regulatory framework that restricts the organization of CME activities has been completed. These or similar restrictions in other countries may restrict our ability to carry out activities related to CME programs. Moreover, if we
are not able to demonstrate compliance with these regulations, applicable approvals may not be obtained from governmental authorities, which may impact our ability to provide CME-related services and which could have an adverse effect on our
business.      Government regulation and industry initiatives could adversely affect the volume of sponsored online CME programs
implemented through our Websites or require changes to how Medscape, LLC offers CME      CME activities may be subject to government
oversight or regulation by Congress, the FDA, HHS, and state regulatory agencies. Medscape, LLC and/or the sponsors of the CME activities that Medscape, LLC accredits may be subject to enforcement actions if any of these CME activities are deemed
improperly promotional, potentially leading to the termination of sponsorships. Medscape, LLC and/or the sponsors of the CME activities that Medscape, LLC accredits also could be affected by industry initiatives regarding funding for CME.  
 The Department of Justice continues to examine CME sponsorship by pharmaceutical companies. In addition, as part of the Affordable Care Act,
pharmaceutical companies are now required to publicly report certain payments and transfers of value that they make to U.S. physicians, including payments related to CME. Legislation has been introduced to roll back this requirement, but such
legislation has not yet been and may never be enacted. The federal government s interpretation of this reporting requirement, which has been evolving and may continue to change, could affect pharmaceutical companies  views of their
reporting obligations with respect to payments in support of authors and presenters of CME material. In implementing internal controls and procedures that promote adherence to applicable regulations and requirements, supporters of CME may interpret
the regulations and requirements differently and may implement varying procedures or requirements. These regulations and requirements, and the related internal controls and procedures:  

may discourage pharmaceutical and medical device companies from providing grants for independent educational activities;        

may slow their internal approval for such grants;        

may reduce the volume of sponsored educational programs that Medscape, LLC produces to levels that are lower than in the past, thereby reducing revenue; and    

may require Medscape, LLC to make changes to how it offers or provides educational programs, including CME.    
 In addition, future changes to laws, regulations or accreditation standards, or to the internal compliance programs of supporters or potential
supporters, may further discourage, significantly limit, or prohibit supporters or potential supporters from engaging in educational activities with Medscape, LLC, or may require Medscape, LLC to make further changes in the way it offers or provides
educational activities.

    Failure to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and
other adverse consequences      The United States and other countries have adopted anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit
directly or indirectly giving, offering or promising inducements to public officials to elicit an improper commercial advantage. Under applicable U.S., U.K., German, and most European laws, this prohibition has been interpreted to apply to doctors
and other medical professionals who work in state-run hospitals and state-run healthcare systems. Some of these laws broadly prohibit bribery in both the private and public sectors. In recent years, several global anti-corruption enforcement actions
led to significant monetary penalties against several companies operating in the global healthcare industry for providing illegal inducements to medical professionals.  
 As our business expands globally, we (and others acting on our behalf) increasingly interact with public officials, including with doctors and
other medical professionals, at least some of whom work in state-run hospitals or healthcare systems. Such interactions inherently increase the risk of violating applicable anti-corruption laws. While we have implemented compliance policies and
procedures to mitigate such risk, our personnel and others acting on our behalf could engage in conduct that violates such laws, for which we could be held responsible. Under such circumstances, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties
and other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand, financial condition and results of operations.       
       Other Risks
Applicable to Our Company and to Ownership of Our Securities       Provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may
inhibit a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our Common Stock      Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws, as well as Delaware corporate law, contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management and board of directors that holders of our common stock might consider favorable and may prevent them from
receiving a takeover premium for their shares. These provisions include, for example, our classified board structure and the authorization of our board of directors to issue up to 50 million shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote.
In addition, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that stockholders may not act by written consent and may not call special meetings. These provisions apply even if an offer to purchase our company may be considered beneficial by some
of our stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline.  
   If certain transactions occur with respect to our capital stock, limitations may be imposed on our ability to utilize net operating loss
carryforwards and tax credits to reduce our income taxes      WebMD has substantial accumulated net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards
and tax credits available to offset taxable income in future tax periods. If certain transactions occur with respect to WebMD s capital stock (including issuances, redemptions, recapitalizations, exercises of options, conversions of convertible
debt, purchases or sales by 5%-or-greater shareholders and similar transactions) that result in a cumulative change of more than 50% of the ownership of capital stock over a three-year period (as determined under rules prescribed by Section 382
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations), an annual limitation would be imposed with respect to the ability to utilize WebMD s NOL carryforwards and federal tax credits that existed at the time of the ownership
change.    In November 2008, HLTH repurchased shares of its common stock in a tender offer. The tender offer resulted in a cumulative change
of more than 50% of the ownership of HLTH s capital, as determined under rules prescribed by Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury regulations. As a result of this ownership change, there is an annual limitation imposed on the
amount of the NOL carryforwards and federal tax credits existing at the time of the ownership change that we may use to offset income in each tax year following the ownership change.  
      60  

Table of Contents  

  In September 2013 and September 2014, WebMD repurchased shares of its common stock in tender
offers (collectively, the  Tender Offers ). Completion of the Tender Offers may increase the possibility of another ownership change, which could decrease the existing annual limitation and would apply to all NOL carryforwards and tax
credits generated prior to this potential new ownership change.      We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property
and proprietary rights      Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our businesses. The steps that we take to
protect our intellectual property, proprietary information and trade secrets may prove to be inadequate and, whether or not adequate, may be expensive. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent and other intellectual property laws and
confidentiality procedures and non-disclosure contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will be able to detect potential or actual misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property,
proprietary information or trade secrets. Even if we detect misappropriation or infringement by a third party, we cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce our rights at a reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, our rights to intellectual
property, proprietary information and trade secrets may not prevent independent third-party development and commercialization of competing products or services.  
   Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing
expenses or be prevented from providing certain services      We have been, and may continue to be, subject to claims that we are
misappropriating or infringing intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others. These claims, even if not meritorious, may be expensive to defend and divert management s attention from our operations. If we become liable to third
parties for infringing these rights, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products or services that use or contain the infringing intellectual
property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing products or services or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may also be required to indemnify our customers if they become subject to third-party claims relating to
intellectual property that we license or otherwise provide to them, which could be costly.      Acquisitions, business combinations and
other transactions may be difficult to complete and, if completed, may have negative consequences for our business and our security holders    
 We may seek to acquire or to engage in business combinations with companies engaged in complementary businesses. In addition, we may enter into
joint ventures, strategic alliances or similar arrangements with third parties. These transactions may result in changes in the nature and scope of our operations and changes in our financial condition. Our success in completing these types of
transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to locate suitable candidates and negotiate mutually acceptable terms with them, and to obtain adequate financing. Significant competition for these opportunities exists, which may
increase the cost of and decrease the opportunities for these types of transactions. Financing for these transactions may come from several sources, including:      

cash and cash equivalents on hand and marketable securities;        

proceeds from the incurrence of indebtedness; and        

proceeds from the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt or of other securities.    
 The issuance of additional equity or debt securities could:      

cause substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders at the time of the issuance;        

cause substantial dilution of our earnings per share;        

subject us to the risks associated with increased leverage, including a reduction in our ability to obtain financing or an increase in the cost of any financing we obtain;    
      61  

Table of Contents  

subject us to restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities; and        

adversely affect the prevailing market price for our outstanding securities.      We do not intend
to seek security holder approval for any such acquisition or security issuance unless required by applicable law, regulation or the terms of then-existing securities.  
   Our business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or to assess the risks in particular
transactions      We have in the past acquired, and may in the future acquire, businesses, technologies, services, product lines and
other assets. The successful integration of the acquired businesses and assets into our operations, on a cost-effective basis, can be critical to our future performance. The amount and timing of the expected benefits of any acquisition, including
potential synergies between our company and the acquired business, are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those relating to:  

our ability to maintain relationships with the customers of the acquired business;        

our ability to retain or replace key personnel of the acquired business;        

potential conflicts in sponsor or advertising relationships or in relationships with strategic partners;        

our ability to coordinate organizations that are geographically diverse and may have different business cultures; and        

compliance with regulatory requirements.      We cannot guarantee that any acquired businesses
will be successfully integrated with our operations in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. Failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to achieve anticipated operating synergies, revenue enhancements or cost savings could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    Although our management attempts to evaluate
the risks inherent in each transaction and to value acquisition candidates appropriately, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain all such risks or that acquired businesses and assets will perform as we expect or enhance the value of
our company as a whole. In addition, acquired companies or businesses may have larger than expected liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification, if any, that we are able to obtain from the sellers.  
   We may not be able to raise additional funds when needed for our business or to exploit opportunities    
 Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the success of our service offerings, market
developments, and repurchases of our common stock. We may need to raise additional funds to support expansion, develop new or enhanced applications and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies or
take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. If required, we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that such financing will be
available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders.

HEALTH CORP.      395 Hudson Street   
  New York, New York 10014   
 September 16, 2016    Mr. David Schlanger  
 c/o WebMD Health Corp.    395 Hudson Street  
 New York, New York 10014    Dear David:  
 As discussed, this letter agreement (this   Agreement  ) sets forth our mutual agreement regarding the terms of your departure from WebMD Health
Corp., a Delaware corporation (the   Company  ).    1.  Termination . Your employment with the Company and its
subsidiaries and affiliates is terminated in all capacities as of September 16, 2016 (the   Departure Date  ). You hereby acknowledge that you no longer serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, or in any other officer
positions, directorships and positions that you currently hold with the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates as of the Departure Date. Except as otherwise provided under this Agreement, from and after the Departure Date, you are relieved and
shall have no further obligation to either perform any duties or responsibilities or render any services for or on behalf of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates whether under your employment agreement with the Company, dated as of
May 7, 2013, as amended (the   Employment Agreement  ) or otherwise; provided that you will reasonably assist the Company in transitioning your responsibilities, which assistance may include your participation in telephone calls
or meetings with clients and customers.    2.  Severance Benefits . Subject to your execution of this Agreement, including your
delivery and non-revocation of the Release set forth on Exhibit A (the effective date of the release is hereinafter referred to as the   Effective Date  ), the Company will provide you with the following severance payments and
benefits:    (a)  Severance . The Company will pay you as severance your base salary at the current annual rate of $525,000.00 (the
  Base Salary  ) for a period of one year commencing on the Departure Date (the   Applicable Period  ). Subject to your continued compliance with the  
      1  

Release Agreement and Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Agreement, the Base Salary will continue to be paid during the Applicable Period pursuant to the Company s normal payroll practices.
Subject to Section 11(f) below, payment of the severance shall commence on the first payroll date that occurs in the first month that begins at least 60 days after the Departure Date (but which may be accelerated by no more than 30 days) and
such first payment shall include those amounts that would have been paid if the payments had begun on the Departure Date.    (b)  2016
Bonus . Subject to your continued compliance with the Release Agreement and Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Agreement, you will receive your annual bonus in respect of 2016 as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of
Directors, in its final, binding and conclusive discretion, in accordance with the terms of the Company s 2016 annual bonus plan at the time that annual bonuses are regularly paid to other executive officers of the Company, but in no event
later than March 15, 2017.    (c)  Reimbursement for Certain Benefits . You may elect to continue your health, dental or vision
benefits after the Departure Date pursuant to the requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (  COBRA  ), whether or not you execute this Agreement. You will be notified of the right to continue
coverage under COBRA by the Company by separate letter. Should you timely elect to participate in COBRA coverage, subject to your execution of this Agreement and continued compliance with the Release Agreement and Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this
Agreement, the Company will reimburse you (which reimbursement will be treated as a taxable bonus) for that portion of the cost of your COBRA premium for the same type of coverage as you had with the Company for the Applicable Period that it would
have paid if you were an active employee, or, if earlier, until such time as you are no longer eligible for COBRA or are otherwise eligible for comparable coverage with a subsequent employer, which reimbursement shall be made within 30 days after
you provide evidence of your payment of such premiums, which evidence shall be provided no later than 30 days after payment. You shall promptly notify the Company if you become eligible for comparable coverage with another employer. The Company will
also pay you an additional tax  gross up  payment to cover all estimated applicable local, state and federal income and payroll taxes imposed on you with respect to the reimbursement described in this Section 2(c), such that, after
payment of such taxes, you will receive the full amount of the reimbursement.    (d)  Supplemental Bonus Payment . Subject to your
continued compliance with the Release Agreement and Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Agreement, you will receive payment of $210,000, less applicable withholding, reflecting the amount contributed to the 2015 Supplemental Bonus Trust. Such payment
will be made to you within ten (10) days following the Effective Date.    (e)  Company Stock Options . Pursuant to the stock
option agreements and the plan documents governing such grants, the vesting of your stock options will cease on the Departure Date and any right to exercise any vested stock options will be as set forth in the applicable stock option agreement and
plan, except as set forth below in this subparagraph. With respect to your option grants dated August 11, 2013 and March 25, 2015, subject to your continued compliance with the Release Agreement and Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this
Agreement, on the next vesting date of each such grant, you shall vest in a pro-rata portion of the number of options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (the   Common Stock  ) subject to
 
      2  

such option grants, such that you shall vest (i) on March 25, 2017 in 20,000 of the 40,000 options that would have vested on March 25, 2017, and the post-termination exercise
period in respect of those options will begin on March 25, 2017, and (ii) on August 11, 2017 in 6,250 of the 75,000 options that would have vested on August 11, 2017, and the post-termination exercise period in respect of those
options will begin on August 11, 2017. All remaining unvested options to purchase Company Common Stock held by you shall be forfeited as of the Departure Date.  
 (f)  Restricted Stock . Pursuant to the restricted stock agreements and the plan documents governing such grants, vesting of your shares
of restricted Common Stock will cease on the Departure Date, except as set forth below in this paragraph. Subject to your continued compliance with the Release Agreement and Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Agreement, a pro-rata portion of the shares
of restricted Common Stock that are scheduled to vest on March 25, 2017 (10,000 of the 20,000 restricted shares that would have vested on March 25, 2017) and August 11, 2017 (1,042 of the 12,500 restricted shares that would have
vested on August 11, 2017) shall be deemed vested on the Departure Date, provided that you may not sell, transfer or pledge such shares until the applicable scheduled vesting date and the Company will hold such shares until the applicable
scheduled vesting date. The Company will withhold from the shares of restricted Common Stock that will vest pursuant to this paragraph that amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum tax withholding obligations. All remaining unvested shares
of restricted Common Stock held by you shall be forfeited as of the Departure Date.    3.  Accrued Salary and Vacation; Expenses .  
 (a)  Accrued Salary and Vacation . All your accrued but unpaid Base Salary as of the Departure Date will be paid to you promptly in
accordance with applicable law, and your accrued but unused vacation as of the Departure Date, as reflected in the Company s time off reporting system, will be paid to you in accordance with applicable law and the Company s vacation
policy. You are entitled to these amounts (less all applicable withholding and other authorized deductions) whether or not you sign this Agreement.  
 (b)  Expense Reimbursements . You agree that, within thirty (30) days of the Departure Date, you will submit your final documented
expense reimbursement statement reflecting all business expenses you incurred through your last day of active employment, if any, for which you seek reimbursement.  
 4.  Retirement Plan . You will be entitled to receive your vested, accrued benefits under the Company s 401(k) plan in accordance
with the terms and conditions of such plan.    5.  No Other Compensation or Benefits . Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, you will not be entitled to any compensation or benefits or to participate in any past, present or future employee benefit programs or arrangements of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates on or after the Departure Date.  
 6.  Covenants and Agreements . The provisions of (i) the Trade Secret and Proprietary Information Agreement that is attached as
Annex B to the Employment Agreement, and (ii) all other agreements you have signed containing covenants regarding non-disclosure of

  Restrictions  ) shall remain in full force and effect and shall govern all periods prior to and following the Effective Date.  
 7.  Cooperation . From and after the date hereof, you will (i) cooperate in all reasonable respects (after taking into account any
employment obligations you may have) with the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and its directors, officers, attorneys and experts in connection with the conduct of any action, proceeding, investigation or litigation involving the Company, or
any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, including any such action, proceeding, investigation or litigation in which you are called to testify and (ii) promptly respond to all reasonable requests by the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates
relating to the business, including providing information concerning actual or prospective customers of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate that may be in your possession. If you receive a subpoena or other request for information, you agree
to provide the Company with prompt notice of the subpoena or request so that the Company may take appropriate action to avoid or contest disclosure. The Company shall reimburse your reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses incident to providing
such cooperation or response. Nothing contained in this Agreement (specifically including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section 7 or Section 9 of this Agreement) shall prohibit or restrict you from participating in a
governmental investigation or from providing truthful information in response to any lawfully issued subpoena, or an inquiry or investigation conducted by a governmental or regulatory agency.  
 8.  Return of Property . You will have thirty (30) days following the Departure Date to return to the Company all property of the
Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in your possession and all property made available to you in connection with your employment by the Company, including, without limitation, any and all records, manuals, customer lists, notebooks,

this Section 8, you will be entitled to retain (i) papers and other materials and correspondence of a personal nature, including, but not limited to, photographs, personal correspondence, personal diaries, personal calendars and rolodexes,
(ii) information showing your equity awards or other compensation, or relating to expense reimbursements, (iii) compensation information that you reasonably believe may be needed for your own tax purposes and (iv) copies of employee
benefit and compensation plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of the Company or any of its affiliates in which you were a participant or covered. For thirty (30) days following the Departure Date, you will continue to have access
to your Company computer, cell phone and to your Company e-mail account solely for the purposes of transitioning your personal matters conducted thereon from the Company s email account. To the extent that you access Company information during
that time period, you agree to keep all such information confidential and not to use it for any purpose whatsoever. You agree that the Company shall bear no responsibility for your personal matters related to your emails on the Company server.  
 9.  Non-disparagement . You agree to refrain from making, directly or indirectly, now or at any time in the future: (i) any
derogatory comment concerning the

that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement or the Release Agreement will result in material and irreparable injury to the Company for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it may not be possible to measure damages for
such injuries precisely and that, in the event of such a breach or threat thereof, the Company shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both, without bond or other security, restraining you
from engaging in activities prohibited by the covenants contained in this Agreement or the Release Agreement or such other relief as may be required specifically to enforce any of the covenants contained in this Agreement or the Release Agreement.

 Miscellaneous .    (a)  Entire Agreement . This Agreement, the Release Agreement, Annex B to the Employment Agreement and any
other Restrictions, the Indemnification Agreement (as defined below), and the applicable equity plans and agreements set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the matters covered hereby and supersede and
replace any express or implied prior agreement with respect to the terms of your employment and the termination thereof which you may have had with the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates (including, without limitation, the Employment
Agreement except as specifically provided in this Agreement). This Agreement may be amended only by a written document signed by the parties hereto.  
 (b)  Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction/Venue . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed for all purposes according to the
laws and public policy of the State of New York, as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York between New York residents and without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. The parties further
agree that any disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in New York, New York. The language of this Agreement shall be construed as a whole according to its fair
meaning and not strictly for or against any of the parties.  
      5  

(c)  Withholding . Any payments made or benefits provided to you under this Agreement will
be reduced by all applicable withholding taxes and other authorized deductions.    (d)  No Trust Created . This Agreement constitutes
an unfunded promise of the Company to pay the benefits provided herein and will only be paid from the general assets of the Company.    (e)
 Voluntary Assent.  You affirm that you have read this Agreement and the Release Agreement, and understand all of the terms, including the full and final release of claims set forth in the Release Agreement. You further acknowledge that you
have voluntarily entered into this Agreement and the Release Agreement; that you have not relied upon any representation or statement, written or oral, not set forth in this Agreement or the Release Agreement; that the only consideration for signing
this Agreement and the Release Agreement is as set forth herein; and that this document gives you the opportunity and encourages you to have this Agreement and the Release Agreement reviewed by your attorney and/or tax advisor.  
 (f)  Section 409A of the Co de. It is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the   Code  ), and the Treasury regulations relating thereto, or an exemption to Section 409A of the Code, and it will be considered and interpreted in accordance with that intent. Any payments
that qualify for the  separation pay  or  short-term deferral  exception or another exception under Section 409A of the Code shall be paid under the applicable exception. For purposes of the limitations of nonqualified
deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, each payment of compensation under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment of compensation. Despite any contrary provision of this Agreement, any references to
 termination of employment  or the  date of termination  (or any similar term) shall mean and refer to the date of your  separation from service,  as that term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409-A1(h). In no event may you directly or indirectly designate the calendar year of any payment under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no
liability to you or to any other person if any payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute  deferred compensation  subject to Section 409A, but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, that section. To
the extent that any reimbursements or corresponding in-kind benefits provided to you under this Agreement are determined to constitute  deferred compensation  subject to Section 409A, such amounts shall be paid or reimbursed
reasonably promptly, but not later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred, and in any event in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv). The amount of any such payments or
expense reimbursements in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses or in-kind benefits eligible for payment or reimbursement in any other calendar year, other than an arrangement providing for the reimbursement of medical expenses referred to
in Section 105(b) of the Code, and your right to such payments or reimbursement of any such expenses shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.  
      6  

(g)  Waiver . The failure of any party to this Agreement or the Release Agreement to enforce
any of the terms, provisions or covenants contained therein shall not be construed as a waiver of the same or of the right of such party to enforce the same. Waiver by any party hereto of any breach or default by another party of any term or
provision of this Agreement or the Release Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any other breach or default.    (h)
 Severability . In the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remainder of the Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby. Moreover, if any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall be held to be excessively broad as to duration, activity or subject, such provisions shall be construed by limiting and reducing them so
as to be enforceable to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law.    (i)  Descriptive Headings . The paragraph headings contained
herein and in the Release Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or the Release Agreement.  
 (j)  Notices . Any notices required or made pursuant to this Agreement or the Release Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to
have been given when delivered or mailed by United States certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, as follows: David Schlanger at the last home address in the Company s records; and

York, NY 10014    Attention: General Counsel  
 or to such other address as either party may furnish to the other in writing in accordance with this Section 11(j). Notices of change of address will be
effective only upon receipt.    (k)  Indemnification . You will be entitled to the indemnification rights and benefits set forth in
your indemnification agreement, dated as of May 7, 2013 (the   Indemnification Agreement  ).    (l)  Counterparts .
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Exhibit 99.1   
  Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   
 Item 2 of Part I (the  MD A ) of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to which this is filed as Exhibit 99.1 includes both
financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures represent earnings before interest, taxes, non-cash and other items (which we refer
to as  Adjusted EBITDA ). Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental to, and not as an alternative for net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP (referred to below as  net income ). The MD A also includes
reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.    Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management as an additional
measure of our company s performance for purposes of business decision-making, including developing budgets, managing expenditures, and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA help our
management identify additional trends in our company s financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income. In addition, we may use Adjusted EBITDA in the incentive compensation programs applicable to
some of our employees in order to evaluate our company s performance. Our management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items, particularly those items that are recurring in nature. In order to
compensate for those limitations, management also reviews the specific items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, but included in net income, as well as trends in those items. The amounts of those items are set forth, for the applicable periods,
in the reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income that accompany our press releases and disclosure documents containing non-GAAP financial measures, including the reconciliations contained in the MD A.  
 We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons
why our management finds it useful and because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions. In addition, as more fully described below, we believe that
providing Adjusted EBITDA, together with a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, helps investors make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different effective income tax rates and
tax attributes, different capitalized asset values and/or different forms of employee compensation. However, Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide a supplemental way of comparing our company with other public companies and is not intended as a
substitute for comparisons based on net income. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to
the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding GAAP measures provided by each company under applicable SEC rules.  
 The following is an explanation of the items excluded by us from Adjusted EBITDA but included in net income:  

Depreciation and Amortization  . Depreciation and amortization expense is a non-cash expense relating to capital expenditures and intangible assets arising from acquisitions that are expensed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets. We exclude depreciation and amortization expense from Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly
correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets.
Accordingly, we believe that this exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance. Investors should note that the use of tangible and intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods
presented and will contribute to future revenue generation and should also note that such expense will recur in future periods.    

Stock-Based Compensation Expense  . Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards to employees. We believe that excluding the effect of stock-based
compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons in our company s operating performance because (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to
the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Additionally,
we believe that excluding stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors in making meaningful comparisons between our company s operating performance and the operating performance of other companies that may use
different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their stock-based compensation. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating
results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future periods. Investors should also note that such expenses will recur in the future.    

Interest Income and Expense.   Interest income is associated with the level of marketable debt securities and other interest bearing accounts in which we invest, and interest expense is related to our
company s capital structure (including non-cash interest expense relating to our convertible notes). Interest income and expense varies over time due to a variety of financing transactions and due to acquisitions and divestitures that we have
entered into or may enter into in the future. We have, in the past, issued convertible debentures, repurchased shares in cash tender offers and repurchased shares and convertible debentures through other repurchase transactions, and completed the
divestiture of certain businesses. We exclude interest income and interest expense from Adjusted EBITDA (i) because these items are not directly attributable to the performance of our business operations and, accordingly, their exclusion
assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance and (ii) to assist management and investors in making comparisons to companies with different capital structures. Investors should note that
interest income and expense will recur in future periods.        

Income Tax Provision (Benefit).           We maintain a valuation allowance on a portion of our net deferred tax assets (including our net operating
loss carryforwards), the amount of which may change from quarter to quarter based on factors that are not directly related to our results for the quarter. The valuation allowance is either adjusted through the statement of operations or additional
paid-in capital. The timing of such adjustments has not been consistent and as a result, our income tax expense can fluctuate significantly from period to period in a manner not directly related to our operating performance. We exclude the income
tax provision (benefit) from Adjusted EBITDA (i) because we believe that the income tax provision (benefit) is not directly attributable to the underlying performance of our business operations and, accordingly, its exclusion assists management
and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance and (ii) to assist management and investors in making comparisons to companies with different tax attributes. Investors should note that income tax provision
(benefit) will recur in future periods.        

Other Items.   We engage in other activities and transactions that can impact our net income. In recent periods, these other items included, but were not limited to: (i) gain on investments; (ii)
settlements of litigation or claims; (iii) loss on repurchases of our convertible notes; and (iv) severance expense. We exclude these other items from Adjusted EBITDA because we believe these activities or transactions are not directly attributable
to the performance of our business operations and, accordingly, their exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance. Investors should note that some of these other items may recur in
future periods.
