NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Organization and Description of Business   

GEX Management, Inc. ( GEX ,
the  Company ,  we ,  our ,  us ) is a Professional Services Company that was originally
formed in 2004 as Group Excellence Management, LLC d/b/a MyEasyHQ. The Company converted from a limited liability company to a
corporation in March of 2016, and changed its name to GEX Management, Inc. in April of 2016. The Company provides professional
services and general business consulting to companies for a variety of their  back office  needs. We generate substantially
all of our revenue from the back office services we provide to our customers. A majority of the services we provide to our clients
include: IT support, accounting and bookkeeping, human resources, business consultation and optimization and staffing. 

Basis of Presentation   

Our financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), as well
as the applicable regulations and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that are applicable to interim financial reporting.
This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and their
accompanying notes. The actual results could differ from those estimates. 

There have been no significant
changes to our accounting policies that have a material impact on our financial statements and accompanying notes. 

The results of operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the year ending December 31,
2016 or future operations. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and
disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

The Company does not expect the adoption of
recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations, financial
position or cash flow. 

NOTE 2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

ASC Topic 820 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and requires certain disclosures
about fair value measurements. In general, fair value of financial instruments is based upon quoted market prices where available.
If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs,
observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair
value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Company s credit worthiness,
among other things, as well as unobservable parameters. 

Cash, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and other accrued expenses and other current assets and liabilities are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate
their fair values because of the relatively short maturity of those instruments. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The ASC guidance
for fair value measurements and disclosure establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

  Level 1 Inputs    Quoted
prices for identical instruments in active markets. 

  Level 2 Inputs    Quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active;
and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 

  Level 3 Inputs    Instruments
with primarily unobservable value drivers. 

 As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had no Level 3 inputs. 

NOTE 3. EARNINGS PER SHARE  

Earnings per share are
calculated in accordance with ASC 260   Earnings per Share.    The weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each period is used to compute basic earnings (loss) per share.  Diluted earnings per share are computed
using the weighted average number of shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive common shares
are additional common shares assumed to be exercised. The Company has no potentially dilutive common shares. 

NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES  

The
Company has adopted ASC 740-10,   Income Taxes  , which requires the use of the liability method in the computation
of income tax expense and the current and deferred income taxes payable (deferred tax liability) or benefit (deferred tax asset).   Valuation
allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

GEX
Management, Inc. has incurred losses since 2014.  Therefore, GEX has no federal tax liability.  The net deferred
tax asset generated by the loss carryforward has been fully reserved.  The cumulative net operating loss carryforward
is $214,313 and $147,352 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, all of which is available for carryforward
for federal income tax purposes and will expire in fiscal years 2034 to 2036.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the deferred tax asset consisted of the following: 

The Company has no tax positions at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about
the timing of such deductibility. 

The Company s tax returns for the
years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 are open for examination under Federal Statute of Limitations. 

The Company recognizes
interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.  The Company
had no accruals for interest and penalties since inception. 

NOTE 5. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY  

The Company is authorized
to issue 200,000,000 common shares at a par value of $0.001 per share. These shares have full voting rights.  At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 there were 8,000,000 common shares outstanding. 

The Company is authorized
to issue 20,000,000 preferred shares at a par value of $0.001 per share. These shares have full voting rights.  At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 there were -0- preferred shares outstanding. The preferred stock ranks senior to the common stock
of the Company in each case with respect to dividend distributions and distributions of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Company whether voluntary or involuntary. 

NOTE 6. NOTES PAYABLE  

At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 Notes Payable were as follows: 

NOTE 7. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND CONCENTRATION
OF CREDIT RISK  

At the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, three customers made up 93% and two customers made up 73% of the Company s
outstanding accounts receivable balance, respectively of which 37% and 0% were related party receivables for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

For the periods ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 four customers accounted for 87% and four customers accounted for 80% of the Company s
net revenue, respectively of which 71% and 56% were related party revenues for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 8. NOTE RECEIVABLE  

At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 the Note Receivable was as follows: 

NOTE 9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Policy on Related Party Transactions   

The Company has a formal,
written policy that includes procedures intended to ensure compliance with the related party provisions in common practice for
public companies. For purposes of the policy, a  related party transaction  is a transaction in which the Company participates
and in which a related party (including all of GEX s directors and executive officers) has a direct or indirect material
interest. Any transaction exceeding the 1% threshold, and any transaction involving consulting, financial advisory, legal or accounting
services that could impair a director s independence, must be approved by the Board of Directors. Any related party transaction
in which an executive officer or a Director has a personal interest, must be approved by the Board of Directors, following appropriate
disclosure of all material aspects of the transaction. 

Related Party Transactions    

On March 1, 2015
the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with its CEO, Carl Dorvil. Mr. Dorvil agreed to loan the Company up to $1,000,000 at
a rate of 6%. This loan has a balance of $317,187 and $107,856 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

 On March 1, 2015
the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with P413. P413 agreed to loan the Company up to $500,000 at a rate of 6%. GEX s
CEO, Carl Dorvil, is a majority member interest owner in P413. This loan has a balance of $46,000 and $0 at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 respectively. 

 On March 1, 2015

to P413. GEX s CEO, Carl Dorvil, is a majority member interest owner in P413.

The Company had revenues
from related parties of $262,385 and $339,615 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 10. GOING CONCERN  

As of the date of this
report, there is doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient
cash flows to fund our business operations and loan commitments.  Our future success and viability, therefore, are dependent
upon our ability to generate capital financing.  The failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital
may have a material and adverse effect upon the Company and our shareholders. 

NOTE 11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

In September 2016, the Company filed a
Registration Statement with the U.S. Securities   Exchange Commission on Form S-1 which, when declared effective, would allow
the Company to raise a minimum of $300,000 and a maximum of $1,500,000 at $1.50 per share. The Form S-1 was declared effective
on November 14, 2016 and since that time the Company has received subscriptions totaling $301,500. 

ITEM 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

elsewhere in this report and in our Amendment No. 2 of our Registration Statement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that characterize

Factors  included in our Amendment No. 2 of our Registration Statement. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references

statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
or the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements are often identified by the use of words such as, but not limited to,  anticipate,

date of this report and assumptions that are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult
to predict. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements. Important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in our risk factors disclosed in our Amendment No. 2 of our
Registration Statement. All information provided in this report is as of the date of this report and the Company undertakes no
duty to update this information except as required by law. 

General  

GEX Management, Inc. is
a Professional Services Company that provides services and general business consulting to companies for a variety of their  back
office  needs. We generate substantially all of our revenue from the back office services we provide to our customers. A
majority of the services we provide to our clients include: IT support, accounting and bookkeeping, human resources, business consultation
and optimization and staffing. 

Results of Operations  

The three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue  

Our revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $370,088, compared to $591,915 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to a decrease in customer
contracts. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $47,035 compared to $73,317 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

Cost of Revenues  

Cost of revenue decreased to $196,061for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $324,123 for the nine months ended September, 2015. This was primarily a result of a
decrease in contracted staff due to a decrease in customer contracts. Cost of sales was $87,833 and $66,243 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Operating Expense  

Total operating expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were $206,744 compared to the operating cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $215,304.
The decrease was due to the decrease in customer contracts, and subsequently the use of fewer contractors needed to provide various
services. Operating expenses were $91,608 and $63,852 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
increase in expenses was due to an increase in the allowance for uncollectible receivables and one-time costs related to the filing
of our Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities   Exchange Commission. 

Other Income (Expense)  

Other expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 consisted of $34,244 interest expense compared to other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisting
of $6,577 of interest expense. Other income and expense consisted solely of interest expense of $11,130 and $4,249 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in interest expense was due to the increase in loans obtained
by the Company. 

Net Income (Loss)   

Net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $66,961 compared to net income of $45,911 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net loss was $143,536
and $61,027 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The losses were due to fewer customer contracts. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company has sufficient cash and liquidity
for its operations. The Company has cash of $80,774 at September 30, 2016, due to the collections from accounts receivable. The
Company s cash and liquidity have increased subsequent to the date of the financial statements through the sale of common
stock in the Company s S-1 offering. In September 2016, the Company filed a Registration Statement with the U.S. Securities
  Exchange Commission on Form S-1 which, when declared effective, would allow the Company to raise a minimum of $300,000 and
a maximum of $1,500,000 at $1.50 per share. The Form S-1 was declared effective on November 14, 2016 and as of November 30, 2016
the Company had received subscriptions totaling $53,999. 

The accompanying financial statements are presented
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. As of the date of this quarterly report, there is doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flows to fund our business operations and loan commitments.  Our
future success and viability, therefore, are dependent upon our ability to generate capital financing.  The failure to
generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital may have a material and adverse effect upon the Company and our shareholders. 

Employees  

As of September 30, 2016, GEX had 12 full-time employees. 

Need for Additional Financing  

The Company is uncertain of its ability to
generate sufficient liquidity from its operations so the need for additional funding may be necessary.  The Company may
sell stock and/or issue additional debt to raise capital to accelerate its growth. 

ITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4: Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))
as of September 30, 2016.  This evaluation was accomplished under the supervision and with the participation of our chief
executive officer/principal executive officer, and chief financial officer/principal financial officer who concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are not effective. 

Based upon an evaluation conducted for the
period ended September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as of September 30, 2016, and as of the
date of this report, has concluded that as of the end of the periods covered by this report, we have identified the following material
weakness of our internal controls: 

Lack of sufficient accounting staff which results in a lack of segregation of duties necessary for a good system of internal control and financial statement presentation.   

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  

We have not yet made any changes in our
internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

                                         that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s
                                         fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an quarterly report) that has materially affected,
                                         or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
                                         over financial reporting; and    

  5.

over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors
(or persons performing the equivalent functions):  

a)    all
                                         significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
                                         controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                                         registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
                                         and    

b)    any
                                         fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
                                         a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
