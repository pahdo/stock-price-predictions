EXPLANATORY NOTE 
    
  As used in this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 (the  Form 10-Q/A ), the terms  Company,   our,   us  or  we  refer to Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc., a Delaware Corporation. 
    
  This Form 10-Q/A amends the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, as originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on October 29, 2015 (the  Original Filing ). This Form 10-Q/A is being filed to restate our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 and to make related corrections to certain disclosures in the Original Filing. The restatement of our financial statements in this Form 10-Q/A reflects the correction of errors primarily related to (i) error in our methodology for estimating credit loss allowance for individually acquired retail installment contracts held for investment, (ii) error related to the lack of consideration of net discount when estimating the allowance for credit losses for the non-TDR portfolio of individually acquired retail installment contracts held for investment, (iii) error in our methodology for accreting / amortizing dealer discounts, subvention payments from manufacturers, and capitalized origination costs on individually acquired retail installment contracts held for investment, (iv) error in computing the present value of expected future cash flows whereby the TDRs  weighted-average original contractual interest rate was utilized rather than the TDRs  weighted average original effective interest rate as required by U.S. GAAP and (v) error in our recognition of certain executive severance-related and stock compensation expenses and liabilities which should not have been recorded as all applicable regulatory approvals have not been obtained. The restatement also includes the correction of errors related to the income tax effects of the above errors as well as the correction of additional items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. Further explanation regarding the restatement is set forth in Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q/A. 
    
  The following sections in the Original Filing have been corrected in this Form 10-Q/A to reflect this restatement: 

Part I - Item I: Financial Information (Unaudited) 
                
    Part I - Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
                
    Part I - Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
                
    Part II - Item 1A: Risk Factors 
                
    Part II - Item 6: Exhibits 
       
  Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have also provided new certifications as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The certifications are included in this Form 10-Q/A as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2. 
    
  For the convenience of the reader, this Form 10-Q/A sets forth the information in the Original Filing in its entirety, as such information is modified and superseded where necessary to reflect the restatement. Except as provided above, this Amendment does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original Filing and does not amend or otherwise update any information in the Original Filing.

  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, predictions, forecasts, objectives, assumptions, or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as  anticipates,   believes,   can,   could,   may,   predicts,   potential,   should,   will,   estimate,   plans,   projects,   continuing,   ongoing,   expects,   intends,  and similar words or phrases. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change based on various important factors, some of which are beyond our control. For more information regarding these risks and uncertainties as well as certain additional risks that we face, refer to the Risk Factors detailed in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2014, as well as factors more fully described in Part I, Item 2,  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and elsewhere in this report, including the exhibits hereto, and subsequent reports and registration statements filed from time to time with the SEC. Among the factors that could cause our financial performance to differ materially from that suggested by the forward-looking statements are: 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and continually changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business; 
                
    adverse economic conditions in the United States and worldwide may negatively impact our results; 
                
    our business could suffer if our access to funding is reduced; 
                
    we face significant risks implementing our growth strategy, some of which are outside our control; 
                
    we may incur unexpected costs and delays in connection with exiting our personal lending business; 
                
    our agreement with Chrysler may not result in currently anticipated levels of growth and is subject to certain performance conditions that could result in termination of the agreement; 
                
    our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in developing and maintaining relationships with automobile dealerships; 
                
    our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations depend on the credit performance of our loans; 
                
    loss of our key management or other personnel, or an inability to attract such management and personnel, could negatively impact our business;  
                
    we are subject to certain bank regulations, including oversight by the OCC, the CFPB, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve, which oversight and regulation may limit certain of our activities, including the timing and amount of dividends and other limitations on our business; and 
                
    future changes in our relationship with Santander could adversely affect our operations. 
       
  If one or more of the factors affecting our forward-looking information and statements proves incorrect, its actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, forward-looking information and statements. Therefore, we caution not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking information or statements. The effect of these factors is difficult to predict. Factors other than these also could adversely affect our results, and the reader should not consider these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. New factors emerge from time to time, and management cannot assess the impact of any such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Any forward-looking statements only speak as of the date of this document, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking information or statements, whether written or oral, to reflect any change, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.

  The assets of consolidated VIEs, presented based upon the legal transfer of the underlying assets in order to reflect legal ownership, that can 
  be used only to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE and the liabilities of these entities for which creditors (or beneficial interest holders) 
  do not have recourse to our general credit were as follows: 

Certain amounts shown above are greater than the amounts shown in the corresponding line items in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets due to intercompany eliminations between the VIEs and other entities consolidated by the Company. For example, for most of its securitizations, the Company retains one or more of the lowest tranches of bonds. Rather than showing investment in bonds as an asset and the associated debt as a liability, these amounts are eliminated in consolidation as required by U.S. GAAP.

    Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies and Practices 
     Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc., a Delaware Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,  SC  or  the Company ), is the holding company for Santander Consumer USA Inc., an Illinois corporation, and subsidiaries, a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance. The Company s primary business is the indirect origination of retail installment contracts principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers. 
  In conjunction with the Chrysler Agreement, a   ten  -year private label financing agreement with Chrysler Group that became effective May 1, 2013, the Company offers a full spectrum of auto financing products and services to Chrysler customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand. These products and services include consumer retail installment contracts and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit. 
  The Company also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle retail installment contracts from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, the Company has several relationships through which it provides personal loans, private label credit cards and other consumer finance products. 
  As of   September 30, 2015  , the Company was owned approximately   59.0%   by SHUSA, a subsidiary of Santander, approximately   31.2%   by public shareholders, approximately   9.8%   by DDFS LLC, an entity affiliated with Thomas G. Dundon, the Company s former Chairman and CEO and approximately   0.1%   by other holders, primarily members of senior management. Pursuant to a Separation Agreement with Mr. Dundon, SHUSA was deemed to have delivered, as of July 3, 2015, an irrevocable notice to exercise the call option with respect to all the shares of Company common stock owned by DDFS LLC and consummate the transactions contemplated by the call option notice, subject to required bank regulatory approvals and any other approvals required by law being obtained (the "Call Transaction").  
  Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, because the Call Transaction was not consummated prior to October 15, 2015 (the  Call End Date ), DDFS is free to transfer any or all of its shares of Company common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2014, between DDFS and Santander. In the event the Call Transaction were to be completed after the Call End Date, interest would accrue on the price paid per share in the Call Transaction at the overnight LIBOR rate on the third business day preceding the consummation of the Call Transaction plus   100   basis points with respect to any shares of Company common stock ultimately sold in the Call Transaction (Note 12). 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, including certain Trusts, which are considered VIEs. The Company also consolidates other VIEs for which it was deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. Results of operations for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the entire year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2014.  
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation; specifically, retail installment contracts held for investment, personal loans, receivables from dealers, and capital lease receivables, which previously were reported as separate line items in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, now are reported  
  
   11 

in aggregate in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as finance receivables held for investment, net, with disclosure of the components in Note 3   Finance Receivables and Note 4   Leases. Additionally, related-party assets and liabilities, which previously were disclosed separately within certain line items in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, are now reported as separate line items in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The classification of related-party assets and liabilities reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014   is as follows:                   Related-Party Assets and Liabilities Classification as of 
      September 30, 2015 
      
    December 31, 2014 
      Related party taxes receivable 
      
    Federal, state and other income taxes receivable 
      Due from affiliates 
      
    Other assets 
      Notes payable   related party 
      
    Notes payable   credit facilities 
      Related party taxes payable 
      
    Federal, state and other income taxes payable 
      Due to affiliates 
      
    Accrued interest payable 

Accounts payable and accrued expenses Other liabilities 

The reclassifications in the condensed consolidated balance sheets also are reflected in the corresponding categories in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates and those differences may be material. These estimates include the determination of credit loss allowance, discount accretion, impairment, expected end-of-term lease residual values, values of repossessed assets, and income taxes. These estimates, although based on actual historical trends and modeling, may potentially show significant variances over time. 
  Business Segment Information 
  The Company has   one   reportable segment: Consumer Finance, which includes the Company s vehicle financial products and services, including retail installment contracts, vehicle leases, and dealer loans, as well as financial products and services related to motorcycles, recreational vehicles, and marine vehicles. It also includes the Company s personal loan and point-of-sale financing operations. 
  Accounting Policies 
  There have been no material changes in the Company's accounting policies from those disclosed in Part II, Item 8 -Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-11,   Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures.   The standard requires entities to account for repurchase-to-maturity transactions as secured borrowings, eliminates accounting guidance on linked repurchase financing transactions, and expands disclosure requirements related to certain transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as secured borrowings.     This guidance became effective for the Company January 1, 2015 and implementation of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Imputation of Interest  . This ASU requires that debt issuance costs, as well as discounts arising from the imputation of interest, be recorded as part of the basis of the related note, rather than as a separate asset or liability. In August 2015, the FASB and SEC further clarified their views on debt costs incurred in connection with a line of credit arrangement with ASU 2015-15. The guidance should be applied retrospectively and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2015.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-3 in its third quarter ended September 30, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to the Company s consolidated financial statements for current or previous interim and annual reporting periods. 
  
   12 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   which provides guidance on a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The effective date for this ASU, which was deferred by ASU 2015-14 issued in August 2015, is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, the Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12,   Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.   This standard affects entities that issue share-based payments when the terms of an award stipulate that a performance target could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01,   Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items.   This standard simplifies income statement classification by removing the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP, and as a result, items that are both unusual and infrequent no longer will be separately reported net of tax after continuing operations. This guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   This ASU changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. This guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impacts of the adoption of this ASU.  

2.  
    Corrections of Errors 
     Subsequent to the issuance of the Company's September 30, 2015 condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company identified errors in its historical financial statements, including for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. Accordingly, the Company has restated the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 to reflect the error corrections, the most significant of which are as follows: 
              
    The Company determined that its historical methodology for estimating its credit loss allowance for individually acquired retail installment contracts held for investment was in error as it did not estimate impairment on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) separately from a general credit loss allowance on loans not classified as TDRs, and incorrectly applied a loss emergence period to the entire portfolio rather than only to loans not classified as TDRs. In addition, the Company determined that it had incorrectly identified the population of loans that should be classified and disclosed as TDRs, and, separately, had incorrectly estimated the impairment on these loans, as of each balance sheet dates. The Company has corrected its allowance methodology accordingly, and has determined, based on this corrected methodology, the the credit loss allowance reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was overstated by   $82,692   and   $56,508  , respectively.  
                
    The Company determined that subvention payments related to leased vehicles were incorrectly classified, within the income statement, as an addition to Leased vehicle income rather than a reduction of Leased vehicle expense. The subvention payments classification errors did not impact net income for any period. 
     The impact of the corrections of the above errors on the financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 was disclosed in Part II, Item 9B of the Original 10-K. 
           II.  
    Errors identified subsequent to the filing of the Original 10-K: 
                
    The Company previously used the loans  original contractual interest rate rather than the original effective rate as the discount rate applied to expected cash flows to determine TDR impairment. ASC 310-40-35-12 requires that expected future cash flows be discounted using the original effective interest rate.  
     
   13 

The Company has corrected the discount rate used in the determination of TDR impairment and has determined that the allowance was understated, and the net carrying balance of individually acquired retail installment contracts held for investment accordingly overstated, by   $71,486   and   $68,642   as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, related to this methodology error. This error also caused the provision for credit losses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income to be overstated by   $1,835   and understated by   $5,384   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and understated by   $2,844   and   $8,789   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
             
    The Company has determined that its application of the retrospective effective interest method for accreting discounts, subvention payments from manufacturers, and other origination costs (collectively "discount") on individually acquired retail installment contracts held for investment was in error, as (i) these cost basis adjustments were accreted over the average life of a loan rather than the aggregate life of a loan pool, (ii) defaults were inappropriately considered in the estimate of future principal prepayments, (iii) the portfolio was not adequately segmented to consider different prepayment performance based on credit quality and term, (iv) remaining unaccreted balances at charge off were being recorded as interest income rather than as reductions of the net charge off  ,   and (v) the unaccreted discount component of TDR carrying value was misstated, resulting in inaccurate TDR impairment.  
       
  (i)   T  he Company previously had accreted discounts over the average life of the loan portfolio. However, Examples 3 and 4 in the implementation guidance to ASC 310-20,   Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs  , provide guidance on the projection of cash flows for a pool of loans and the treatment of actual and anticipated prepayments for determining the effective interest rate under the retrospective method. The guidance demonstrates an application that aligns with the aggregate life of the loan pool rather than the average loan life concept. Under the average life method previously applied by the Company, anticipated prepayments shortened the life of the portfolio and maintained the portfolio monthly cash flows constant, i.e., incorrectly accelerated the accretion of discount. Accordingly, management has determined that the use of the average life was in error. 
    
  (ii) The Company previously had considered all types of liquidations, both voluntary prepayments and charge offs, as anticipated prepayments for purposes of determining a prepayment assumption. However, the application of a prepayment assumption as described in ASC 310-20-35-26 does not allow for future expected defaults to be considered in the assumption. Accordingly, management has determined that the inclusion of future expected defaults in the anticipated prepayment assumption was in error. 
    
  (iii) The Company previously had aggregated all loans in the individually acquired retail installment contract portfolio into one pool for the purpose of estimating prepayments and determining the effective interest rate under the retrospective method. ASC 310-20-35-30 provides some characteristics to be considered when aggregating a large number of similar loans for this purpose. Management has determined that there is differentiation in prepayment behavior within its loan portfolio based on characteristics including credit quality, maturity, and period of origination. Accordingly, management has determined that the absence of segmentation into pools of homogeneous loans was in error. 
    
  (iv) The Company previously had recorded charge offs based on unpaid principal balance. The accretion of discount of charged off loans was previously reported as interest income. However, ASC 310-10,   Receivables  , refers to the recorded investment in the loan as the appropriate accounting basis. ASC 310-10-35-24 specifies that the recorded investment includes adjustments such as unamortized premium or discount. Accordingly, management has determined that unaccreted discounts remaining at charge off should be included in the net charge off amount recorded. 
    
  (v) As a result of the incorrect accretion methodology, as well as the exclusion of unaccreted discount, the recorded investment in TDRs was misstated, resulting in a misstatement of TDR impairment. 
  
   14 

The Company has corrected its accretion methodology and has determined that the various aspects had the following impacts as of each period end balance sheet date:   

  This   error also had the following impacts on the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income:   

The Company previously omitted the consideration of net unaccreted discounts when estimating the allowance for credit losses for the non-TDR portfolio of individually acquired retail installment loans held for investment under ASC 450-20. Accordingly, management has determined that the omission of consideration of net unaccreted discounts in the allowance was in error. 
     The Company has corrected its allowance methodology to take net unaccreted discounts into consideration, and has determined that the allowance was overstated, and the net carrying balance of individually acquired retail installment contracts held for investment accordingly understated, by   $100,695   and   $95,465     as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, related to this methodology error. This error also caused the provision for credit losses in the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income to be overstated by   $868   and   $1,001   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and   $5,230   and   $23,412   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
             
    During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had recognized   $12,340   in severance-related expenses,   $9,881   in stock compensation expense and a liability for   $115,139   in contemplation of the amounts and benefits payable to former CEO Thomas G. Dundon pursuant to a Separation Agreement among Mr. Dundon, the Company, DDFS LLC, SHUSA and Santander. However, the Company has subsequently determined that its previous accounting for the expenses and liabilities contemplated in the Separation Agreement was in error as such expenses and liabilities should not be recorded until all applicable conditions have been satisfied, including that all regulatory approvals have been obtained. Accordingly, the accompanying restated consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 do not include any expense or liability associated with the Separation Agreement. Further, in the absence of satisfaction of applicable conditions, Mr. Dundon s remaining unexercised vested options are considered to have expired subsequent to his termination without cause; accordingly, the restated financial statements reflect the removal of the deferred tax asset associated with the previously recorded compensation expense related to Mr. Dundon s vested but unexercised options, and do not include Mr. Dundon s vested options in the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 
     In addition to the restatement of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements, certain information within the following notes to the condensed consolidated financial statement has been restated to reflect the corrections of errors discussed above as well as other, less significant errors and/or to add disclosure language, as appropriate.

3. 
    Finance Receivables (As Restated) 
     Finance receivables held for investment includes individually acquired retail installment contracts and loans, purchased receivables portfolios, capital leases (Note 4) and, prior to September 30, 2015, personal loans. The Company's portfolio of individually acquired retail installment contracts and loans held for investment was comprised of the following at   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  : 

(a)    As of   September 30, 2015   all of the Company's personal loans were classified as held for sale. 

Purchased receivables portfolios, which were acquired with deteriorated credit quality, were comprised of the following at   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  : 
  
   21 

As of   September 30, 2015  , the Company determined that it no longer had the intent to hold its personal loans for investment and that classification of all personal loans as held for sale was appropriate as of that date. In connection with the reclassification to held for sale, the Company adjusted the credit loss allowance associated with the personal loan portfolio to reflect the valuation of the portfolio at the lower of cost or market through provision for credit losses, and the adjusted credit loss allowance was released through provision for credit losses. The net impact of the reclassification of the personal loan portfolio to held for sale was a decrease to provision expense of   $13,999  . Future loan originations and purchases under the Company s personal lending platform will also be classified as held for sale. As of   September 30, 2015  , personal loans held for sale totaled   $1,884,191  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2015  , retail installment contracts held for sale and receivables from dealers held for sale totaled   $825,452   and   zero  , respectively. As of   December 31, 2014  , retail installment contracts and receivables from dealers held for sale totaled   $45,425   and   $1,161  , respectively. Sales of retail installment contracts for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   included principal balance amounts of   $3,057,654   and   $5,993,407  , respectively. Sales of retail installment contracts for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   included principal balance amounts of   $2,413,251   and   $5,483,149  , respectively. The Company retains servicing of sold retail installment contracts and was servicing   $10,490,844   and   $7,372,884   as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively, of contracts sold to unrelated third parties. Proceeds from sales of charged-off assets for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   $13,730   and   $117,693  , respectively. Proceeds from sales of charged-off assets for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   were   $24,987   and   $26,674  , respectively. 
  Retail installment contracts are collateralized by vehicle titles, and the Company has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. Most of the Company s retail installment contracts held for investment are pledged against warehouse facilities or securitization bonds (Note 6). Most of the creditors on the Company s retail installment contracts are retail consumers; however,   $1,058,560   and   $816,100   of the unpaid principal balance represented fleet contracts with commercial borrowers as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. 
  Borrowers on the Company s retail installment contracts held for investment are located in Texas (  17%  ), Florida (  13%  ), California (  10%  ), Georgia (  5%  ) and other states each individually representing less than   5%   of the Company s total.    
  Receivables from dealers held for investment includes a term loan with a third-party vehicle dealer and lender that operates in multiple states. The loan allowed committed borrowings of   $50,000   at   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , and the unpaid principal balance of the facility was   $50,000   at each of those dates. The term loan will mature on December 31, 2018. 
  The remaining receivables from dealers held for investment are all Chrysler-related. Borrowers on these Chrysler dealer receivables are located in Virginia (  40%  ), California (  24%  ), New York (  19%  ), Mississippi (  8%  ), Missouri (  7%  ) and other states each individually representing less than   5%   of the Company s total. 
  Borrowers on the Company s personal loans are located in California (  11%  ), Texas (  8%  ), New York (  8%  ), Florida (  7%  ), and other states each individually representing less than   5%   of the Company s total.  
  
   22 

Changes in accretable yield on the Company s purchased receivables portfolios for the periods indicated were as follows:   

  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company did not acquire any vehicle loan portfolios for which it was probable at acquisition that not all contractually required payments would be collected. 

4. 
    Leases (As Restated) 
     The Company has both operating and capital leases, which are separately accounted for and recorded on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Operating leases are reported as leased vehicles, net, while capital leases are included in finance receivables held for investment, net. 
  Operating Leases 
  Leased vehicles, net, which is comprised of leases originated under the Chrysler Agreement, consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  : 

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company executed bulk sales of Chrysler Capital leases with an aggregate depreciated net capitalized cost of   zero   and   $1,316,958  , respectively, and a net book value of   zero   and   $1,155,171  , respectively, to a third party. The bulk sales agreements included certain provisions whereby the Company agreed to share in residual losses for lease terminations with losses over a specific percentage threshold (Note 11). The Company retained servicing on the sold leases. Due to the accelerated depreciation permitted for tax purposes, these sales generated large taxable gains that the Company will defer through a qualified like-kind exchange program. In order to qualify for this deferral, the proceeds from the sales (along with the proceeds from recent lease terminations for which the Company also intends to defer the taxable gain) are held in a qualified exchange account, which is classified as restricted cash, until reinvested in new lease originations. Any taxable gains that do not qualify for deferral will be recognized upon expiration of the reinvestment period.

  Capital Leases 
  
   23 

Certain leases originated by the Company are accounted for as capital leases, as the contractual residual values are nominal amounts. Capital lease receivables, net consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  :

    Credit Loss Allowance and Credit Quality (As Restated) 
     Credit Loss Allowance 
  The Company estimates credit losses on individually acquired retail installment contracts and personal loans held for investment based on delinquency status, historical loss experience, estimated values of underlying collateral, when applicable, and various economic factors. The Company maintains a general credit loss allowance for receivables from dealers based on risk ratings, and individually evaluates the loans for specific impairment as necessary. The credit loss allowance for receivables from dealers is comprised entirely of general allowances as none of these receivables have been determined to be individually impaired.  
  The activity in the credit loss allowance for individually acquired loans for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   was as follows: 

24 

(a)    As of   September 30, 2015   all of the Company's personal loans were classified as held for sale. 
           (b) 
    Charge-offs of retail installment contracts acquired individually include lower of cost or market adjustments of   $64,140   and   $73,388   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Charge-offs of personal loans include lower of cost or market adjustments of   $377,598   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which were charged off against the credit loss allowance. 
       
  The impairment activity related to purchased receivables portfolios for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   was as follows: 

The Company estimates lease losses on the capital lease receivable portfolio based on delinquency status, loss experience to date, and consideration of similarity between this portfolio and individually acquired retail installment contracts as well as various economic factors. The activity in the lease loss allowance for capital leases for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   was as follows: 

Delinquencies 
    
  Retail installment contracts and personal amortizing term loans are classified as non-performing when they are greater than   60 days   past due as to contractual principal or interest payments. Dealer receivables are classified as non-performing when they are greater than   90 days   past due. At the time a loan is placed in non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. If an account is returned to a performing status, the Company returns to accruing interest on the contract. The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off. A summary of delinquencies as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014   is as follows: 
  
   25 

(a) 
    As of   September 30, 2015   all of the Company's personal loans were classified as held for sale.  
       
  The balances in the above tables reflect total unpaid principal rather than net investment before allowance; the difference is considered insignificant. As of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , there were   no   receivables from dealers or retail installment contracts held for sale that were 31 days or more delinquent. Delinquencies on the capital lease portfolio, which began in 2014, were immaterial as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  .  
  FICO          Distribution     A summary of the credit risk profile of the Company s consumer loans by FICO        distribution, determined at origination, as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014   was as follows: 

(b) 
    Unpaid principal balance excluded from the FICO        distribution is an insignificant amount of loans to borrowers that did not have FICO scores at origination. 
              (c) 
    As of   September 30, 2015   all of the Company's personal loans were classified as held for sale. 
       
  Commercial Lending Credit Quality Indicators     The credit quality of receivables from dealers, which are considered commercial loans, is summarized according to standard regulatory classifications as follows: 
  Pass   Asset is well-protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or guarantors, if any, or by the fair value less costs to acquire and sell any underlying collateral in a timely manner. 
  
   26 

Special Mention   Asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention, which, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for an asset at some future date. Special Mention assets are not adversely classified. 
  Substandard   Asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. A well-defined weakness or weaknesses exist that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. The loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. 
  Doubtful   Exhibits the inherent weaknesses of a substandard credit. Additional characteristics exist that make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values. Possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the credit, an estimated loss cannot yet be determined. 
  Loss   Credit is considered uncollectible and of such little value that it does not warrant consideration as an active asset. There may be some recovery or salvage value, but there is doubt as to whether, how much or when the recovery would occur. 
  As discussed in Note 3, the Company has   $1,058,560   of fleet retail installment contracts with commercial borrowers. The Company's risk department performs a commercial analysis and classifies certain loans over an internal threshold based on the classifications above. As of   September 30, 2015  ,   $2,986   of fleet loans were classified as Special Mention; the remaining fleet portfolio borrowers with balances over the classification threshold all were classified as Pass. 
  Commercial loan credit quality indicators for receivables from dealers held for investment as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014   were as follows: 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  In certain circumstances, the Company modifies the terms of its finance receivables to troubled borrowers. Modifications may include a reduction in interest rate, an extension of the maturity date, rescheduling of future cash flows, or a combination thereof. A modification of finance receivable terms is considered a TDR if the Company grants a concession to a borrower for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties that would not otherwise have been considered. Management considers TDRs to include all individually acquired retail installment contracts that have been modified at least once, deferred for a period of   90 days   or more, or deferred at least twice. Additionally, restructurings through bankruptcy proceedings are deemed to be TDRs. For personal loans, restructurings due to credit counseling or hardship also are considered TDRs. The purchased receivables portfolio and operating and capital leases are excluded from the scope of the applicable guidance. As of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , there were   no   receivables from dealers classified as a TDR. 
  
   27 

The table below presents the Company s TDRs as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  : 

A summary of the Company s delinquent TDRs at   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , is as follows: 

A loan that has been classified as a TDR remains so until the loan is liquidated through payoff or charge-off. Consistent with other of the Company s retail installment contracts, TDRs are placed on nonaccrual status when the account becomes past due more than   60 days  , and returns to accrual status when the account is   60 days   or less past due. Average recorded investment and income recognized on TDR loans are as follows: 

The following table summarizes the financial effects of TDRs that occurred during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  : 

28 

A TDR is considered to have subsequently defaulted upon charge off, which for retail installment contracts is at the earlier of the date of repossession or   120 days   past due and for revolving personal loans is generally the month in which the receivable becomes   180 days   past due. Loan restructurings accounted for as TDRs within the previous twelve months that subsequently defaulted during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   are summarized in the following table: 

The following table summarizes the cumulative changes of the TDR balance, and its components, for retail installment contracts during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  : 

29 

Revolving Credit Facilities 
  The following table presents information regarding credit facilities as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  : 

(a) 
    Half of the outstanding balance on this facility matures in March 2016 and half matures in March 2017.  
              (b) 
    This line is held exclusively for financing of Chrysler loans. 
              (c) 
    This line is held exclusively for financing of Chrysler leases. 
              (d) 
    In December 2016,   $500,000   of the total revolving commitment under this warehouse line will expire, at which time any utilized balance attributable that portion of the commitment will become an amortizing obligation; the remainder of the commitment of   $2,000,000   matures in June 2017. 
              (e) 
    This line is held exclusively for personal term loans. On October 26, 2015, the maturity date for this warehouse line commitment was extended to November 9, 2015. 
              (f) 
    The repurchase facility is collateralized by securitization notes payable retained by the Company. This facility has rolling   30  -day and   90  -day maturities.  
              (g) 
    These lines are collateralized by residuals retained by the Company. 
      
   30 

Facilities with Third Parties 
  The warehouse lines and repurchase facility are fully collateralized by a designated portion of the Company s retail installment contracts (Note 3), leased vehicles (Note 4), securitization notes payables and residuals retained by the Company.  
  Lines of Credit with Santander and Related Subsidiaries 
  Through its New York branch, Santander provides the Company with   $4,500,000   of long-term committed revolving credit facilities. Through SHUSA, under an agreement entered into on March 6, 2014, Santander provides the Company with an additional   $300,000   of committed revolving credit, collateralized by residuals retained on its own securitizations. 
    
  The facilities offered through the New York branch are structured as   three  - and   five  -year floating rate facilities, with current maturity dates of   December 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2018  , respectively. Santander has the option to continue to renew the term of these facilities annually going forward, thereby maintaining the   three  - and   five  -year maturities. These facilities currently permit unsecured borrowing but generally are collateralized by retail installment contracts and retained residuals. Any secured balances outstanding under the facilities at the time of their maturity will amortize to match the maturities and expected cash flows of the corresponding collateral. 
    
  Secured Structured Financings 
    
  The following table presents information regarding secured structured financings as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  : 
  
   31 

(a) 
    Securitizations executed under Rule 144A of the Securities Act are included within this balance. 
              (b) 
    This securitization was most recently amended in May 2015 to extend the maturity date to May 2016. 

(a) 
    Securitizations executed under Rule 144A of the Securities Act are included within this balance. 
       
  Most of the Company s secured structured financings are in the form of public, SEC-registered securitizations. The Company also executes private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and periodically issues private term amortizing notes, which are structured similarly to securitizations but are acquired by banks and conduits. The  
  
   32 

Company s securitizations and private issuances are collateralized by vehicle retail installment contracts and loans or leases. 
  Unamortized debt issuance costs are amortized as interest expense over the terms of the related notes payable using a method that approximates the effective interest method. For securitizations, the term takes into consideration the expected execution of the contractual call option, if applicable. Amortization of premium or accretion of discount on acquired notes payable is also included in interest expense using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the estimated remaining life of the acquired notes. Total interest expense on secured structured financings for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   was   $76,787   and   $60,700  , respectively. Total interest expense on secured structured financings for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   was   $207,967   and   $177,779  , respectively. 

7. 
    Variable Interest Entities (As Restated) 
     The Company transfers retail installment contracts and leased vehicles into newly formed Trusts that then issue one or more classes of notes payable backed by the collateral. The Company s continuing involvement with these Trusts is in the form of servicing the assets and, generally, through holding residual interests in the Trusts. These transactions are structured without recourse. The Trusts are considered VIEs under U.S. GAAP and, when the Company holds the residual interest, are consolidated because the Company has: (a) power over the significant activities of each entity as servicer of its financial assets and (b) through the residual interest and in some cases debt securities held by the Company, an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from each VIE that are potentially significant to the VIE. When the Company does not retain any debt or equity interests in its securitizations or subsequently sells such interests it records these transactions as sales of the associated retail installment contracts. 
  Revolving credit facilities generally also utilize Trusts that are considered VIEs. The collateral, borrowings under credit facilities and securitization notes payable of the Company's consolidated VIEs remain on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes finance charges and fee income on the retail installment contracts and leased vehicles and interest expense on the debt, and records a provision for credit losses to cover probable inherent losses on the contracts. All of the Trusts are separate legal entities and the collateral and other assets held by these subsidiaries are legally owned by them and are not available to other creditors. 
  The Company also uses a titling trust to originate and hold its leased vehicles and the associated leases, in order to facilitate the pledging of leases to financing facilities or the sale of leases to other parties without incurring the costs and administrative burden of retitling the leased vehicles. This titling trust is considered a VIE. 
  On-balance sheet variable interest entities 
  The Company retains servicing for receivables transferred to the Trusts and receives a monthly servicing fee on the outstanding principal balance. Supplemental fees, such as late charges, for servicing the receivables are reflected in fees, commissions and other income. As of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the Company was servicing   $27,767,242   and   $24,611,624  , respectively, of gross retail installment contracts that have been transferred to consolidated Trusts. The remainder of the Company s retail installment contracts remain unpledged.  
    
  A summary of the cash flows received from consolidated securitization trusts during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , is as follows: 

(a) 
    Includes additional advances on existing securitizations. 
              (b) 
    These amounts are not reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows because the cash flows are between the VIEs and other entities included in the consolidation. 
     
   33 

Off-balance sheet variable interest entities 
  The Company has completed sales to VIEs that met sale accounting treatment in accordance with the applicable guidance. Due to the nature, purpose, and activity of the transactions, the Company determined for consolidation purposes that it either does not hold potentially significant variable interests or is not the primary beneficiary as a result of the Company's limited further involvement with the financial assets. For such transactions, the transferred financial assets are removed from the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. In certain situations, the Company remains the servicer of the financial assets and receives servicing fees that represent adequate compensation. The Company also recognizes a gain or loss for the difference between the cash proceeds and carrying value of the assets sold.  
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company sold   zero   and   $768,561   of gross retail installment contracts to a VIE in an off-balance sheet securitization. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2014  , the Company sold   $1,028,278   and   $1,802,461   of gross retail installment contracts to a VIE in an off-balance sheet securitization, respectively. As of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the Company was servicing   $2,157,189   and   $2,157,808  , respectively, of gross retail installment contracts that have been sold in these and other off-balance sheet Chrysler Capital securitizations. Other than repurchases of sold assets due to standard representations and warranties, the Company has   no   exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these VIEs. 
    
  A summary of the cash flows received from these off-balance sheet securitization trusts during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   is as follows: 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company settled transactions to sell residual interests in certain Trusts and certain retained bonds in those Trusts to an unrelated third party. The Company received cash proceeds of   $661,675   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   related to the sale of these residual interests and retained bonds. The Company retained an investment in the notes issued by one of these Trusts with a carrying value of   $5,577  , which also approximated fair value on the date of settlement.  
    
  Each of these Trusts was previously determined to be a VIE. Prior to the sale of these residual interests, the associated Trusts were consolidated by the Company because the Company held a variable interest in each VIE and had determined that it was the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Although the Company will continue to service the loans in the associated Trusts and, therefore, will have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust, the Company concluded that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of the Trusts upon the sale of the Company's residual interests. As a result, the Company deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of the corresponding trusts upon their sale. 
    
  Upon settlement of these transactions in the   third   quarter of   2015  , the Company derecognized   $1,919,171   in assets and   $1,183,792   in notes payable and other liabilities of the trust. The sale of these interests resulted in a net decrease to     provision for credit losses of   $38,260  , after giving effect to lower of cost or market adjustments. 
    
  Since deconsolidation during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company received cash for servicing fees from the related trusts of   $5,922  . 

8. 
    Derivative Financial Instruments (As Restated) 
     The Company manages its exposure to changing interest rates using derivative financial instruments. In certain circumstances, the Company is required to hedge its interest rate risk on its secured structured financings and the borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. The Company uses both interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to satisfy these requirements and to hedge the variability of cash flows on securities issued by securitization Trusts and borrowings under the Company's warehouse lines of credit. Certain of the Company s interest rate swap agreements  
  
   34 

are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective, and amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings as the forecasted transactions impact earnings. Ineffectiveness, if any, associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. 
  The Company s remaining interest rate swap agreements, as well as its interest rate cap agreements, the corresponding options written in order to offset the interest rate cap agreements, a total return swap and a total return settlement agreement, are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are reflected in earnings as a component of interest expense. 
  The underlying notional amounts and aggregate fair values of these agreements at   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , were as follows: 

See Note 14 for additional disclosure of fair value and balance sheet location of the Company's derivative financial instruments. 
  In March 2014, the Company entered into a financing arrangement with a third party whereby the Company pledged certain bonds retained in its own securitizations in exchange for   $250,594   in cash. In conjunction with the financing arrangement, the Company entered into a total return swap related to the bonds as an effective avenue to monetize the Company s retained bonds as a source of financing. This arrangement matured and was terminated in May 2015. 
    
  The Company is the holder of a warrant that gives it the right, if certain vesting conditions are satisfied, to purchase additional shares in a company in which it has a cost method investment. This warrant was issued in 2012 and is carried at its estimated fair value of   zero   at   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  . 
  The Company is obligated to make purchase price holdback payments on a periodic basis to a third-party originator of loans that the Company has purchased, when losses are lower than originally expected. The Company also is obligated to make total return settlement payments to this third-party originator in 2016 and 2017 if returns on the purchased loans are greater than originally expected. These purchase price holdback payments and total return settlement payments are considered to be derivatives, collectively referred to herein as  total return settlement,  and accordingly are marked to fair value each reporting period. 
  The Company enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting netting of transactions, such as derivatives and collateral posting, with the same counterparty on the occurrence of certain events. A master netting agreement allows two counterparties the ability to net-settle amounts under all contracts, including any related collateral posted, through a single payment. The right to offset and certain terms regarding the collateral process, such as valuation, credit events and settlement, are contained in ISDA master agreements. 
  Information on the offsetting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities due to the right of offset was as follows, as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  :

The gross gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income, and gains (losses) recognized in net income, are included as components of interest expense. The impacts on the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   were as follows:

    Other Assets (As Restated) 
     Other assets were comprised as follows: 

38 

(a) 
    These amounts relate to the Chrysler Agreement. The Company paid a   $150,000   upfront fee upon the May 2013 inception of the agreement. The fee is being amortized into finance and other interest income over a   ten  -year term. As the preferred financing provider for Chrysler, the Company is entitled to subvention payments on loans and leases with below-market customer payments. 
              (b) 
    Includes vehicles obtained through repossession as well as vehicles obtained due to lease terminations.

10. 
    Income Taxes (As Restated) 
     The Company recorded income tax expense of   $136,539   (  36.6%   effective tax rate) and   $467,816   (  35.7%   effective tax rate) during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The Company recorded income tax expense of   $98,562   (  35.5%   effective tax rate) and   $322,367   (  36.0%   effective tax rate) during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2014  , respectively. The increase in effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   is primarily due to favorable permanent book to tax differences recognized during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2014  .  
  The Company is a party to a tax sharing agreement requiring that the unitary state tax liability among affiliates included in unitary state tax returns be allocated using the hypothetical separate company tax calculation method. At   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the Company had a net receivable from (payable to) affiliates under the tax sharing agreement of (  $396  ) and   $467  , respectively, which was included in related party taxes payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  Significant judgment is required in evaluating and reserving for uncertain tax positions. Although management believes adequate reserves have been established for all uncertain tax positions, the final outcomes of these matters may differ. Management does not believe the outcome of any uncertain tax position, individually or combined, will have a material effect on the results of operations. The reserve for uncertain tax positions, as well as associated penalties and interest, is a component of the income tax provision. 

11. 
    Commitments and Contingencies (As Restated) 
     The Company is obligated to make purchase price holdback payments to a third-party originator of loans that it purchases on a periodic basis, when losses are lower than originally expected. The Company also is obligated to make total return settlement payments to this third-party originator in 2016 and 2017 if returns on the purchased loans are greater than originally expected. These obligations are accounted for as derivatives (Note 8). 
  The Company has extended revolving lines of credit to certain auto dealers. Under this arrangement, the Company is committed to lend up to each dealer's established credit limit. 
  Under terms of agreements with a peer-to-peer personal lending platform company, the Company was committed as of   September 30, 2015   to purchase at least the lesser of   $30,000   per month or   50%   of the lending platform company s "near-prime" (as that term is defined in the agreements) originations thereafter through July 2017. This commitment could be reduced or canceled with   90 days    notice. On October 9, 2015, the Company sent a notice of termination to the lending platform company (Note 17). 
  The Company committed to purchase certain new advances on personal revolving financings originated by a third party retailer, along with existing balances on accounts with new advances, for an initial term ending in   April 2020   and renewing through April 2022 at the retailer's option. Each customer account generated under the agreements generally is approved with a credit limit higher than the amount of the initial purchase, with each subsequent purchase automatically approved as long as it does not cause the account to exceed its limit and the customer is in good standing. As these credit lines do not have a specified maturity, but rather can be terminated at any time in the event of adverse credit changes or lack of use, the Company has not recorded an allowance for unfunded commitments. As of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the Company was obligated to purchase   $15,681   and   $7,706  , respectively, in receivables that had been originated by the retailer but not yet purchased by the Company. The Company also is required to make a profit-sharing payment to the retailer each month if performance exceeds a specified return threshold. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company and the third-party retailer executed an amendment that, among other provisions, increases the profit-sharing percentage retained by the Company, gives the retailer the right to repurchase up to   9.99%   of the existing portfolio at any time during the term of the agreement, and, provided that repurchase right is exercised, gives the retailer the right to retain up to   20%   of new accounts subsequently originated. 
  Under terms of an application transfer agreement with an OEM, the Company has the first opportunity to review for its own portfolio any credit applications turned down by the OEM's captive finance company. The agreement does not require the Company to originate any loans, but for each loan originated the Company will pay the OEM a referral fee, comprised of a volume bonus fee and a loss betterment bonus fee. The loss betterment bonus fee will be calculated annually and is based on the amount by which losses on loans originated under the agreement are lower than an established percentage threshold.

The Company has agreements with SBNA to service recreational and marine vehicle portfolios. These agreements call for a periodic retroactive adjustment, based on cumulative return performance, of the servicing fee to inception of the contract. There were downward     adjustments of   $904   and   $1,051   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

  In connection with the sale of retail installment contracts through securitizations and other sales, the Company has made standard representations and warranties customary to the consumer finance industry. Violations of these representations and warranties may require the Company to repurchase loans previously sold to on- or off-balance sheet trusts or other third parties. As of   September 30, 2015  , the Company had   no   repurchase requests outstanding. In the opinion of management, the potential exposure of other recourse obligations related to the Company s retail installment contract sales agreements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  Santander has provided guarantees on the covenants, agreements, and obligations of the Company under the governing documents of its warehouse facilities and privately issued amortizing notes. These guarantees are limited to the obligations of the Company as servicer. 
  Under terms of the agreement with Chrysler, the Company must make revenue sharing payments to Chrysler and also must make gain-sharing payments when residual gains on leased vehicles exceed a specified threshold. 
  The Company has a flow agreement with Bank of America whereby the Company is committed to sell up to a specified amount of eligible loans to the bank each month through   May 2018  . Prior to October 1, 2015, the amount of this monthly commitment was   $300,000  . On October 1, 2015, the Company and Bank of America amended the flow agreement to increase the maximum commitment to sell to   $350,000   of eligible loans each month, and to change the required written notice period from either party, in the event of termination of the agreement, from   120 days   to   90 days  .

On June 25, 2015, the Company executed an amendment to the servicing agreement with CBP, which increased the servicing fee the Company receives. The Company and CBP also amended the flow agreement which reduced, effective from and after August 1, 2015, CBP's committed purchases of Chrysler Capital prime loans from a maximum of   $600,000   and a minimum of   $250,000   per quarter to a maximum of   $200,000   and a minimum of   $50,000   per quarter, as may be adjusted according to the agreement. 
    
  The Company provided SBNA with the first right to review and approve consumer vehicle lease applications, subject to volume constraints, under terms of a flow agreement that was terminated on May 9, 2015. The Company has indemnified SBNA for potential credit and residual losses on   $48,226   of leases that had been originated by SBNA under this program but were subsequently determined not to meet SBNA s underwriting requirements. This indemnification agreement is supported by an equal amount of cash collateral posted by the Company in an SBNA bank account. The collateral account balance is included in restricted cash in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company additionally has agreed to indemnify SBNA for residual losses, up to a cap, on certain leases originated under the flow agreement between September 24, 2014 and May 9, 2015 for which SBNA and the Company had differing residual value expectations at lease inception. 
  In connection with the bulk sales of Chrysler Capital leases (Note 3), the Company is obligated to make quarterly payments to the purchaser sharing residual losses for lease terminations with losses over a specific percentage threshold. The estimated guarantee liability was   $3,857  , net, as of   September 30, 2015  .

The Company and the third party executed an amendment to the forward flow asset sale agreement on June 29, 2015, which increased the committed sales of charged off loan receivables in bankruptcy status to   $275,000  , and another amendment on September 29, 2015 requiring sales to occur quarterly.  
  
   41 

Previous to the most recent amendment there was no requirement on the timing of sales. As of   September 30, 2015  , the remaining aggregate commitment was   $203,449  .  
  Pursuant to the terms of a Separation Agreement among former CEO Thomas G. Dundon, the Company, DDFS LLC, SHUSA and Santander, upon satisfaction of applicable conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, the Company will owe Mr. Dundon a cash payment of up to   $115,139   (Note 12). 
    
  Legal and Regulatory Proceedings 
    
  Periodically, the Company is party to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. On August 26, 2014, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York (the "Steck Lawsuit"). On October 6, 2014, another purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas and was subsequently removed to the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas. Both lawsuits were filed against the Company, certain of its current and former directors and executive officers and certain institutions that served as underwriters in the Company's initial public offering. Each lawsuit was brought by a purported stockholder of the Company seeking to represent a class consisting of all those who purchased or otherwise acquired securities pursuant and/or traceable to the Company's Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the initial public offering. Each complaint alleged that the Registration Statement and Prospectus contained misleading statements concerning the Company s auto lending business and underwriting practices. Each lawsuit asserted claims under Section 11 and Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and seeks damages and other relief. In February 2015, the purported class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice. In June 2015, the venue of the Steck Lawsuit was transferred from the Southern District of New York to the Northern District of Texas. On October 15, 2015, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned   Feldman   v.   Jason A. Kulas, et al.  , C.A. No. 11614. The lawsuit names as defendants current and former members of the Company s board of directors, and names the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the current and former director defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with overseeing the Company s subprime auto lending practices, resulting in harm to the Company. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and equitable relief.

  On February 25, 2015, the Company entered into a consent order with the DOJ, approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, that resolves the DOJ's claims against the Company that certain of its repossession and collection activities during the period of time between January 2008 and February 2013 violated the SCRA. The consent order requires SC to pay a civil fine in the amount of   $55  , as well as at least   $9,360   to affected service members consisting of   $10   plus compensation for any lost equity (with interest) for each repossession by SC and   $5   for each instance where SC sought to collect repossession-related fees on accounts where a repossession was conducted by a prior account holder, as well as requires the Company to undertake additional remedial measures.  
    
  On July 31, 2015, the CFPB notified the Company that it had referred to the DOJ certain alleged violations by the Company of the ECOA regarding (i) statistical disparities in markups charged by automobile dealers to protected groups on loans originated by those dealers and purchased by the Company and (ii) the treatment of certain types of income in the Company's underwriting process. On September 25, 2015, the DOJ notified the Company that it has initiated, based on the referral from the CFPB, an investigation under the ECOA of the Company's pricing of automobile loans.

End Date, interest would accrue on the price paid per share in the Call Transaction at the overnight LIBOR rate on the third business day preceding the consummation of the Call Transaction plus   100   basis points with respect to any shares of Company common stock ultimately sold in the Call Transaction. 
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company paid certain expenses incurred by Mr. Dundon in the operation of a private plane in which he owns a partial interest when used for SC business within the contiguous 48 states. Under this practice, payment is based on a set flight time hourly rate, and the amount of reimbursement is not subject to a maximum cap per fiscal year. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company paid   $59   and   $115  , respectively, to Meregrass, Inc., the company managing the plane's operations, with an average rate of   $5.8   per hour. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company paid   $367   and   $529  , respectively, to Meregrass, Inc., with an average hourly rate of   $5.8  . 
    
  Under an agreement with Mr. Dundon, the Company is provided access to a suite at an event center that is leased by Mr. Dundon, and which the Company uses for business purposes. The Company reimburses Mr. Dundon for the use of this space on a periodic basis. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company reimbursed Mr. Dundon   $200   for the use of this space. As of   September 30, 2015  , the Company had a payable of   $200   to Mr. Dundon related to the use of this suite. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2015  , Jason Kulas, the Company's current CEO, Mr. Dundon, and a Santander employee who was a member of the SC Board of Directors until the second quarter of 2015, each had a minority equity investment in a property in which the Company leases   373,000   square feet as its corporate headquarters. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company paid   $1,504   and   $36  , respectively, in lease payments on this property. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company paid   $4,005   and   $144  , respectively, in lease payments on this property. Future minimum lease payments for the   12  -year term of the lease total   $79,550  . 
    
  The Company is party to certain agreements with a third party retailer whereby the Company is committed to purchase receivables originated by the retailer for an initial term ending in April 2020 and renewable through April 2022 at the retailer's option. In November 2014, Capmark, a company of which affiliates of Centerbridge owned an approximately   32%   interest, acquired the retailer. Prior to SC's IPO in January 2014, Centerbridge had a   7%   indirect ownership interest in SC. Immediately after the IPO, Centerbridge had an approximately   1%   interest in SC, which had decreased to less than   1%   by December 31, 2014 and further decreased to   zero   in February 2015. Further, an individual that was a member of SC's board of directors until July 15, 2015, is a member of Centerbridge management and also serves on the board of directors of Capmark. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , but only through the date these individuals were considered related parties (July 15, 2015), the Company advanced   $33,423   and   $442,339  , respectively, to the retailer, and received   $48,236   and   $575,179  , respectively, in payments on receivables originated under its agreements with the retailer. 
  At   December 31, 2014  , the Company had tax indemnification payments receivable of   $5,504   representing reimbursement of tax indemnification payments made to the original equity investors in   two   investment partnerships now owned by the Company.   One   of the equity investors, Centerbridge, also was an investor in SC until February 2015, and both investors had representation on SC's board until July 15, 2015. These payments are expected to be recovered through tax refunds passed through to the Company as the original investors recognize tax losses related to the investments.

    Computation of Basic and Diluted Earnings per Common Share (As Restated) 
       
  Earnings per common share is computed using the two-class method required for participating securities. Restricted stock awards are considered to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of a declaration of a dividend on the Company s common shares. 
    
  The calculation of earnings per share excludes employee stock option awards of   760,340   and   1,731,329   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , and   760,340   and   1,539,861   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, as the effect of those securities would be anti-dilutive. 

14. 
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments (As Restated) 
     Fair value measurement requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and also establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value as follows: 
  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
  Level 2 inputs are those other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
  Level 3 inputs are those that are unobservable for the asset or liability and are used to measure fair value to the extent relevant observable inputs are not available. 
  Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are as follows: 
  
   47 

(a) 
    Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash     The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, is at an approximated fair value as the instruments mature within 90 days or less and bear interest at market rates. 
              (b) 
    Receivables held for sale     Receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market, as determined on an aggregate basis. The estimated fair value is based on the prices obtained or expected to be obtained in the subsequent sales. Receivables held for sale also includes personal loans carried at cost, net of impairment, as of September 30, 2015. 
              (c) 
    Finance receivables held for investment, net     The carrying value and estimated fair value of finance receivables held for investment, net are reported at the aggregate carrying value and estimated fair value of the following financial instruments: 
                
    Retail installment contracts held for investment     Retail installment contracts held for investment are carried at amortized cost, net of credit loss allowance. The estimated fair value is calculated based on estimated market rates for similar contracts with similar credit risks. 
                
    Personal loans, net         Personal loans were carried at amortized cost, net of credit loss allowance. The estimated fair value was calculated based on estimated market rates for similar loans with similar credit risks. 
                
    Receivables from dealers held for investment, net     Receivables from dealers held for investment are carried at amortized cost, net of credit loss allowance. The estimated fair value is calculated based on estimated market rates for similar receivables with similar credit risks. 
                
    Capital lease receivables, net       Capital lease receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of the allowance for lease losses. The estimated fair value is calculated based on estimated market rates for similar contracts with similar credit risks. 
              (d) 
    Notes payable   credit facilities     The carrying amount of notes payable related to revolving credit facilities is estimated to approximate fair value. Management believes that the terms of these credit agreements approximate market terms for similar credit agreements.  
              (e) 
    Notes payable   secured structured financings     The estimated fair value of notes payable related to secured structured financings is calculated based on market quotes for the Company s publicly traded debt and estimated market rates currently available from recent transactions involving similar debt with similar credit risks. 
              (f) 
    Notes payable   related party     The carrying amount of notes payable to a related party is estimated to approximate fair value. Management believes that the terms of these credit agreements approximate market terms for similar credit agreements. 
     The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy: 
  
   48 

(a) 
    The valuation is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivative, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings and guarantees. The Company utilizes the exception in ASC 820-10-35-18D (commonly referred to as the  portfolio exception ) with respect to measuring counterparty credit risk for instruments (Note 8). 
              (b) 
    The total return swap was valued based on the estimated market value of the underlying bonds pledged to the associated credit facility. 
              (c) 
    Treasury bills are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 
     There were   no   amounts transferred into or out of Level 3 during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. The table below presents the changes in all Level 3 balances for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively: 
  
   49 

The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy: 

The Company estimates the fair value of its vehicles, which are obtained either through repossession or lease termination, using historical auction rates and current market levels of used car prices.  

15.    Employee Benefit Plans (As Restated) 
  SC Compensation Plan     Beginning in 2012, the Company granted stock options to certain executives, other employees, and independent directors under the MEP. The Plan was administered by the Board of Directors and enabled the Company to make stock awards up to a total of approximately   29 million   common shares (net of shares canceled and forfeited), or   8.5%   of the equity invested in the Company as of December 31, 2011. The MEP expired on January 31, 2015, and accordingly, no further awards will be made under this plan. In December 2013, the Board established the Omnibus Incentive Plan, which enables the Company to grant awards of nonqualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and other awards that may be settled in or based upon the value of the Company's common stock up to a total of   5,192,640   common shares. 
  Stock options granted have an exercise price based on the estimated fair market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date. The stock options expire after   ten   years and include both time vesting options and performance vesting options. The fair value of the stock options is amortized into income over the vesting period as time and performance vesting conditions are met. Under the Management Shareholders Agreement entered into by certain employees, no shares obtained through exercise of stock options could be transferred until the later of December 31, 2016, and the Company s execution of an IPO (the later date of which is referred to as the Lapse Date). Until the Lapse Date, if an employee were to leave the Company, the Company would have the right to repurchase any or all of the stock obtained by the employee through option exercise. If the employee were terminated for cause (as defined in the Plan) or voluntarily left the Company without good reason (as defined in the Plan), in each case, prior to the Lapse Date the repurchase price would be the lower of the strike price or fair market value at the date of repurchase. If the employee were terminated without cause or voluntarily left the Company with good reason, in each case, prior to the  
  
   50 

Lapse Date the repurchase price is the fair market value at the date of repurchase. Management believes the Company s repurchase right caused the IPO event to constitute an implicit vesting condition and therefore did not record any stock compensation expense until the date of the IPO. 
  On December 28, 2013, the Board approved certain changes to the Plan and the Management Shareholders Agreement, including acceleration of vesting for certain employees, removal of transfer restrictions for shares underlying a portion of the options outstanding under the Plan, and addition of transfer restrictions for shares underlying another portion of the outstanding options. All of the changes were contingent on, and effective upon, the Company s execution of an IPO and, as such, became effective upon pricing of the IPO on January 22, 2014. Also, on December 28, 2013, the Company granted   583,890   shares of restricted stock to certain executives under terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Compensation expense related to this restricted stock is recognized over a   five  -year vesting period, with   $7,423   and   $637   recorded for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, and   $8,639   and   $1,853   recorded for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
    
  On January 23, 2014, the Company executed an IPO, in which selling stockholders offered and sold to the public   85,242,042   shares of common stock at a price of   $24.00   per share. The Company received   no   proceeds from the initial public offering. Stock-based compensation expense totaling   $117,770   related to vested options was recognized upon the IPO, including expense related to accelerated vesting for certain executives of   $33,845  . Also, in connection with the IPO, the Company granted additional stock options under the Plan to certain executives, other employees, and an independent director with an estimated compensation cost of   $10,216  , which is being recognized over the awards' vesting period of   five   years for the employees and   three   years for the director. Additional stock option grants have been made during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to employees; the estimated compensation costs associated with these additional grants is   $3,355   and will be recognized over the vesting periods of the awards. 
  A summary of the Company s stock options and related activity as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   is as follows:   

In connection with compensation restrictions imposed on certain executive officers and other employees by the European Central Bank under the Capital Requirements Directive IV prudential rules, which require a portion of such officers' and employees' variable compensation to be paid in the form of equity, the Company granted RSUs in February and April 2015. A portion of the RSUs vested immediately upon grant, and a portion will vest annually over the next   three years  . In June 2015, as part of a separate long-term incentive plan, the Company granted certain officers RSUs that vest over a   three  -year period, with vesting dependent on Banco Santander performance over that time. After vesting, stock obtained through RSUs must be held for   one year  . 
  On July 2, 2015, Mr. Dundon exercised a right under the Separation Agreement to settle his vested options for a cash payment. Subject to limitations of banking regulators and applicable law, Mr. Dundon s Separation Agreement also provided that his unvested stock options would vest in full and his unvested restricted stock awards would continue to vest in accordance with their terms as if he remained employed by the Company. In addition, any service-based vesting requirements that were applicable to Mr. Dundon s outstanding RSUs in respect of his 2014 annual bonus were waived, and such RSUs continue to vest and be settled in accordance with the underlying award agreement. However, because the Separation Agreement did not receive the required regulatory approvals within   60   days of Mr. Dundon s termination without cause, both the vested and unvested stock options are considered to have expired.

    Shareholders' Equity 
     Treasury Stock 
  The Company had   52,141   shares of treasury stock outstanding with a cost of   $983   as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  . Prior to the IPO, the Company repurchased   3,154   shares as a result of an employee leaving the company. Additionally,   48,987   shares were withheld in December 2014 to cover income taxes related to the vesting of RSUs awarded to certain executive officers. The value of the treasury stock is immaterial and included within additional paid-in-capital. 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  A summary of changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   is as follows: 

(a) 
    Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   consist of the following: 

Dividend Restrictions 
    
  The Dodd-Frank Act requires certain banks and bank holding companies, including SHUSA, to perform stress testing and submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis. On March 11, 2015, the FRB informed SHUSA that, based on qualitative concerns, the FRB objected to SHUSA s capital plan pursuant to CCAR that SHUSA had previously submitted to the FRB. This objection followed the FRB's objection to the capital plan submitted the previous year, following which SHUSA entered into a written agreement with the FRB memorializing discussions under which, among other things, SHUSA is prohibited from allowing its non-wholly-owned nonbank subsidiaries, including the Company, to declare or pay any dividend, or to make any capital distribution, until such time as SHUSA has submitted to the FRB a capital plan and the FRB has issued a written non-objection to the plan, or the FRB otherwise issues its written non-objection to the proposed capital action. The Company will not pay any future dividends until such time as the FRB issues a written non-objection to a capital plan submitted by SHUSA or the FRB otherwise issues its written non-objection to the payment of a dividend by the Company. 
  
   52 

Termination of a Loan Purchase Agreement 
    
  In connection with the Company's strategic evaluation of its personal lending portfolio, the Company decided to reduce its exposure to personal loans on a prospective basis. In connection with that decision, on October 9, 2015, the Company delivered a   90  -day notice of termination of a loan purchase agreement between the Company and a peer-to-peer personal lending platform company. Under that agreement, the Company had committed to purchase at least the lesser of   $30,000   per month or   50%   of the lending platform company s "near-prime" (as that term is defined in the agreements) originations. In accordance with the provisions of the Loan Purchase Agreement, the termination of the agreement will be effective   90 days   following delivery of the notice.

    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A) and in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. Additional information about the Company is available on the Company s website at   www.santanderconsumerusa.com  . The Company s recent annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, proxy statements, as well as other filings with the SEC, are available free of charge through the Company s website by clicking on the  Investors  page and selecting  All SEC Filings.  The SEC s website also contains current reports, information statements, and other information regarding the Company at   www.sec.gov  . 
  Overview 
    
  Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. is the holding company for Santander Consumer USA Inc., a full-service, technology-driven consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance. We are majority-owned (as of   September 30, 2015  , approximately   59.0%  ) by SHUSA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander. 
  The Company is managed through a single reporting segment, Consumer Finance, which includes our vehicle financial products and services, including retail installment contracts, vehicle leases, and dealer loans, as well as financial products and services related to motorcycles, RVs, and marine vehicles. It also includes our personal loan and point-of-sale financing operations. 
  Since May 1, 2013, we have been the preferred provider for Chrysler s consumer loans and leases and dealer loans under terms of a ten-year agreement with Chrysler. Business generated under terms of the Chrysler Agreement is branded as Chrysler Capital. In conjunction with the Chrysler Agreement, the Company offers a full spectrum of auto financing products and services to Chrysler customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand. These products and services include consumer retail installment contracts and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit. 
  Under the terms of the Chrysler Agreement, certain standards were agreed to which include SC meeting specified escalating penetration rates for the first five years, and Chrysler treating SC in a manner consistent with comparable OEMs' treatment of their captive providers, primarily in regard to sales support. The success of the Chrysler agreement is dependent upon the ability of both parties to meet and uphold these standards.  
  The target penetration rate as of April 30, 2015 (the end of the second year of the Chrysler Agreement) was 44%, and the target penetration rate for the third year is set at 54%. Our actual penetration rate as of   September 30, 2015   was 25% as interest rates have remained low, causing our subvented loan and lease offers not to be materially more attractive than other lenders' offers. We remain confident about the ongoing success of the Chrysler Agreement. Since its May 1, 2013, launch, Chrysler Capital has originated $27.5 billion in retail loans and $11.0 billion in leases, and facilitated the origination of $3.0 billion in leases and dealer loans for an affiliate. 
  The Company also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle retail installment contracts from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, the Company has several relationships through which it provides unsecured consumer loans, private-label credit cards and other consumer finance products. 
  We have flow agreements and dedicated financing facilities in place for our Chrysler Capital business. We periodically sell consumer retail installment contracts through these flow agreements, and, when market conditions are favorable, we will access the ABS market through securitizations of consumer retail installment contracts. We also periodically enter into bulk sales of consumer vehicle leases with a third party. We typically retain servicing of loans and leases sold or securitized, and may also retain some residual risk in sales of leases. We have also entered into an agreement with the buyer of our leases whereby we will periodically sell charged-off loans. 
   
  Economic and Business Environment 
  The U.S. economy has continued its slow-paced recovery into 2015. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment declined from 5.6% at the beginning of the year to 5.1% as of   September 30, 2015  . Although the Federal Reserve signaled that it may raise rates in   2015  , uncertainty remains as to the timing of any such increase in the near term. New cars are selling at a pace to exceed an annualized rate of 18 million for   2015  .  
  
   54 

Regulatory Matters 
  The U.S. lending industry is highly regulated under various U.S. federal laws, including the Truth-in-Lending, Equal Credit Opportunity, Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practices, SCRA, and Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices, Credit CARD, Telephone Consumer Protection, FIRREA, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Acts, as well as various state laws. We are subject to inspections, examinations, supervision, and regulation by the Commission, the CFPB, the FTC, the DOJ and by regulatory agencies in each state in which we are licensed. In addition, we are subject to certain bank regulations, including oversight by the OCC, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve, which has the ability to limit certain of our activities, such as the timing and amount of dividends and certain transactions that we might otherwise desire to enter into, such as merger and acquisition opportunities, or to impose other limitations on our growth. 
  Regulation AB II 
  In response to investor requests for greater transparency, on August 27, 2014, the Commission unanimously voted to adopt final rules known as Regulation AB II, that, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process. All filings on Forms 10-D or 10-K that are submitted after November 23, 2015 must comply with new rules and disclosures, except asset-level disclosures. These rules will affect the Company's public securitization platform. 
  Additionally, on August 27, 2014, the Commission adopted final rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to third-party due diligence reports for asset-backed securities. The final rules took effect in June 2015, and unlike Regulation AB II, apply to both SC's public and non-public asset-backed securitization platforms. 
  Additional legal and regulatory matters affecting the Company's activities are further discussed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors of our 2014 annual report. 
   
  How We Assess Our Business Performance 
    
  Net income, and the associated return on assets and equity, are the primary metrics by which we judge the performance of our business. Accordingly, we closely monitor the primary drivers of net income: 

Net financing income     We track the spread between the interest and finance charge income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred on our liabilities, and continually monitor the components of our yield and our cost of funds. In addition, we monitor external rate trends, including the Treasury swap curve and spot and forward rates. 
                
    Net credit losses     We perform net credit loss analysis at the vintage level for individually acquired retail installment contracts, loans and leases, and at the pool level for purchased portfolios, enabling us to pinpoint drivers of any unusual or unexpected trends. We also monitor recovery rates, both industry-wide and our own. Additionally, because delinquencies are an early indicator of future net credit losses, we analyze delinquency trends, adjusting for seasonality, to determine whether or not our loans are performing in line with our original estimation.  
                
    Other income     The various flow agreements in connection with our Chrysler relationship have resulted in a growing portfolio of assets serviced for others. These assets provide a steady stream of servicing income and may provide a gain or loss on sale. We monitor the size of the portfolio and average servicing fee rate and gain. Additionally, our personal lending business provides fee income, which we monitor as an input to return on the personal loan portfolio. 
                
    Operating expenses     We assess our operational efficiency using our cost-to-assets ratio. We perform extensive analysis to determine whether observed fluctuations in operating expense levels indicate a trend or are the nonrecurring impact of large projects. Our operating expense analysis also includes a loan- and portfolio-level review of origination and servicing costs to assist us in assessing profitability by pool and vintage. 
       
  Because volume and portfolio size determine the magnitude of the impact of each of the above factors on our earnings, we also closely monitor origination and sales volume along with APR and discounts (including subvention and net of dealer participation).

Third Quarter     2015   Summary of Results 
  Our strong performance in the   third quarter   of   2015   highlights our ability to execute on our strategy of optimizing the mix of retained assets versus assets sold and serviced for others. These key highlights included: 
             
    Growth of   13.6%   in net finance and other interest income compared to the same quarter in   2014  ; 
                 
    Originations of   $7.6 billion  , in line with $7.6 billion in the prior quarter and up from   $7.4 billion   originated in the same quarter in   2014  ; 
                 
    Serviced for others portfolio of   $14.8 billion  , up from $13.1 billion in the prior quarter and   $10.2 billion   in the same period last year; 
                
    Expense ratio of   2.1%  , consistent with   2.1%   in the prior quarter and up from   2.0%   in the same quarter last year. 
     Recent Developments and Other Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
  Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements 
  As discussed further in Note 2 of the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-Q/A, 
  we are restating herein our unaudited quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. The following discussion has been updated to reflect the effects of the restatement. 
  Personal Lending Platform 
  We periodically perform a strategic evaluation of the Company's assets held for investment to ensure that the product mix meets our investment objectives. As of September 30, 2015, we determined that we no longer had the intent to hold personal loans for investment purposes and we will reduce our exposure to personal lending on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we have reclassified our entire personal loan portfolio to 'finance receivables held for sale' as of September 30, 2015. 
  In contemplation of our decision to reduce our exposure to personal lending, on August8, 2015, we stopped purchasing prime  consumer loans from a peer-to-peer lending platform company we worked with and on October 9, 2015, we delivered a 90-day notice of termination of a loan purchase agreement between the Company and the same peer-to-peer personal lending platform company. Under that agreement, the Company was committed to purchase at least the lesser of   $30,000   per month or   50%   of the lending platform company s "near-prime" (as that term is defined in the agreements) originations. We continue to be party to various other agreements under which we purchase specified volumes of personal loans originated by third parties and we will continue to perform in accordance with the terms and operative provisions of those agreements. 
  Allowance for Credit Losses 
  As discussed in our   Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2015  , the reclassification of our personal lending portfolio to finance receivables held for sale resulted in a decrease to our provision for credit losses of $14 million. 
  Asset Sales and Securitizations 
  During the   third quarter   of   2015  , we executed three on-balance sheet securitizations, with net bonds sold of   $2.9 billion  , and we advanced   $987 million   on new and existing private term amortizing facilities and revolving facilities. We also settled the sales of  residual interests in certain securitization trusts for the first time for cash proceeds of   $662 million  . Additionally, in line with our strategy to leverage our servicing platform and increase servicing fee income, we executed several other transactions, which are discussed in greater detail in the   Liquidity Management, Funding and Capital Resources   section of management's discussion and analysis. 
  Amendments to Flow Agreements 
  On October 1, 2015, we executed an amendment to the flow agreement with Bank of America, pursuant to which the Company increased its monthly commitment to sell eligible loans to Bank of America to a maximum of   $350 million  . The amendment also changed the requisite notification period for termination of the agreement from 120 days to 90 days. 
  On June 25, 2015, we executed an amendment to the flow agreement with CBP, which increased the servicing fee the Company receives for the servicing of assets sold under the agreement. The amendment also reduced, effective from and after August 1, 2015, CBP s committed purchases of Chrysler Capital prime loans. We have mitigated the reduction in committed purchases, in part, through further development of new business relationships. 
  
   56 

The Company also entered into amendments to the flow agreement under which we are committed to selling charged off loan receivables in bankruptcy status. These amendments increased the committed sales of charged off loans receivable in bankruptcy and specified that sales must occur on at least quarterly basis. 
  Shelf Registration Statement 
  In March 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 to register up to 245,593,555 shares of our common stock held by SHUSA and DDFS LLC, an entity solely owned by Mr. Dundon. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of any shares offered under such shelf registration statement. 
  Dividend Restrictions 
  The Dodd-Frank Act requires certain banks and bank holding companies, including SHUSA, to perform stress testing and submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis. On March 11, 2015, the FRB informed SHUSA that, based on qualitative concerns, the FRB objected to SHUSA s capital plan pursuant to CCAR that SHUSA had previously submitted to the FRB. This objection followed the FRB's objection to the capital plan submitted the previous year, following which SHUSA entered into a written agreement with the FRB memorializing discussions under which, among other things, SHUSA is prohibited from allowing its non-wholly-owned nonbank subsidiaries, including the Company, to declare or pay any dividend, or to make any capital distribution, until such time as SHUSA has submitted to the FRB a capital plan and the FRB has issued a written non-objection to the plan, or the FRB otherwise issues its written non-objection to the proposed capital action. The Company will not pay any future dividends until such time as the FRB issues a written non-objection to a capital plan submitted by SHUSA or the FRB otherwise issues its written non-objection to the payment of a dividend by the Company.

Volume 
  Our originations of individually acquired loans and leases, including net balance increases on revolving loans, average APR, and discount during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014   have been as follows:

    Certain previously reported amounts have been restated to correct for various financial statement errors. See Footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. 
     Our ending held for investment portfolio, average APR, and remaining unaccreted discount as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014   are as follows: 

(a) 
    Certain previously reported amounts have been restated to correct for various financial statement errors. See Footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. 
              (b) 
    As of   September 30, 2015   all of the Company's personal loans were classified as held for sale.  
     We record interest income from individually acquired retail installment contracts, personal loans and receivables from dealers in accordance with the terms of the loans, generally discontinuing and reversing accrued income once a loan becomes more than 60 days past due, except in the case of revolving personal loans, for which we continue to accrue interest until charge-off, in the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due, and receivables from dealers, for which we continue to accrue interest until the loan becomes more than 90 days past due. Receivables from dealers and term personal loans generally are not acquired at a discount. We amortize discounts, subvention payments from manufacturers, and origination costs as adjustments to income from individually acquired retail installment contracts using the effective yield method. We amortize the discount, if applicable, on revolving personal loans straight-line over the estimated period over which the receivables are expected to be outstanding. 
  For individually acquired retail installment contracts, personal loans, capital leases, and receivables from dealers, we also establish a credit loss allowance for the estimated losses inherent in the portfolio. We estimate probable losses based on contractual delinquency status, historical loss experience, expected recovery rates from sale of repossessed collateral,  
  
   59 

bankruptcy trends, and general economic conditions such as unemployment rates. For loans within these portfolios that are classified as TDRs, impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
  We classify most of our vehicle leases as operating leases. The net capitalized cost of each lease is recorded as an asset, which is depreciated straight-line over the contractual term of the lease to the expected residual value. Lease payments due from customers are recorded as income until and unless a customer becomes more than 60 days delinquent, at which time the accrual of revenue is discontinued and reversed. The accrual is resumed and reinstated if a delinquent account subsequently becomes 60 days or less past due. Subvention payments from the manufacturer, down payments from the customer, and initial direct costs incurred in connection with originating the lease are amortized straight-line over the contractual term of the lease. 
  Historically, our primary means of acquiring retail installment contracts has been through individual acquisitions immediately after origination by a dealer. We also periodically purchase pools of receivables and had significant volumes of these purchases during the credit crisis. While we continue to pursue such opportunities when available, we did not purchase any pools during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  . All of the retail installment contracts acquired during these periods were acquired individually. For our existing purchased receivables portfolios, which were acquired at a discount partially attributable to credit deterioration since origination, we estimate the expected yield on each portfolio at acquisition and record monthly accretion income based on this expectation. We periodically re-evaluate performance expectations and may increase the accretion rate if a pool is performing better than expected. If a pool is performing worse than expected, we are required to continue to record accretion income at the previously established rate and to record impairment to account for the worsening performance.

Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015   Compared to   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2014   (As Restated) 
  Interest on Finance Receivables and Loans 

Income from individually acquired retail installment contracts   increased     $141 million  , or   14%  , from the   third   quarter of   2014   to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   increased     $406 million  , or   14%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , consistent with the growth in the average outstanding balance of our portfolio of these contracts of   $3.3 billion  , or   14.3%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Retained originations during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   carried an average APR of   16.1%   and   17.2%  , respectively, compared to an average APR of   15.0%   and   15.9%   for the same periods in   2014  . 
  Income from purchased receivables portfolios   decreased     $26 million  , or   61%  , from the   third   quarter of   2014   to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   decreased     $98 million  , or   60%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to the continued runoff of the portfolios, as we have made no portfolio acquisitions since 2012. The average balance of the portfolios decreased from   $1.1 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2014  , to   $0.5 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
  Income from personal loans   increased     $28 million  , or   33%  , from the   third   quarter of   2014   to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   increased     $86 million  , or   34%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , less than the growth in the average outstanding portfolio of   61%   due to the increasing mix of installment loans, which are of a higher average credit quality and bear a lower average interest rate than our revolving loans. 
  Leased Vehicle Income and Expense 

Leased vehicle income and expense   increased   significantly from prior year due to the continual growth in the portfolio since we launched Chrysler Capital in 2013. Total lease originations during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   24%   higher than in the same quarter in   2014  , and   10%   higher than for the   three   months ended June 30, 2015. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , originations have continued to outpace the maturity (or run-off) of existing leases. 

66 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense on notes payable   increased     $26 million  , or   21%  , from the   third   quarter of   2014   to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   increased     $61 million  , or   17%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   consistent with the growth in average debt outstanding, which has increased   15%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Interest expense has also increased as our cost of funds have increased over the same period. 
  Interest expense on derivatives   increased     $16 million  , or   202%  , from the   third   quarter of   2014   to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   increased     $28 million  , or   91%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to an increase in the outstanding notional amounts on our derivatives and more unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments impacted by interest rate changes during   three and nine   month periods in   2015   compared to the same periods in   2014  . The   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were also impacted from the expiry of the total return swap in May 2015. 
  Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses on our individually acquired retail installment contracts   increased     $34 million  , or   6%  , from the   third   quarter of   2014   to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   increased     $63 million  , or   4%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Although provision for credit losses remained relatively flat period over period, the provision for credit losses was reduced in connection with the sale of certain assets. We also recorded lower of cost or market adjustments for certain loans upon sale or upon reclassification to held for sale, which were reflected as a charge-off against the credit loss allowance. The impact of these sales and lower of cost or market adjustments to the provision for credit losses was a reduction to provision expense of approximately   $38 million   and   $113 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  During 2015, we have also sold individually acquired retail contracts with a much higher average credit quality compared to loans originated during the same period, resulting in approximately   36%   of outstanding consumer loans falling into the  599 FICO        band group as of   September 30, 2015   compared to   41%   as of   December 31, 2014  . This change in portfolio mix resulted in additional provisions for credit losses. 
  Change in incremental increase (decrease) in impairment related to purchased receivables portfolios resulted from the release of impairment on purchased receivables in   2014   and   2015   as performance continued to improve. 
  Provision for credit losses on personal loans   decreased     $29 million  , or   21%  , from the   third quarter   of   2014   to the   third quarter   of   2015  , and   increased     $25 million  , or   8%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net impact of the reclassification of our personal loans to held for sale was a positive impact to the  
  
   67 

provision for credit losses of   $14 million   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , originations and purchases of personal loans were   37%   lower than in the same period in   2014  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , factors impacting provision for credit losses included the   46%   growth in the average unpaid principal balance of the portfolio and a credit reassessment performed earlier in the year which indicated a higher percentage of loans in the  560 FICO        band group. 
    
  We began recording provision for credit losses on capital leases subsequent to the   third   quarter of   2014   as we established a portfolio of leases classified as capital leases and began recording provision on these assets. However, in early 2015 we terminated the lending relationship that gave rise to our capital lease portfolio, and therefore, provisions for credit losses on this portfolio have tapered off. 
  Profit Sharing 

Profit sharing consists of revenue sharing related to the Chrysler Agreement and profit sharing on personal loans originated pursuant to our agreements with Bluestem. Profit sharing   decreased   moderately in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   compared to the same period in   2014  , as the Bluestem portfolio became more seasoned reflecting increased delinquencies, and charge-offs were recognized, resulting in a decrease in the amount of payments due to Bluestem. This was partially offset by an increase in revenue sharing due to Chrysler as originations and third party sales increased, which increased profit sharing expense during the   third   quarter of 2015. 
  Other Income 

Investment gains decreased   $8 million   in     the     third   quarter of   2015   compared to the   third   quarter of   2014   as a result of the non-recurrence of a gain recognized on a CCART securitization that settled during the   third   quarter of   2014  . Investment gains increased during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   as compared to the same period of   2014  , primarily due to the sale of loans to a new third party purchaser in the second quarter of 2015. We also executed two bulk lease sales to a third party during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , whereas there were no such lease sales in   2014  .  
  We record servicing fee income on loans that we service but do not own and do not report on our balance sheet. Servicing fee income   increased     $15 million  , or   75%  , from the   third   quarter of   2014   to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   increased     $36 million  , or   67%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as we continued to grow our serviced portfolio through asset sales. Our serviced for others portfolio as of   September 30, 2015   and   2014   was as follows: 
  
   68 

Fees, commissions, and other   increased     $5 million  , or   5%  , from the   third   quarter of   2014   to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   increased     $18 million  , or   6%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to additional fee income as our revolving personal loan portfolio grew. The increase in fees and commissions attributable to growth in the organic and personal loan portfolio were offset by the run-off of the purchased loan portfolio, where fees and commissions for the   three and nine   months ended 2015 were   $12.0 million   and   $21.7 million   lower than the same periods in   2014  . Additionally, we recorded   $7.9 million   in deficiency income from the sale of charged-off assets in the first   nine   months of   2015   compared to   $14.7 million   in the same period of   2014  . 
  Total Operating Expenses 

Total operating expenses   increased     $58 million  , or   29%  , from the   third   quarter of   2014   to the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   increased     $29 million  , or   4%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   impacted most notably by salary and benefits expense.  
  For the   third   quarter of   2015  , salary and benefits expenses   increased   by   $25 million  , or   28%   compared to the same period in   2014  , which was primarily attributable to an increase in average headcount of 13% compared to   September 30, 2014  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , salary and benefits expense decreased   $59 million  , or   15%   compared to the same period in   2014  , primarily due to the non-recurrence of   $120 million   in stock compensation and other IPO-related expenses recorded upon and in connection with our IPO in January 2014, partly offset by increased headcount. Repossession expense increased for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   as a result of portfolio growth. After adjusting for the IPO-related expenses in   2014  , our expense ratio decreased from   2.7%   in the first   nine   months of   2014   to   2.1%   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
  Income Tax Expense 

Our effective tax rate   increased   from   35.5%   in the   third   quarter of   2014   to   36.6%   in the   third   quarter of   2015   and   decreased   from   36.0%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to   35.7%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   is primarily due to favorable permanent book to tax differences recognized during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2014  .  
  
   69 

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

The change in unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   was primarily driven by unfavorable interest rate movements in the first   three and nine   months of   2015   as compared to favorable interest rate movements in the first   three and nine   months of   2014  . 
  
   70 

Credit Quality 
  Finance Receivables 
  Nonprime loans comprise   82%   of our portfolio as of   September 30, 2015  . We record an allowance for credit losses to cover our estimate of inherent losses on our individually acquired retail installment contracts and other loans and receivables held for investment.  

(a) 
    Certain previously reported amounts have been restated to correct for various financial statement errors. See Footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. 
              (b) 
    As of   September 30, 2015   all of the Company's personal loans were classified as held for sale. 

(a) 
    Certain previously reported amounts have been restated to correct for various financial statement errors. See Footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. 
       
  For retail installment contracts we acquired in pools subsequent to their origination, we anticipate the expected credit losses at purchase and record income thereafter based on the expected effective yield, recording impairment if performance is worse than expected at purchase. The balances of these purchased receivables portfolios were as follows at   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  : 

(a) 
    Certain previously reported amounts have been restated to correct for various financial statement errors. See Footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. 

71 

Delinquency 
  An account is considered delinquent if a substantial portion of a scheduled payment has not been received by the date such payment was contractually due. Delinquencies may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio, seasonality within the calendar year, and economic factors. Historically, our delinquencies have been highest in the period from November through January due to consumers  holiday spending. 
  The following is a summary of delinquencies as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  : 

(a) 
    Includes retail installment contracts acquired individually and purchased receivables portfolios. 
              (b) 
    Percent of unpaid principal balance. 
     All of our receivables from dealers and all of our retail installment contracts held for sale were current as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  . Delinquencies on the capital lease receivables portfolio, which commenced originations in 2014, were immaterial as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  . 
  Credit Loss Experience 
  The following is a summary of our net losses and repossession activity on our finance receivables for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  . 

(a) 
    Certain previously reported amounts have been restated to correct for various financial statement errors. See Footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. 
              (1) 
    Repossessions are net of redemptions. The number of repossessions includes repossessions from the outstanding portfolio and from accounts already charged off. 
              (2) 
    Annualized; not necessarily indicative of a full year's actual results. 
              (3) 
    For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , net losses on retail installment contracts held for investment and personal loans include lower of cost or market adjustments of   $73,388   and   $377,598  , respectively, which were charged off against the credit loss allowance. 
              (4) 
    As of   September 30, 2015   all of the Company's personal loans were classified as held for sale. 
     We have had no charge-offs on our receivables from dealers and no material net charge-offs on our capital lease receivables. 
  
   72 

Deferrals and Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  In accordance with our policies and guidelines, we, at times, offer extensions ("deferrals") to consumers on our retail installment contracts, whereby the consumer is allowed to move a maximum of three payments per event to the end of the loan. Over 90% of deferrals granted are for two months. Our policies and guidelines limit the frequency of each new deferral that may be granted to one deferral every six months, regardless of the length of any prior deferral. The maximum number of lifetime months extended for all automobile retail installment contracts is eight, while some marine and recreational vehicle contracts have a maximum of twelve months extended to reflect their longer term. Additionally, we generally limit the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of payments has been received. During the deferral period, we continue to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement. 
  At the time a deferral is granted, all delinquent amounts may be deferred or paid, resulting in the classification of the loan as current and therefore not considered a delinquent account. Thereafter, such account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account. 
  The following is a summary of deferrals on our retail installment contracts held for investment as of the dates indicated: 

We evaluate the results of our deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred versus the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, we believe that payment deferrals granted according to our policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio. 
    
  Changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged off by us. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts for loans classified as TDRs used in the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for credit losses and related provision for credit losses. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses and related provision for credit losses, including the allowance and provision for loans that are not classified as TDRs. For loans that are classified as TDRs, the present value of expected cash flows is compared to the outstanding recorded investment of our TDRs to determine the amount of TDR impairment and related provision for credit losses that should be recorded. 
  We also may agree, or be required by operation of law or by a bankruptcy court, to grant a modification involving one or a combination of the following: a reduction in interest rate, a reduction in loan principal balance, a temporary reduction of monthly payment, or an extension of the maturity date. The servicer of our revolving personal loans also may grant modifications in the form of principal or interest rate reductions or payment plans. Similar to deferrals, we believe modifications are an effective portfolio management technique. Not all modifications are classified as TDRs as the loan may not meet the scope of the applicable guidance or the modification may have been granted for a reason other than the borrower's financial difficulties. The following is a summary of the principal balance as of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014   of loans that have received these modifications and concessions:

     As of   September 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , we did not have any dealer loans classified as TDRs and had not granted deferrals or modifications on any of these loans. 
   
  Liquidity Management, Funding and Capital Resources 
  We require a significant amount of liquidity to originate and acquire loans and leases and to service debt. We fund our operations through our lending relationships with fourteen third-party banks and Santander, as well as through securitization in the ABS market and large flow agreements. We seek to issue debt that appropriately matches the cash flows of the assets that we originate. We have over   $4.4 billion   of stockholders  equity that supports our access to the securitization markets, credit facilities, and flow agreements. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we completed on-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately   $12 billion  , including:  
             
    four securitizations on our SDART platform for   $4.6 billion  ; 
                
    a series of seven subordinate bond transactions on our SDART platform totaling   $262 million   to fund residual interests from existing securitizations; 
                
    four securitizations on our relaunched DRIVE, deeper subprime platform, for   $3.4 billion  ; 
     
   74 

top-ups of four private amortizing facilities totaling   $1.6 billion  ; and 
                
    four private amortizing lease facilities totaling   $2.0 billion 
     We also completed   $7.3 billion   in asset sales, including   $1.3 billion   in third-party lease sales and   $3.2 billion   in recurring monthly sales with our third party flow partners, in addition to executing several sales of charged off assets totaling   $118 million   in proceeds. 
  As of   September 30, 2015  , our debt consisted of the following: 

Credit Facilities 
  Third-party Revolving Credit Facilities 
  Warehouse Lines 
  We use warehouse lines to fund our originations. Each line specifies the required collateral characteristics, collateral concentrations, credit enhancement, and advance rates. Our warehouse lines generally are backed by auto retail installment contracts and, in some cases, leases or personal loans. These credit lines generally have one- or two-year commitments, staggered maturities and floating interest rates. We maintain daily funding forecasts for originations, acquisitions, and other large outflows such as tax payments in order to balance the desire to minimize funding costs with our liquidity needs. 
  Our warehouse lines generally have net spread, delinquency, and net loss ratio limits. Generally, these limits are calculated based on the portfolio collateralizing the respective line; however, for two of our warehouse lines, delinquency and net loss ratios are calculated with respect to our serviced portfolio as a whole. Failure to meet any of these covenants could trigger increased overcollateralization requirements or, in the case of limits calculated with respect to the specific portfolio underlying certain credit lines, result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurs under one of these agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the impacted agreement to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against collateral pledged under the agreement, restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under the agreement, and/or remove us as servicer. We have never had a warehouse line terminated due to failure to comply with any ratio or a failure to meet any covenant. A default under one of these agreements can be enforced only with respect to the impacted warehouse line. 
  We have a credit facility with eight banks providing an aggregate commitment of   $4.2 billion   for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support Chrysler retail financing. The facility can be used for both loan and lease financing. The facility requires reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, or residual loss ratios exceeding specified thresholds. 
  Repurchase Facility 
  We also obtain financing through an investment management agreement whereby we pledge retained subordinate bonds on our own securitizations as collateral for repurchase agreements with various borrowers and at renewable terms ranging from 30 to 90 days.  
  Lines of Credit with Santander and Related Subsidiaries 
  Santander historically has provided, and continues to provide, our business with significant funding support in the form of committed credit facilities. Through its New York branch, Santander provides us with   $4.5 billion   of long-term committed  
  
   75 

revolving credit facilities. SHUSA provides us with an additional   $300 million   of committed revolving credit, collateralized by residuals retained on our own securitizations. 
  The facilities offered through the New York branch are structured as three- and five-year floating rate facilities, with current maturity dates of December 31, 2016 and 2018. Santander has the option to allow us to continue to renew the term of these facilities annually going forward, thereby maintaining the three and five year maturities. These facilities currently permit unsecured borrowing but generally are collateralized by retail installment contracts as well as securitization notes payables and residuals by the Company. Any secured balances outstanding under the facilities at the time of their maturity will amortize to match the maturities and expected cash flows of the corresponding collateral. 
  There was an average outstanding balance of   $3.7 billion   and   $3.6 billion   under the facilities offered through the New York branch during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. The maximum outstanding balance during each period was   $4.4 billion   and   $4.3 billion  , respectively. There was an average outstanding balance of   $300 million   under the SHUSA credit facility during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , and   $299 million   from the line's inception on March 6, 2014 through   September 30, 2014  ; the maximum outstanding balance during each of those periods was   $300 million  .  
  Santander affiliates also serve as the counterparty for many of our derivative financial instruments. 
  Secured Structured Financings 
  Our secured structured financings primarily consist of public, SEC-registered securitizations. We also execute private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and privately issue amortizing notes.  
  We obtain long-term funding for our receivables through securitization in the ABS market. ABS provides an attractive source of funding due to the cost efficiency of the market, a large and deep investor base, and tenors that appropriately match the cash flows of the debt to the cash flows of the underlying assets. The term structure of a securitization generally locks in fixed rate funding for the life of the underlying fixed rate assets, and the matching amortization of the assets and liabilities provides committed funding for the collateralized loans throughout their terms. In certain cases, we may choose to issue floating rate securities based on market conditions; in such cases, we generally execute hedging arrangements outside of the Trust to lock in our cost of funds. Because of prevailing market rates, we did not issue ABS transactions in 2008 and 2009, but we began issuing ABS again in 2010. We have been the largest issuer of retail auto ABS since 2011, and have issued a total of over   $46.0 billion   in retail auto ABS since 2010. 
  We execute each securitization transaction by selling receivables to securitization trusts ( Trusts ) that issue ABS to investors. In order to attain specified credit ratings for each class of bonds, these securitization transactions have credit enhancement requirements in the form of subordination, restricted cash accounts, excess cash flow, and overcollateralization, whereby more receivables are transferred to the Trusts than the amount of ABS issued by the Trusts. 
  Excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance and interest income received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to the ABS investors, net of credit losses and expenses. Initially, excess cash flows generated by the Trusts are used to pay down outstanding debt in the Trusts, increasing overcollateralization until the targeted percentage level of assets has been reached. Once the targeted percentage level of overcollateralization is reached and maintained, excess cash flows generated by the Trusts are released to us as distributions from the Trusts. We also receive monthly servicing fees as servicer for the Trusts. Our securitizations may require an increase in credit enhancement levels if Cumulative Net Losses, as defined in the documents underlying each ABS transaction, exceed a specified percentage of the pool balance. None of our securitizations have Cumulative Net Loss percentages above their respective limits. 
  Our on-balance sheet securitization transactions utilize bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities, which are considered variable interest entities, that meet the requirements to be consolidated in our financial statements. Following a securitization, the finance receivables and the notes payable related to the securitized retail installment contracts remain on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We recognize finance and interest income as well as fee income on the collateralized retail installment contracts and interest expense on the ABS issued. We also record a provision for credit losses to cover our estimate of inherent credit losses on the retail installment contracts. While these Trusts are consolidated in our financial statements, these Trusts are separate legal entities; thus, the finance receivables and other assets sold to these Trusts are legally owned by these Trusts, are available only to satisfy the notes payable related to the securitized retail installment contracts, and are not available to our creditors or our other subsidiaries. 
  We have completed   nine   securitizations year-to-date in   2015  , in addition to executing seven subordinate bond transactions to obtain additional liquidity from residual interests in existing securitizations. We currently have   34   securitizations outstanding in  
  
   76 

the market with a cumulative ABS balance of approximately   $15.9 billion  . Our securitizations generally have several classes of notes, with principal paid sequentially based on seniority and any excess spread distributed to the residual holder. We generally retain the lowest bond class and the residual, except in the case of off-balance sheet securitizations, which are described further below. We use the proceeds from securitization transactions to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, originate and acquire loans and leases, and for general corporate purposes. We generally exercise clean-up call options on our securitizations when the collateral pool balance reaches 10% of its original balance.  
  We also periodically privately issue amortizing notes, in transactions that are structured similarly to our public and Rule 144A securitizations but are issued to banks and conduits. The Company s securitizations and private issuances are collateralized by vehicle retail installment contracts, loans and vehicle leases.  
  Flow Agreements 
    
  In addition to our credit facilities and secured structured financings, we have flow agreements in place with Bank of America and CBP for Chrysler Capital retail installment contracts, with another third party for charged off assets, and with SBNA for Chrysler Capital dealer loans. 
  In order to manage our balance sheet and provide funding for our originations, we have entered into flow agreements under which we will sell, or otherwise source to third parties, loans and leases on a periodic basis. These loans and leases are not on our balance sheet but provide a stable stream of servicing fee income and may also provide a gain or loss on sale. We continue to actively seek additional such flow agreements. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Financing 
  We periodically execute Chrysler Capital-branded securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. Because all of the notes and residual interests in these securitizations are issued to third parties, we record these transactions as true sales of the retail installment contracts securitized, and remove the sold assets from our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We executed our first off-balance sheet securitization of 2015 on April 15, selling   $769 million   of gross retail installment contracts.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we executed our first two bulk sales of leases to a third party. Due to the accelerated depreciation permitted for tax purposes, these two sales generated large taxable gains that we have deferred through a qualified like-kind exchange program. In order to qualify for this deferral, we are required to maintain the sale proceeds in escrow until reinvested in new lease originations. Because the sale proceeds also were needed to pay down the third party credit facilities on which we had financed the leases prior to their sale, we have increased our borrowings on our related party credit facilities temporarily until the sale proceeds are fully reinvested over the 180 days following each sale. 
   
  Cash Flow Comparison 
  We have produced positive net cash from operating activities every year since 2003. Our investing activities primarily consist of originations and acquisitions of finance receivables and leased vehicles. Our financing activities primarily consist of borrowing and repayments of debt.  

(a) 
    Certain previously reported amounts have been restated to correct for various financial statement errors. See Footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. 
     Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities   decreased     $94 million   from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily driven by   $563 million   in increased cash outflows for originations held for sale and   $246 million   in lower proceeds from sales and repayments of receivables held for sale, offset by   $271 million   of higher profits and   $427 million   in higher non-cash net expenses.  
  
   77 

Cash Used in Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities   increased     $44 million   from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an additional $1.6 billion in cash outflows for originations held for investment and a $41 million increase in restricted cash, which was largely offset by a $1.3 billion increase in proceeds from lease sales of leased vehicles, as we executed our first bulk lease sales to a third party in 2015, and a $280 million increase in proceeds from sales and repayment of receivables held for investment. 
  Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities   increased     $176 million   from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2014   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a $68 million increase in proceeds from stock option exercises, and an additional $30 million in net proceeds from borrowings. In addition, we did not pay any dividends during the first   nine   months of 2015, but paid $52 million during the first   nine   months of 2014. 
   
  Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  For information regarding the Company's contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to Note 11 -   Commitments and Contingencies   in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  We lease our headquarters in Dallas, Texas, our servicing centers in Texas and Colorado, and an operations facility in California under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through 2026. In October 2015, the Company executed a new non-cancelable operating lease for office space in Phoenix, Arizona. Other than described herein, there have been no material modifications to our contractual obligations since December 31, 2014. For additional information on our contractual obligations, refer to our 2014 Annual Report. 
   
  Risk Management Framework 
    
  Our risk management framework is overseen by our board of directors, our RC, our management risk committees, our executive management team, an independent risk management function, an internal audit function and all of our associates. The RC, along with our full board of directors, is responsible for establishing the governance over the risk management process, providing oversight in managing the aggregate risk position and reporting on the comprehensive portfolio of risk categories and the potential impact these risks can have on our risk profile. Our primary risks include, but are not limited to, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and model risk. For more information regarding our risk management framework, please refer to the Risk Management Framework section of our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  The risk inherent in our loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit quality and is affected by borrower-specific and economy-wide factors such as changes in employment. We manage this risk through our underwriting and credit approval guidelines and servicing policies and practices, as well as geographic and manufacturer concentration limits. 
  Our automated originations process reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management. Our robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides us with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary LFS using information such as FICO     , debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to our automated process, we maintain a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers. We generally tighten our underwriting requirements in times of greater economic uncertainty (including during the recent financial crisis) to compete in the market at loss and approval rates acceptable for meeting our required returns. We have also adjusted our underwriting standards to meet the requirements of our contracts such as the Chrysler agreement. In both cases, we have accomplished this by adjusting our risk-based pricing, the material components of which include interest rate, down payment, and loan-to-value. 
  We monitor early payment defaults and other potential indicators of dealer or customer fraud, and use the monitoring results to identify dealers who will be subject to more extensive stipulations when presenting customer applications, as well as dealers with whom we will not do business at all. 
  
   78 

Market Risk 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We measure and monitor interest rate risk on a monthly basis. We borrow money from a variety of market participants in order to provide loans and leases to our customers. Our gross interest rate spread, which is the different between the income we earn through the interest and finance charges on our finance receivables and lease contracts and the interest we pay on our funding, will be negatively affected if the expense incurred on our borrowings increases at a fast pace than the income generated by our assets. 
  Our Interest Rate Risk policy is designed to measure, monitor and manage the potential volatility in earnings stemming from changes in interest rates. We generate finance receivables which are predominantly fixed rate and borrow with a mix of fixed and variable rate funding. To the extent that our asset and liability re-pricing characteristics are not effectively matched, we may utilize interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swap agreements, to manage to our desired outcome. As of   September 30, 2015  , the notional value of our interest rate hedges was   $11.7 billion  . 
  We monitor our interest rate exposure by conducting interest rate sensitivity analysis. For purposes of reflecting a possible impact to earnings, we measure the twelve-month net interest income impact of an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel shift in prevailing interest rates. As of   September 30, 2015  , the twelve-month impact of a 100 basis point parallel increase in the interest rate curve would decrease our net interest income by $  41.8 million  . In addition to the sensitivity analysis on net interest income, we also measure Market Value of Equity (MVE) to view our interest rate risk position. MVE measures the change in value of Balance Sheet instruments in response to an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase, including and beyond the net interest income twelve-month horizon. As of   September 30, 2015  , the impact of a 100 basis point parallel increase in the interest rate curve would decrease our MVE by $  113.9 million  . 
  Collateral Risk 
  Our lease portfolio presents an inherent risk that residual values recognized upon lease termination will be lower than those used to price the contracts at inception. Although we have elected not to purchase residual value insurance at the present time, our residual risk is somewhat mitigated by our residual risk-sharing agreement with Chrysler. We also utilize industry data, including the ALG benchmark for residual values, and employ a team of individuals experienced in forecasting residual values.     
  Similarly, lower used vehicle prices also reduce the amount we can recover when remarketing repossessed vehicles that serve as collateral underlying loans. We manage this risk through loan-to-value limits on originations, monitoring of new and used vehicle values using standard industry guides, and active, targeted management of the repossession process. 
  We do not currently have material exposure to currency fluctuations or inflation. 
  Liquidity Risk 
  We view liquidity as integral to other key elements such as capital adequacy, asset quality and profitability. Because our debt is nearly entirely serviced by collections on consumer receivables, our primary liquidity risk relates to the ability to fund originations. We have a robust liquidity policy in place to manage this risk. The liquidity policy establishes the following guidelines: 

that we maintain at least eight external credit providers (as of   September 30, 2015  , we had twelve); 
                
    that we rely on Santander and affiliates for no more than 30% of our funding (as of   September 30, 2015  , Santander and affiliates provided   12%   of our funding); 
                
    that no single lender's commitment should comprise more than 33% of the overall committed external lines (as of   September 30, 2015  , the highest single lender's commitment was 22%); 
                
    that no more than 35% of our debt mature in the next six months and no more than 65% of our debt mature in the next twelve months (as of   September 30, 2015  , 8% and 13%, respectively, of our debt is scheduled to mature in these timeframes); and 
                
    that we maintain unused capacity of at least $6.0 billion, including flow agreements, in excess of our expected peak usage over the following twelve months (as of   September 30, 2015  , we had twelve-month rolling unused capacity of $9.1 billion). 
     Our liquidity policy also requires that our Asset and Liability Committee monitor many indicators, both market-wide and company-specific, to determine if action may be necessary to maintain our liquidity position. Our liquidity management tools  
  
   79 

include daily, monthly and twelve-month rolling cash requirements forecasts, monthly funding usage and availability reports, daily sources and uses reporting, structural liquidity risk exercises, and the establishment of liquidity contingency plans. We also perform quarterly stress tests in which we forecast the impact of various negative scenarios (alone and in combination), including reduced credit availability, higher funding costs, lower advance rates, lower customer interest rates, lower dealer discount rates, and higher credit losses. 
  We generally look for funding first from structured secured financings, second from third-party credit facilities, and last from Santander. We believe this strategy helps us avoid being overly reliant on Santander for funding. Additionally, we can reduce originations to significantly lower levels if necessary during times of limited liquidity. 
  We have established a qualified like-kind exchange program in order to defer tax liability on gains on sale of vehicle assets at lease termination. If we do not meet the safe harbor requirements of IRS Revenue Procedure 2003-39, we may be subject to large, unexpected tax liabilities, thereby generating immediate liquidity needs. We believe that our compliance monitoring policies and procedures are adequate to enable us to remain in compliance with the program requirements. 
  Operational Risk 
  We are exposed to loss that occurs in the process of carrying out our business activities. These relate to failures arising from inadequate or failed processes, failures in our people or systems, or from external events. Our operational risk management program encompasses risk event reporting, analysis, and remediation; key risk indicator monitoring; and risk profile assessments. It also includes unit, system, regression, load, performance and user acceptance testing for our IT programs. 
  To mitigate operational risk in regards to servicing practices, we maintain an extensive compliance, internal control, and monitoring framework, which includes the gathering of corporate control performance threshold indicators, Sarbanes-Oxley testing, monthly quality control tests, ongoing monitoring of compliance with all applicable regulations, internal control documentation and review of processes, and internal audits. We also utilize internal and external legal counsel for expertise when needed. All associates upon hire and annually receive comprehensive mandatory regulatory compliance training. In addition, the Board receives annual regulatory and compliance training. We use industry-leading call mining and other software solutions that assist us in analyzing potential breaches of regulatory requirements and customer service. Our call mining software analyzes all customer service calls, converting speech to text and mining for specific words and phrases that may indicate inappropriate comments by a representative.

    Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2015, we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, based on the additional analysis and other post-closing procedures performed, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial position, results of operations, capital position, and cash flows for the periods presented, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). 
    
  A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses: 
    
  Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities and Monitoring  
    
  We did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting related to the following areas: control environment, risk assessment, control activities and monitoring: 

Management did not effectively execute a strategy to hire and retain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in certain areas important to financial reporting. 
                
    The tone at the top was insufficient to ensure there were adequate mechanisms and oversight to ensure accountability for the performance of internal control over financial reporting responsibilities and to ensure corrective actions were appropriately prioritized and implemented in a timely manner.  
                
    There was not adequate management oversight of accounting and financial reporting activities in implementing certain accounting practices to conform to the Company s policies and GAAP. 
                
    There was not an adequate assessment of changes in risks by management that could significantly impact internal control over financial reporting or an adequate determination and prioritization of how those risks should be managed.  
                
    There was not adequate management oversight and identification of models material to financial reporting. 
                
    There were insufficiently documented Company accounting policies and insufficiently detailed Company procedures to put policies into effective action. 
                
    There was a lack of appropriate tone at the top in establishing an effective control owner risk and controls self-assessment process which contributed to a lack of clarity about ownership of risks assessments and control design and effectiveness. There was insufficient governance, oversight and monitoring of the credit loss allowance and accretion processes and a lack of defined roles and responsibilities in monitoring functions.   
       
  Application of Effective Interest Method for Accretion 
    
  The Company s policies and controls related to the methodology used for applying the effective interest rate method in accordance with GAAP, specifically as it relates the review of key assumptions over prepayment curves, pool segmentation and presentation in financial statements either were not designed appropriately or failed to operate effectively. Additionally the resources dedicated to the reviews were not sufficient to identify all relevant instances of non-compliance with policies and GAAP and did not sufficiently review supporting methodologies and practices to identify variances from the Company s policy and GAAP. 

81 

The Company reported a material weakness in control environment relating to inadequate management oversight of accounting and financial reporting activities in implementing certain accounting practices to conform to the Company s policies and GAAP, and insufficiently documented Company accounting policies and insufficiently detailed Company procedures to put policies into effective action which contributed to this material weakness. 
    
  This resulted in errors in the Company s application of the effective interest method for accreting discounts, which include discounts upon origination of the loan, subvention payments from manufacturers, and other origination costs on individually acquired retail installment contracts.  
    
  This material weakness relates to the following financial statement line items: finance receivables held for investment, net, finance receivables held for sale, net, interest on finance receivables and loans, provision for credit losses, investment gains and losses, net, and the related disclosures within Note 3 - Finance Receivables and Note 5 - Credit Loss Allowance and Credit Quality. 
    
  Methodology to Estimate Credit Loss Allowance  
    
  The Company s policies and controls related to the methodology used for estimating the credit loss allowance in accordance with GAAP, specifically as it relates to the calculation of impairment for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) separately from the general allowance on loans not classified as TDRs and the consideration of net discounts when estimating the allowance either were not designed appropriately or failed to operate effectively. Additionally the resources dedicated to the reviews were not sufficient to identify all relevant instances of non-compliance with policies and GAAP and did not sufficiently review supporting methodologies and practices to identify variances from the Company s policy and GAAP.  
    
  The Company reported a material weakness in control environment relating to inadequate management oversight of accounting and financial reporting activities in implementing certain accounting practices to conform to the Company s policies and GAAP, and insufficiently documented Company accounting policies and insufficiently detailed Company procedures to put policies into effective action which contributed to this material weakness.  
    
  This resulted in errors in the Company s methodology for determining the credit loss allowance, specifically not calculating impairment for TDRs separately from a general allowance on loans not classified as TDRs and inappropriately omitting the consideration of net discounts when estimating the allowance and recording charge-offs. 
    
  This material weakness relates to the following financial statement line items: the credit loss allowance, provision for credit losses, and the related disclosures within Note 3 - Finance Receivables and Note 5 - Credit Loss Allowance and Credit Quality. 
    
     Loans Modified as TDRs 
  The following controls over the identification of TDRs and inputs used to estimate TDR impairment did not operate effectively: 

Review controls of the TDR footnote disclosures and supporting information did not effectively identify that parameters used to query the loan data were incorrect. 
                
    A review of inputs used to estimate the expected and present value of cash flows of loans modified in TDRs did not identify errors in types of cash flows included and in the assumed timing and amount of defaults and did not identify that the discount rate was incorrect. 
       
  The Company reported a material weakness in control environment relating to inadequate management oversight of accounting and financial reporting activities in implementing certain accounting practices to conform to the Company s policies and GAAP,  and insufficiently documented Company accounting policies and insufficiently detailed Company procedures to put policies into effective action, as well as ineffective execution of a strategy to hire and retain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in certain areas important to financial reporting which contributed to this material weakness. 
    
  As a result, management determined that it had incorrectly identified the population of loans that should be classified as TDRs and, separately, had incorrectly estimated the impairment on these loans due to model input errors. 
    
  This material weakness relates to the following financial statement line items: the credit loss allowance and provision for credit losses, specifically for TDR loans, and the related disclosures within Note 3 - Finance Receivables and Note 5 - Credit Loss Allowance and Credit Quality. 
  
   82 

Development, Approval, and Monitoring of Models Used to Estimate the Credit Loss Allowance 
    
  Various deficiencies were identified in the credit loss allowance process related to review, monitoring and approval processes over models and model changes that aggregated to a material weakness. The following controls did not operate effectively: 

Review controls over data, inputs and assumptions in models used for estimating credit loss allowance and related model changes were not effective and management did not adequately challenge significant assumptions. 
                
    Review and approval controls over the development of new models to estimate credit loss allowance and related model changes were ineffective. 
                
    Adequate and comprehensive performance monitoring over related model output results was not performed and we did not maintain adequate model documentation. 
       
  The Company reported a material weakness in control environment relating to  inadequate assessment of changes in risks by management that could significantly impact internal control over financial reporting or determination and prioritization of how those risks should be managed and ineffective execution of a strategy to hire and retain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in certain areas important to financial reporting which contributed to this material weakness. 
    
  This material weakness relates to the following financial statement line items: the credit loss allowance, provision for credit losses, and the related disclosures within Note 3 - Finance Receivables and Note 5 - Credit Loss Allowance and Credit Quality. 
    
  Identification, Governance, and Monitoring of Models Used to Estimate Accretion 
    
  Various deficiencies were identified in the accretion process related to review, monitoring and governance processes over models that aggregated to a material weakness. The following controls did not operate effectively: 

Review controls over data, inputs and assumptions in models used for estimating accretion were not effective and management did not adequately challenge significant assumptions. 
                
    Adequate and comprehensive performance monitoring over related model output results was not performed and we did not maintain adequate model documentation. 
       
  The Company reported a material weakness in control environment relating to  inadequate assessment of changes in risks by management that could significantly impact internal control over financial reporting or determination and prioritization of how those risks should be managed and inadequate management oversight and identification of models material to financial reporting as well as ineffective execution of a strategy to hire and retain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in certain areas important to financial reporting which contributed to this material weakness. 
    
  This material weakness relates to the following financial statement line items: finance receivables held for investment, net, finance receivables held for sale, net, interest on finance receivables and loans, provision for credit losses, investment gains and losses, net, and the related disclosures within Note 3 - Finance Receivables and Note 5 - Credit Loss Allowance and Credit Quality. 
    
  Review of New, Unusual or Significant Transactions 
    
  Management identified an error in the accounting treatment of certain transactions related to separation agreements with the former Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Company. Specifically, controls over the review of new, unusual or significant transactions related to application of the appropriate accounting and tax treatment to this transaction in accordance with GAAP did not operate effectively in that management failed to detect as part of the review procedures that regulatory approval was prerequisite to recording the transaction and that approval had not been obtained prior to recording the transaction and therefore should have not been recorded.  
    
  The Company reported a material weakness in control environment relating to inadequate management oversight of accounting and financial reporting activities in implementing certain accounting practices to conform to the Company s policies and GAAP,  and ineffective execution of a strategy to hire and retain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level  
  
   83 

of knowledge, experience, and training in certain areas important to financial reporting which contributed to this material weakness. 
    
  This material weakness relates to the following financial statement line items: compensation expense, other liabilities, deferred tax liabilities, net, and additional paid in capital and the related disclosures within Note 16 - Shareholders' Equity. 
    
  Review of Financial Statement Disclosures 
    
  Management identified errors relating to financial statement disclosures. Specifically, the Company's controls over both the preparation and review of financial statement disclosures did not operate effectively to ensure complete, accurate, and proper presentation of the financial statement disclosures in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  The Company reported a material weakness in control environment relating to inadequate management oversight of accounting and financial reporting activities in implementing certain accounting practices to conform to the Company s policies and GAAP,  and ineffective execution of a strategy to hire and retain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in certain areas important to financial reporting which contributed to this material weakness. 
    
  This material weakness relates to various disclosures in the financial statements. 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows 
    
  Management identified an error in connection with the preparation and review of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows ("SCF"). Specifically, controls over the review of the impact of significant and unusual transactions on the classification and presentation of the SCF did not operate effectively, which led to the misclassification of cash flows between operating activities and investing activities in the preliminary June 30, 2015 SCF for certain proceeds from loan sales. The misclassification was corrected prior to the issuance of our June 30, 2015 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and had no impact to previously issued interim or annual financial statements of the Company. 
    
  The Company reported a material weakness in control environment relating to inadequate management oversight of accounting and financial reporting activities in implementing certain accounting practices to conform to the Company s policies and GAAP,  and ineffective execution of a strategy to hire and retain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in certain areas important to financial reporting which contributed to this material weakness.  
    
  Remediation Status of Reported Material Weaknesses 
    
  We are currently working to remediate the material weaknesses described above, including assessing the need for additional remediation steps and implementing additional measures to remediate the underlying causes that gave rise to the material weaknesses. 
    
  The following remediation steps are among the measures currently being implemented by the Company: 

The Company has begun efforts to hire additional personnel with the requisite skillsets in certain areas important to financial reporting.  
                
    The Company has established regular working group meetings, with appropriate oversight by management of both the Company and its parent to strengthen accountability for performance of internal control over financial reporting responsibilities and prioritization of corrective actions. 
                
    In conjunction with developing new credit loss allowance models and refining our loss forecasting methodology to be in compliance with GAAP, the Company also is enhancing its accounting documentation relating to credit loss allowance, to demonstrate how the Company s policies and procedures align with GAAP and produce a repeatable process.   
                
    Management is also in the process of performing a comprehensive review of current accounting practices to ensure compliance with the Company s accounting policies and GAAP, and to ensure sufficient specificity in procedures. Additionally, management will implement a recurring review by a team of qualified individuals.  
                
    Processes to identify, track, and report TDRs, that take into account changes to TDRs and new modification types, were enhanced and are being documented. 
     
   84 

A formal and comprehensive ongoing performance monitoring plan related to credit loss allowance with specific details around the monitoring activities performed to allow for repeatable and consistent testing is being developed. This plan is intended to be consistent with the Company s overarching model risk management policy and provide a consistent methodology for measuring performance across all models. 
                
    Management is ensuring that all models significant to financial reporting are subject to appropriate validation, documentation, and procedures. 
                
    Model documentation is being developed, or in some cases, enhanced to address model documentation gaps related to credit loss allowance and accretion models.  
                
    A framework and documentation is being developed to outline model security attributes/procedures for models related to credit loss allowance and models are being placed in an environment where access is restricted to authorized personnel and an audit trail is retained.  
                
    The Company is enhancing its Material Risk Program and Assessment and documentation. 
       
  While progress has been made to enhance processes, procedures and controls related to these areas, we are still in the process of developing and implementing these processes and procedures and testing these controls and believe additional time is required to complete development and implementation, and to demonstrate the sustainability of these procedures. We believe our remedial actions will be effective in remediating the material weaknesses and we will continue to devote significant time and attention to these remedial efforts. However, the material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial processes and procedures have been in place for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Accordingly, the material weaknesses are not remediated at September 30, 2015. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the third quarter ended September 30, 2015 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
    
  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
   
                 Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 

Reference should be made to Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference, for information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved, which supplements the discussion of legal proceedings set forth in Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
                 Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors. 

Our 2014 Annual Report includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors in Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors.  The information presented below should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in that Form 10-K. 
    
  Investing in our securities involves risk. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual 
  results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We may 
  amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC. 
    
  Lapses in internal controls including internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, liquidity and/or reputation. 
  We have identified control deficiencies in our financial reporting process as of September 30, 2015 that constitute material weaknesses, which contributed to the restatement of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in our previously filed Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. See Part I, Item 4 in this Form 10-Q/A. We have initiated certain measures, including the enhancement of our model framework and documentation process and increasing the number of employees on, and the expertise of, our financial reporting team, to remediate these weaknesses, and plan to implement additional appropriate measures as part of this effort. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully remediate our existing material weaknesses. Further, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer from other material weaknesses in the future. If we fail to remediate these material weaknesses or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, such failure could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial statements, limit our ability to raise capital and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, failure to remediate the material weaknesses or otherwise failing to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may also negatively impact our operating results and financial condition, impair our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, subject us to additional litigation and regulatory actions and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.

    Other Information 

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 
       
  Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating  
  
   86 

to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. 
    
  The following activities are disclosed in response to Section 13(r) with respect to affiliates of Santander UK within Santander. During the period covered by this report: 

Santander UK holds frozen savings accounts and one current account for two customers resident in the U.K. who are currently designated by the U.S. for terrorism. The accounts held by each customer were blocked after the customer s designation and have remained blocked and dormant throughout the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue generated by Santander UK on these accounts is negligible. 

An Iranian national, resident in the U.K., who is currently designated by the U.S. under the Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations and the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction ( NPWMD ) designation, holds a mortgage with Santander UK that was issued prior to any such designation. No further drawdown has been made (or would be allowed) under this mortgage although we continue to receive repayment installments. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, total revenue in connection with the mortgage was approximately  2,928 while net profits were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander UK. Santander UK does not intend to enter into any new relationships with this customer, and any disbursements will only be made in accordance with applicable sanctions. The same Iranian national also holds two investment accounts with Santander ISA Managers Limited. The accounts have remained frozen during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The investment returns are being automatically reinvested, and no disbursements have been made to the customer. Total revenue for Santander in connection with the investment accounts was approximately  161 while net profits in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander. 

In addition, during the third quarter of 2015 two additional Santander UK customers were designated. A UK national designated by the U.S. under the Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) sanctions program who is on the U.S. Specially Designated National (SDN) list holds a bank account which generated revenue of  183 during the third quarter of 2015. A stop was placed on the account. Net profits in the third quarter of 2015 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander. A second UK national also designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program and on the U.S. SDN list, held a bank account. No transactions were made in the third quarter of 2015 and the account is blocked and in arrears. 
       
  In addition, Santander has certain legacy export credits and performance guarantees with Bank Mellat, which are included in the U.S. Department of the Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. The Bank entered into two bilateral credit facilities in February 2000 in an aggregate principal amount of  25.9 million. Both credit facilities matured in 2012. In addition, in 2005 Santander participated in a syndicated credit facility for Bank Mellat of  15.5 million, which matured on July 6, 2015. As of September 30, 2015, Santander was owed  0.9 million not paid at maturity under this credit facility and 95% covered by official export credit agencies. 
    
  Santander has not been receiving payments from Bank Mellat under any of these credit facilities in recent years. Santander has been and expects to continue to be repaid any amounts due by official export credit agencies, which insure between 95% and 99% of the outstanding amounts under these credit facilities. No funds have been extended by Santander under these facilities since they were granted. 
    
  Santander also has certain legacy performance guarantees for the benefit of Bank Sepah and Bank Mellat (stand-by letters of credit to guarantee the obligations - either under tender documents or under contracting agreements - of contractors who participated in public bids in Iran) that were in place prior to April 27, 2007. However, should any of the contractors default in their obligations under the public bids, Santander would not be able to pay any amounts due to Bank Sepah or Bank Mellat because any such payments would be frozen pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No. 961/2010. 
    
  In the aggregate, all of the transactions described above resulted in approximately  12,000 gross revenues and approximately  44,000 net loss to Santander in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, all of which resulted from the performance of export credit agencies rather than any Iranian entity. Santander has undertaken significant steps to withdraw from the Iranian market such as closing its representative office in Iran and ceasing all banking activities therein, including correspondent relationships, deposit taking from Iranian entities and issuing export letters of credit, except for the legacy transactions described above. Santander is not contractually permitted to cancel these arrangements without either (i) paying the guaranteed amount - which payment would be frozen as explained above (in the case of the performance guarantees), or (ii) forfeiting the  
  
   87 

outstanding amounts due to it (in the case of the export credits). As such, Santander intends to continue to provide the guarantees and hold these assets in accordance with company policy and applicable laws.

  CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO RULE 13a-14(a) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT, AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
  I, Jason A. Kulas, President and Chief Executive Officer of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc., certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3.
