Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

1  . Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Description of the Business     MPLX LP is a diversified, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by MPC. MPLX LP and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Partnership ) are engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs; and the transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products. On December 4, 2015, the Partnership completed a merger with MarkWest (the  MarkWest Merger ). See Note   3   for additional information. 
    
  The Partnership s business consists of   two   segments based on the nature of services it offers: Logistics and Storage ( L S ) focused on crude oil and refined petroleum products and Gathering and Processing ( G P ) focused on natural gas and NGLs. See Note   9   for additional information regarding operations. 
    
  Basis of Presentation     The Partnership s consolidated financial statements include all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. For non-wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, the interests owned by third parties, including MPC, have been recorded as   Noncontrolling interest   in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Intercompany investments, accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Partnership s investments in which the Partnership exercises significant influence but does not control and does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for using the equity method. The Partnership s investments in a VIE in which the Partnership exercises significant influence but does not control and is not the primary beneficiary are also accounted for using the equity method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Partnership have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reclassifications have been made in connection with the MarkWest Merger and HSM acquisition to conform to current classifications. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations or retained earnings. 
    
  Effective March 31, 2016, the Partnership acquired MPC s inland marine business. This business is operated through HSM and the related assets, liabilities and results of operations are collectively referred to as the  Predecessor.  The acquisition from MPC was a transfer between entities under common control. As an entity under common control with MPC, the Partnership recorded the assets acquired from MPC on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at MPC s historical basis instead of fair value. Transfers of businesses between entities under common control require prior periods to be retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes of MPLX LP have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the assets acquired from MPC prior to the effective date of the acquisition. See Note   3   for additional information regarding the HSM acquisition. The accompanying financial statements and related notes present the combined financial position, results of operations, cash flows and equity of the Predecessor at historical cost. The financial statements of the Predecessor have been prepared from the separate records maintained by MPC and may not necessarily be indicative of the conditions or the results of operations that would have existed if the Predecessor had been operated as an unaffiliated entity. 
    
  Based on the terms of certain natural gas gathering, transportation and processing agreements, the Partnership is considered to be the lessor under several implicit operating lease arrangements in accordance with GAAP. The Partnership s primary implicit lease operations relate to a natural gas gathering agreement in the Marcellus shale for which it earns a fixed-fee for providing gathering services to a single producer customer using a dedicated gathering system. As the gathering system is expanded, the fixed-fee charged to the producer is adjusted to include the additional gathering assets in the lease. Other significant implicit leases relate to a natural gas processing agreement in the Marcellus shale and a natural gas processing agreement in the Southern Appalachia region for which the Partnership earns minimum monthly fees for providing processing services to a single producer using a dedicated processing plant. Revenues and costs related to the portion of the revenue earned under these contracts considered to be implicit leases are recorded as   Rental income   and   Rental cost of sales  , respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Similarly, the Partnership is considered to be the lessor under implicit operating lease arrangements with MPC in accordance with GAAP. The Partnership s primary implicit lease operations with MPC relate to the transportation services agreement between HSM and MPC. Revenue related to this agreement is recorded as   Rental income-related parties   on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The rental cost of sales related to the HSM implicit lease is depreciation of the HSM assets. All other services are provided to MPC on an as-needed basis and recorded as   Service revenue-related parties   on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  These interim consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Partnership s management, these statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. These interim consolidated financial statements, including the notes, have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to interim period financial statements and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 
  
   7 

Table of Contents  

These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by the Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on May 20, 2016. The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
    
  In preparing the Consolidated Statements of Equity, net income attributable to MPLX LP is allocated to preferred unitholders based on a fixed distribution schedule, as discussed in Note   8  , and subsequently allocated to the general partner and limited partner unitholders. Distributions, although earned, are not accrued for until declared. However, when distributions related to the incentive distribution rights are made, earnings equal to the amount of those distributions are first allocated to the general partner before the remaining earnings are allocated to the limited partner unitholders based on their respective ownership percentages. The allocation of net income attributable to MPLX LP for purposes of calculating net income per limited partner unit is described in Note   6  . 

2  . Accounting Standards 
    
  Recently Adopted 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments related to business combinations. This accounting standard update requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The change was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Partnership recognized measurement period adjustments during the first and second quarters of 2016 on a cumulative prospective basis as additional analysis was completed on the preliminary purchase price allocation for the acquisition of MarkWest. See Notes   3   and   16   for further discussion and detail related to these measurement period adjustments. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update requiring that the earnings of transferred net assets prior to the dropdown date of the net assets to a master limited partnership be allocated entirely to the general partner when calculating earnings per unit under the two class method. Under this guidance, previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners will not change as a result of a dropdown transaction. The change was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Retrospective application is required. The Partnership adopted this accounting standard update in the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update clarifying whether a customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as an acquisition of a software license or as a service arrangement by providing characteristics that a cloud computing arrangement must have in order to be accounted for as a software license acquisition. The change was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Retrospective or prospective application is allowed. The Partnership adopted this accounting standard update prospectively in the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update making targeted changes to the current consolidation guidance. The accounting standard update changes the considerations related to substantive rights, related parties, and decision making fees when applying the VIE consolidation model and eliminates certain guidance for limited partnerships and similar entities under the voting interest consolidation model. The change was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Partnership adopted this accounting standard update in the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
    
  Not Yet Adopted 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update related to the classification of certain cash flows. This accounting standard update provides classification solutions for eight different cash flow items including: debt prepayment/extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The change is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Partnership does not expect application of this accounting standard update to have a material impact on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Table of Contents  

In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update related to the accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments. The guidance requires that for most financial assets, losses are based on an expected loss approach which includes estimates of losses over the life of exposure that considers historical, current and forecasted information. Expanded disclosures related to the methods used to estimate the losses as well as a specific disaggregation of balances for financial assets are also required. The change is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Partnership does not expect application of this accounting standard update to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on the accounting for employee share-based payments. This accounting standard update requires the recognition of income tax effects of awards through the income statement when awards vest or are settled. It will also increase the amount an employer can withhold for tax purposes without triggering liability accounting. Lastly, it allows employers to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The changes are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Partnership does not expect application of this accounting standard update to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on lease accounting. This accounting standard update requires lessees to record virtually all leases on their balance sheets. The accounting standard update also requires expanded disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The change will be effective on a modified retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Partnership is in the process of determining the impact of the accounting standard update on the consolidated financial statements and expects such impact to be material. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update requiring unconsolidated equity investments, not accounted for under the equity method, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The accounting standard update also requires the use of the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and the separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form on the balance sheet and accompanying notes. The accounting standard update eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost. Lastly, the accounting standard update requires separate presentation in other comprehensive income of the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when electing to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The changes are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only for guidance regarding presentation of the liability s credit risk. The Partnership is in the process of determining the impact of the accounting standard update on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update requiring management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Management is required to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance of the financial statements. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether management s plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt. The change will be effective for the first fiscal period ending after December 15, 2016, and for fiscal periods and interim periods thereafter with early application permitted. The adoption of this accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Partnership s financial reporting. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an initial accounting standard update for revenue recognition for contracts with customers. The guidance in the accounting standard update states that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service. Recognition of the revenue will involve a multiple step approach including identifying the contract, identifying the separate performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the price to the performance obligations and then recognizing the revenue as the obligations are satisfied. Additional disclosures will be required to provide adequate information to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of reported revenues and revenues expected to be recognized. The change will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted no earlier than January 1, 2017. The Partnership is in the process of determining the impact of the accounting standard update on the consolidated financial statements.

3  . Acquisitions 
    
  Acquisition of Hardin Street Marine LLC  
    
  On March 14, 2016, the Partnership entered into a Membership Interests Contribution Agreement (the  Contribution Agreement ) with MPLX GP LLC ( MPLX GP ), MPLX Logistics Holdings LLC and MPC Investment LLC ( MPC Investment ), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC, related to the acquisition of HSM, MPC s inland marine business, from MPC. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the transaction was valued at   $600 million   consisting of a fixed number of common units and general partner units of   22,534,002   and   459,878  , respectively. The general partner units maintain MPC s two percent general partner interest in the Partnership. The acquisition closed on   March 31, 2016   and the fair value of the common units and general partner units issued was   $669 million   and   $14 million  , respectively, as recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Equity. MPC agreed to waive distributions in the first quarter of 2016 on MPLX LP common units issued in connection with this transaction. MPC did not receive general partner distributions or incentive distribution rights that would have otherwise accrued on such MPLX LP common units with respect to the first quarter distributions. The value of these waived distributions was   $15 million  . 
    
  The inland marine business, comprised of   18   tow boats and   205   barges which transport light products, heavy oils, crude oil, renewable fuels, chemicals and feedstocks in the Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, accounted for nearly   60 percent   of the total volumes MPC shipped by inland marine vessels as of March 31, 2016. The Partnership accounts for HSM as a reporting unit of the L S segment.

The Partnership retrospectively adjusted the historical financial results for all periods to include HSM as required for transactions between entities under common control. For the previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheets retrospectively adjusted for the acquisition of HSM, see the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as updated by the Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on May 20, 2016. The following table presents the Partnership s previously reported unaudited Consolidated Statement of Income, retrospectively adjusted for the acquisition of HSM:

Purchase of MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. 
    
  On   December 4, 2015  , a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership merged with MarkWest. Each common unit of MarkWest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the MarkWest Merger was converted into a right to receive   1.09   common units representing limited partner interests in MPLX LP, plus a one-time cash payment of   $6.20   per unit. Each Class B unit of MarkWest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the MarkWest Merger was converted into the right to receive one Class B unit of MPLX LP. Each Class B unit of MPLX LP will convert into   1.09   common units of MPLX LP and the right to receive   $6.20   in cash, and the conversion of the Class B units will occur in equal installments, the first of which occurred on   July 1, 2016   and the second of which will occur on   July 1, 2017  . MPC contributed approximately   $1.3 billion   of cash to the Partnership to pay the aggregate cash consideration to MarkWest unitholders, without receiving any new equity in exchange. At closing, MPC made a payment of   $1.2 billion   to MarkWest common unitholders and the remaining   $50 million   is payable in equal amounts, the first of which was paid in July 2016 and the second of which will be  
  
   13 

paid in July 2017, in connection with the conversion of the remaining outstanding Class B units to MPLX LP common units. The Partnership s financial results reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the acquisition. 
    
  The components of the fair value of consideration transferred are as follows: 

The following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation. Subsequent to   December 31, 2015  , additional analysis was completed and adjustments were made to the preliminary purchase price allocation as noted in the table below. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed at the acquisition date as of   September 30, 2016  , are as follows:   

Adjustments to the preliminary purchase price stem mainly from additional information obtained by management in the first and second quarters of 2016 about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, including updates to forecasted employee benefit costs, maintenance capital expenditures and completion of certain valuations to determine the underlying fair value of certain acquired assets. The adjustment to intangibles mainly relates to a misstatement in the original preliminary purchase price allocation. The correction of the error resulted in a   $68 million   reduction to the carrying value of goodwill and an offsetting increase of   $64 million   in intangibles and   $2 million   in each of equity method investments and property, plant and equipment. Management concluded that the correction of the error is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements of all periods presented. As further discussed in Note   16  , in the first quarter of 2016 the Partnership recorded a goodwill impairment charge based on the implied fair value of goodwill as of the interim impairment analysis date. During the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership finalized its analysis of the final purchase price allocation. The completion of the purchase price allocation resulted in a refinement of the impairment expense recorded, as more fully discussed in Note   16  . 

14 

The increase to the fair value of intangibles and property, plant and equipment noted above resulted in additional amortization and depreciation expense of approximately   $1 million   recognized for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , in   Depreciation and amortization   in the Consolidated Statements of Income, that would have been recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, had the fair value adjustments been recorded as of December 4, 2015. The increase in the fair value of equity investments above would not have had a material effect on the income from equity method investments had the fair value adjustment been recorded as of December 4, 2015. 
    
  The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of   $2.2 billion   of goodwill in three reporting units within the Partnership s G P segment, substantially all of which is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill represents the complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of MarkWest and MPLX LP that will provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. 
    
  The fair value of the common units issued was determined on the basis of the closing market price of the Partnership s units as of the effective time of the transaction and is considered a Level 1 measurement. The fair value of the Class B units issued was determined based on reference to the value of the common units, adjusted for a lack of distributions prior to their stated conversion dates, and is considered a Level 2 measurement. The fair values of the long-term debt and SMR liabilities were determined as of the acquisition date using the methods discussed in Note   13  . 
    
  The fair value of the equity method investments was determined based on applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, to the Partnership s equity method investments on an individual basis. Key assumptions include discount rates of   9.4 percent   to   11.1 percent   and terminal values based on the Gordon growth method to capitalize the cash flows, using a   2.5 percent   long-term growth rate. Intangibles represent customer contracts and related relationships. The fair value of the intangibles was determined based on applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which is an income approach. Key assumptions include attrition rates by reporting unit ranging from   5.0 percent   to   10.0 percent   and discount rates by reporting unit ranging from   11.5 percent   to   12.8 percent  . The fair value of property, plant and equipment was determined primarily based on the cost approach. Key assumptions include inputs to the valuation methodology such as recent purchases of similar items and published data for similar items. Components were adjusted for economic and functional obsolescence, location, normal useful lives and capacity (if applicable). The fair value measurements for equity method investments, intangibles, and property, plant and equipment are based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and, therefore, represent Level 3 measurements. 
    
  The amounts of revenue and income from operations associated with MarkWest are not included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the period ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents consolidated results assuming the MarkWest Merger occurred on January 1, 2014. 

The unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments primarily to align accounting policies, adjust depreciation expense to reflect the fair value of property, plant and equipment, increase amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets and adjust interest expense related to the fair value of MarkWest s long-term debt, as well as the related income tax effects.   The pro forma financial information does not give effect to potential synergies that could result from the acquisition and is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations. 
    
  MarkWest has a   60 percent   legal ownership interest in MarkWest Utica EMG. MarkWest Utica EMG s inability to fund its planned activities without subordinated financial support qualify it as a VIE. The financing structure for MarkWest Utica EMG at its inception resulted in a de-facto agent relationship under which MarkWest was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of MarkWest Utica EMG. Therefore, MarkWest consolidated MarkWest Utica EMG in its historical financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2015, based on economic conditions and other pertinent factors, the accounting for its investment in  
  
   15 

MarkWest Utica EMG was re-assessed. As of   December 4, 2015  , the entity has been deconsolidated. For purposes of this pro forma financial information, MarkWest Utica EMG has been consolidated for the period prior to the acquisition consistent with its treatment in the historical periods presented. 
    
  A summary of the amounts included in the historical financial statements of MarkWest related to MarkWest Utica EMG are as follows: 

EMG Utica, LLC ( EMG Utica ), a joint venture partner in MarkWest Utica EMG, received a special non-cash allocation of income of approximately   $11 million   and   $32 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . See Note   4   for a description of the transaction and its impact on the financial statements. Net income of MarkWest would not have changed had MarkWest Utica EMG been deconsolidated for the period ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Investment in Pipeline Company 
    
  The Partnership currently expects to participate in a joint venture with Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( Enbridge Energy Partners ) to acquire a   9.1875   percent indirect ownership interest in the Dakota Access Pipeline ( DAPL ) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company Pipeline ( ETCOP ) projects, collectively referred to as the Bakken Pipeline system, from Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. ( ETP ) and Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P. ( SXL ) for   $500 million  . Furthermore, MPC expects to become a committed shipper on the Bakken Pipeline system under terms of an on-going open season. The acquisition remains subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  The Bakken Pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of   470,000   barrels per day of crude oil from the Bakken/ Three Forks production area in North Dakota to the Midwest through Patoka, Illinois and ultimately to the Gulf Coast. 
    
  ETP and SXL collectively own a   75   percent interest in each of the two joint ventures that are developing the Bakken Pipeline system. MPLX LP and Enbridge Energy Partners will participate in a new joint venture to acquire   49   percent of ETP and SXL s   75   percent indirect interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. MPLX LP will own   25   percent of this new joint venture with Enbridge, which results in a   9.1875   percent indirect ownership interest in the Bakken pipeline system. The Partnership expects to account for the investment as part of the L S segment using the equity method of accounting. 

4  . Equity Method Investments 
    
  MarkWest Utica EMG  
    
  Effective January 1, 2012, MarkWest Utica Operating Company, LLC ( Utica Operating ), a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary of MarkWest, and EMG Utica (together the  Members ) executed agreements to form a joint venture, MarkWest Utica EMG, to develop significant natural gas gathering, processing and NGL fractionation, transportation and marketing infrastructure in eastern Ohio. The related limited liability company agreement has been amended from time to time (the limited liability company agreement as currently in effect is referred to as the  Amended LLC Agreement ). The aggregate funding commitment of EMG Utica was   $950 million   (the  Minimum EMG Investment ). Thereafter, Utica Operating was required to fund, as needed,   100 percent   of future capital for MarkWest Utica EMG until such time as the aggregate capital that had been contributed by the Members reached   $2 billion  , which occurred prior to the MarkWest Merger. Until such time as the investment balances of Utica Operating and EMG Utica are in the ratio of   70 percent   and   30 percent  , respectively (such time being referred to as the  Second Equalization Date ), EMG Utica will have the right, but not the obligation, to fund up to   10 percent   of each capital call for MarkWest Utica EMG, and Utica Operating will be required to fund all remaining capital not elected to be funded by EMG Utica. After the Second Equalization Date, Utica Operating and EMG Utica will have the right, but not the obligation, to fund their pro rata portion (based on their respective investment balances) of any additional required capital and may also fund additional capital that the other party elects not to fund. As of   September 30, 2016  , EMG Utica has  
  
   16 

contributed approximately   $999 million   and Utica Operating has contributed approximately   $1.5 billion   to MarkWest Utica EMG. 
    
  Under the Amended LLC Agreement, after EMG Utica has contributed more than   $500 million   to MarkWest Utica EMG and prior to December 31, 2016, EMG Utica s investment balance will also be increased by a quarterly special non-cash allocation of income ( Preference Amount ) that is based upon the amount of capital contributed by EMG Utica in excess of   $500 million  . No Preference Amount will accrue to EMG Utica s investment balance after December 31, 2016. EMG Utica received a special non-cash allocation of income of approximately   $4 million   and approximately   $12 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Under the Amended LLC Agreement, Utica Operating will continue to receive   60 percent   of cash generated by MarkWest Utica EMG that is available for distribution until the earlier of December 31, 2016 and the date on which Utica Operating s investment balance equals   60 percent   of the aggregate investment balances of the Members. After the earlier of those dates, cash generated by MarkWest Utica EMG that is available for distribution will be allocated to the Members in proportion to their respective investment balances. As of   September 30, 2016  , Utica Operating s investment balance in MarkWest Utica EMG was approximately   56   percent. 
    
  MarkWest Utica EMG is deemed to be a VIE. As of the date of the MarkWest Merger, Utica Operating is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary due to EMG Utica s voting rights on significant matters. The Partnership s portion of MarkWest Utica EMG s net assets, which was   $2.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , is reported under the caption   Equity method investments   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see basis differential discussion below). The Partnership s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with MarkWest Utica EMG includes its equity investment, any additional capital contribution commitments and any operating expenses incurred by the subsidiary operator in excess of its compensation received for the performance of the operating services. The Partnership did not provide any financial support to MarkWest Utica EMG that it was not contractually obligated to provide during the period ended   September 30, 2016  . The Partnership receives management fee revenue for engineering and construction, administrative and personnel services ( Operational Service revenue ) for operating MarkWest Utica EMG. The amount of Operational Service revenue related to MarkWest Utica EMG for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $5 million   and   $12 million  , respectively, and is reported as   Other income-related parties   in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  Ohio Gathering 
    
  Ohio Gathering is a subsidiary of MarkWest Utica EMG and is engaged in providing natural gas gathering services in the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio. Ohio Gathering is a joint venture between MarkWest Utica EMG and Summit Midstream Partners, LLC ( Summit ). As Ohio Gathering is a subsidiary of MarkWest Utica EMG, which is accounted for as an equity method investment, the Partnership reports its portion of Ohio Gathering s net assets as a component of its investment in MarkWest Utica EMG. The Partnership receives Operational Service revenue for operating Ohio Gathering. The amount of Operational Service revenue related to Ohio Gathering for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $5 million   and   $12 million  , respectively, and is reported as   Other income-related parties   in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
           
  Ohio Condensate 
           
  In December 2013, MarkWest formed MarkWest Utica EMG Condensate L.L.C. ( Utica Condensate ) for the purpose of engaging in wellhead condensate gathering, stabilization, terminalling, storage and marketing in Ohio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership owned   100 percent   of Utica Condensate. Utica Condensate s business is conducted solely through its subsidiary, Ohio Condensate, which is a joint venture between Utica Condensate and Summit. As of   September 30, 2016  , Utica Condensate owned   60 percent   of Ohio Condensate. The Partnership accounts for Ohio Condensate, which is a VIE, as an equity method investment as MPLX LP exercises significant influence, but does not control Ohio Condensate and is not its primary beneficiary due to Summit s voting rights on significant matters. The Partnership s portion of Ohio Condensate s net assets are reported under the caption   Equity method investments   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Partnership receives Operational Service revenue for operating Ohio Condensate. The amount of Operational Service revenue related to Ohio Condensate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1 million   and   $3 million  , respectively, and is reported as   Other income-related parties   in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

17 

Summarized financial information for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for equity method investments is as follows: 

Summarized balance sheet information as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for equity method investments is as follows:  

(1) 
    MarkWest Utica EMG s noncurrent assets includes its investment in its subsidiary Ohio Gathering, which does not appear elsewhere in this table. The investment was   $788 million   and   $781 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
              (2) 
    Income (loss) from equity method investments includes the impact of any basis differential amortization or accretion. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of the Partnership s equity method investments was   $1.1 billion   higher than the underlying net assets of the investees. This basis difference is being amortized or accreted into net income over the remaining estimated useful lives of the underlying net assets, except for   $459 million   of excess related to goodwill. During the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership completed its purchase price allocation related to the MarkWest Merger. As a result, a portion of the basis differential related to goodwill for Utica EMG was reclassified to fixed assets and will be amortized prospectively. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, forecasts for Ohio Condensate were reduced to align with updated forecasts for customer requirements. As the operator of that entity responsible for maintaining its financial records, the Partnership completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of June 30, 2016, in accordance with ASC Topic 360, to determine the potential fixed asset impairment charge. The resulting fixed asset impairment charge recorded within Ohio Condensate s financial statements was   $96 million  . Based on the Partnership s   60 percent   ownership of Ohio Condensate, approximately   $58 million   was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in   Income (loss) from equity method investments   on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  The Partnership s investment in Ohio Condensate, which was established at fair value in connection with the MarkWest Merger, exceeded its proportionate share of the underlying net assets. Therefore, in conjunction with the ASC Topic 360 impairment analysis, the Partnership completed an equity method impairment analysis in accordance with ASC Topic 323 to determine the potential additional equity method impairment charge to be recorded on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements resulting from an other-than-temporary impairment. As a result, an additional impairment charge of approximately   $31 million   was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in   Income (loss) from equity method investments   on the accompanying  
  
   18 

Consolidated Statements of Income, which eliminated the basis differential established in connection with the MarkWest Merger. 
    
  The fair value of Ohio Condensate and its underlying fixed assets was determined based upon applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management s best estimates of the expected future results using a probability weighted average set of cash flow forecasts and a discount rate of   11.2 percent  . An increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points would have resulted in an additional charge of   $1 million   on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As such, the fair value of the Ohio Condensate equity method investment and its underlying fixed assets represents a Level 3 measurement. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.

  The Partnership has various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with MPC. Under these agreements, the Partnership provides pipeline transportation and storage services to MPC, and MPC has committed to provide the Partnership with minimum quarterly throughput and storage volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of butane.  
    
  In addition, the Partnership is party to a loan agreement with MPC Investment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC. Under the terms of the agreement, MPC Investment will make a loan or loans to the Partnership on a revolving basis as requested by the Partnership and as agreed to by MPC Investment, in an amount or amounts that do not result in the aggregate principal amount of all loans outstanding exceeding   $500 million   at any one time. The entire unpaid principal amount of the loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts (if any), shall become due and payable on   December 4, 2020  . MPC Investment may demand payment of all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts (if any), at any time prior to   December 4, 2020  . Borrowings under the loan will bear interest at   LIBOR plus 1.50 percent  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership borrowed   $2.2 billion   and repaid   $2.2 billion  , resulting in   no   outstanding balance at   September 30, 2016  . Borrowings were at an average interest rate of   1.94 percent  , per annum. For additional information regarding the Partnership s commercial and other agreements with MPC, see Item 1. Business in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

  On January 1, 2015, HSM employees were transferred to Marathon Petroleum Logistics Services LLC ("MPLS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC, and HSM and MPLS entered into an employee services agreement. Under the agreement, HSM reimburses MPLS for employee benefit expenses along with certain operational and management services provided in support of HSM s areas of operation. The employee services agreement has an initial term of   six   years and automatically renews for   two   additional renewal terms of   five   years each unless either party provides the other party with written notice of its intent to terminate at least 12 months prior to the end of the then-current term.  
    
  Related Party Transactions 
    
  Sales to related parties were as follows:  

(1) 
    For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were   $13 million   and   $25 million   respectively, of additional product sales to MPC that net to zero within the consolidated financial statements, as the transactions are recorded net due to the terms of the agreements under which such product was sold. 
       
  Related party sales to MPC consist of crude oil and refined products pipeline transportation services based on regulated tariff rates, storage services based on contracted rates and transportation services provided by HSM. Under the Partnership s pipeline transportation services agreements, if MPC fails to transport its minimum throughput volumes during any quarter, then MPC will pay the Partnership a deficiency payment equal to the volume of the deficiency multiplied by the tariff rate then in effect. The deficiency amounts are recorded as   Deferred revenue-related parties  . MPC may then apply the amount of any such deficiency payments as a credit for volumes transported on the applicable pipeline system in excess of its minimum volume commitment during the following four or eight quarters under the terms of the applicable transportation services agreement. The Partnership recognizes revenues for the deficiency payments when credits are used for volumes transported in excess of minimum quarterly volume commitments, when it becomes impossible to physically transport volumes necessary to utilize the credits or upon the expiration of the credits. The use or expiration of the credits is a decrease in   Deferred revenue-related parties  .

6  . Net Income (Loss) Per Limited Partner Unit 
    
  Net income (loss) per unit applicable to common limited partner units and to subordinated limited partner units is computed by dividing the respective limited partners  interest in net income (loss) attributable to MPLX LP by the weighted average number of common units and subordinated units outstanding. Because the Partnership has more than one class of participating securities, it uses the two-class method when calculating the net income (loss) per unit applicable to limited partners. The classes of participating securities include common units, subordinated units, general partner units, preferred units, certain equity-based compensation awards and incentive distribution rights ( IDRs ). 
    
  As discussed in Note   1  , the HSM acquisition was a transfer between entities under common control. As an entity under common control with MPC, prior periods were retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, the prior period earnings have been allocated to the general partner and do not affect the net income (loss) per unit calculation. The earnings for HSM will be included in the net income (loss) per unit calculation prospectively as described above. 
    
  As discussed further in Note   7  , the subordinated units, all of which were owned by MPC, were converted into common units during the third quarter of 2015. For purposes of calculating net income (loss) per unit, the subordinated units were treated as if they converted to common units on July 1, 2015. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership had dilutive potential common units consisting of certain equity-based compensation awards and Class B units. Diluted net income (loss) per limited partner unit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is the same as basic net income (loss) per limited partner unit since the inclusion of any potential common units would have been anti-dilutive. Potential common units omitted from the diluted earnings per unit calculation for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   8 million  .

  Units Outstanding       The Partnership had   348,489,049   common units outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . Of that number,   86,619,313   were owned by MPC, which also owned the   two percent   general partner interest, represented by   7,193,467   general partner units.  
    
  Following payment of the cash distribution for the second quarter of 2015, the requirements for the conversion of all subordinated units were satisfied under the partnership agreement. As a result, effective   August 17, 2015  , the   36,951,515   subordinated units owned by MPC were converted into common units on a one-for-one basis and thereafter participate on terms equal with all other common units in distributions of available cash. The conversion did not impact the amount of the cash distributions paid by the Partnership or the total units outstanding.

Reorganization Transactions     On September 1, 2016, the Partnership and various affiliates initiated a series of reorganization transactions in order to simplify the Partnership s ownership structure and its financial and tax reporting requirements (the "Class A Reorganization"). In connection with these transactions, the issued and outstanding MPLX LP Class A units, all of which were held by MarkWest Hydrocarbon, were either distributed to or purchased by MPC in exchange for   $84 million   in cash,   21,401,137   MPLX LP common units and   436,758   MPLX general partner units. Following these initial transactions, all of the MPLX LP Class A units were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in MPLX LP. MPC also contributed   $141 million   to facilitate the repayment of intercompany debt between MarkWest Hydrocarbon and MarkWest. As a result of these transactions, the MPLX LP Class A units were eliminated, are no longer outstanding and no longer participate in distributions of cash from the Partnership. Cash that is derived from or attributable to MarkWest Hydrocarbon s operations is now treated in the same manner as cash derived from or attributable to other operations of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. 
    
  ATM Program     On   August 4, 2016  , the Partnership entered into a second amended and restated distribution agreement providing for the continuous issuance of up to an aggregate of   $1.2 billion   of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings (such continuous offering program, or at-the-market program, referred to as the  ATM Program ). The Partnership expects the net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program will be used for general partnership purposes including repayment of debt and funding for acquisitions, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the sale of common units under the ATM Program generated net proceeds of approximately   $499 million  . 
    
  The changes in the number of units outstanding from   December 31, 2015   through   September 30, 2016   are summarized below: 

(2) 
    As a result of the unit-based compensation awards issued during the period, MPLX GP contributed less than   $1 million   in exchange for   810   general partner units to maintain its   two percent   general partner interest. 
              (3) 
    As a result of common units issued under the ATM Program during the period, MPLX GP contributed   $11 million   in exchange for   361,732   general partner units to maintain its   two percent   general partner interest. 
              (4) 
    See Note   3   for information regarding the HSM acquisition. 
              (5) 
    As a result of the Class B units converted to common units during the period, MPLX GP contributed less than   $1 million   in exchange for   7,330   general partner units to maintain its   two percent   general partner interest. 
              (6) 
    As a result of the Class A Reorganization,   7 million   common units were acquired by MPC that represents the common units received by MPC on the exchange of the MPLX LP Class A units less the units redeemed in the distribution of MPLX Holdings Inc., including the MPLX LP Class A units. Additionally, MPLX LP transferred common units representing a   two percent   ownership interest of MPLX Holdings Inc. to MPLX GP in exchange for   436,758   MPLX general partner units held by MPLX GP, as discussed above. 
       
  Issuance of Additional Securities           The partnership agreement authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number of additional partnership securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions determined by the general partner without the approval of the unitholders.

Net Income Allocation           In preparing the Consolidated Statements of Equity, net (loss) income attributable to MPLX LP is allocated to preferred unitholders based on a fixed distribution schedule, as discussed in Note   8  , and subsequently allocated to remaining unitholders in accordance with their respective ownership percentages. However, when distributions related to the incentive distribution rights are made, earnings equal to the amount of those distributions are first allocated to the general partner before the remaining earnings are allocated to the unitholders based on their respective ownership percentages. The following table presents the allocation of the general partner s interest in net income attributable to MPLX LP: 

Cash distributions           The partnership agreement sets forth the calculation to be used to determine the amount and priority of cash distributions that the common and subordinated unitholders and general partner will receive. In accordance with the partnership agreement, on   October 25, 2016  , the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of   $0.5150   per unit, resulting in total distributions of   $233 million  . These distributions will be paid on   November 14, 2016   to unitholders of record on   November 4, 2016  . 
    
  The allocation of total quarterly cash distributions to preferred, general and limited partners is as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Partnership s distributions are declared subsequent to quarter end; therefore, the following table represents total cash distributions applicable to the period in which the distributions were earned. 

8  . Redeemable Preferred Units  
    
  Private Placement of Preferred Units         On May 13, 2016, MPLX completed the private placement of approximately   30.8 million     6.5 percent   Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the "Preferred Units") for a cash purchase price of   $32.50   per unit. The aggregate net proceeds of approximately   $984 million   from the sale of the Preferred Units was used for capital expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes. 

27 

Table of Contents  

The Preferred Units rank senior to all common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation. The holders of the Preferred Units are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly distributions equal to   $0.528125   per unit commencing for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of issuance. Following the second anniversary of the issuance of the Preferred Units, the holders of the Preferred Units will receive as a distribution the greater of   $0.528125   per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to common units. Since the Preferred Unit distribution was declared subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2016, the distribution was not accrued to the Preferred Unit holders  capital account. For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Preferred Units received an earned aggregate cash distribution of   $9 million  , based on the quarterly per unit distribution prorated for the 49-day period the Preferred Units were outstanding during the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  The changes in the redeemable preferred balance for   2016   were as follows: 

The purchasers may convert their Preferred Units into common units, at any time after the third anniversary of the issuance date or prior to liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, in full or in part, subject to minimum conversion amounts and conditions. After the fourth anniversary of the issuance date, the Partnership may convert the Preferred Units into common units at any time, in whole or in part, subject to certain minimum conversion amounts and conditions, if the closing price of MPLX LP common units is greater than $48.75 for the 20 day trading period immediately preceding the conversion notice date. The conversion rate for the Preferred Units shall be the quotient of (a) the sum of (i) $32.50, plus (ii) any unpaid cash distributions on the applicable Preferred Unit, divided by (b) $32.50. The holders of the Preferred Units are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with the common unitholders and will have certain other class voting rights with respect to any amendment to the partnership agreement that would adversely affect any rights, preferences or privileges of the Preferred Units. In addition, upon certain events involving a change in control the holders of Preferred Units may elect, among other potential elections, to convert their Preferred Units to common units at the then change of control conversion rate.    
    
  The Preferred Units are considered redeemable securities under GAAP due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is outside the Partnership s control. Therefore they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Preferred Units have been recorded at their issuance date fair value, net of issuance costs. Income allocations increase the carrying value, and declared distributions decreased the carrying value of the Preferred Units. Because the Preferred Units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable, adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable that the Preferred Units would become redeemable. 

9  . Segment Information 
    
  The Partnership s chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer ( CEO ) of its general partner. The CEO reviews the Partnership s discrete financial information, makes operating decisions, assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a type of service basis. The Partnership has   two   reportable segments: L S and G P. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. 

L S - transports and stores crude oil and refined petroleum products. Segment information for prior periods includes HSM as it is an entity under common control. 
                
    G P - gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs. This segment is the result of the MarkWest Merger on   December 4, 2015   discussed in more detail in Note   3  . Segment information for periods prior to the MarkWest Merger does not include amounts for these operations.  
       
  The Partnership has investments in entities that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting (see Note   4  ). However, the CEO views the Partnership operated equity method investments  financial information as if those investments were consolidated. 
    
  Segment operating income represents income from operations attributable to the reportable segments. Corporate general and administrative expenses, unrealized derivative gains (losses), property, plant and equipment impairment, goodwill impairment  
  
   28 

Table of Contents  

and depreciation and amortization are not allocated to the reportable segments. Management does not consider these items allocable to or controllable by any individual segment and, therefore, excludes these items when evaluating segment performance. Segment results are also adjusted to exclude the portion of income from operations attributable to the noncontrolling interests related to partially owned entities that are either consolidated or accounted for as equity method investments. 
    
  The tables below present information about income from operations and capital expenditures for the reported segments:

10  . Income Tax 
    
  The Partnership is not a taxable entity for United States federal income tax purposes or for the majority of states that impose an income tax. Taxes on the Partnership s net income generally are borne by its partners through the allocation of taxable income. The Partnership s income tax (benefit) provision results from partnership activity in the states of Texas, Ohio and Tennessee. 
    
  As a result of the Class A Reorganization discussed in Note   7  , MarkWest Hydrocarbon (MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. prior to the Class A Reorganization) is no longer a tax paying entity for federal income tax purposes or for the majority of states that impose an income tax effective September 1, 2016. After MarkWest Hydrocarbon files its 2016 income tax returns in 2017, the Partnership anticipates a residual tax provision to be recorded. In connection with the Class A Reorganization, MPC assumed   $377 million   of MPLX s deferred tax liabilities.

The following table provides additional information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of Level 3 instruments as of   September 30, 2016  . The market approach is used for valuation of all instruments. 

(1) 
    NGL prices used in the valuation are generally at the lower end of the range in the early years and increase over time. 
              (2) 
    Natural gas prices used in the valuations are generally at the lower end of the range in the early years and increase over time. 
              (3) 
    The producer counterparty to the embedded derivative has the option to renew the gas purchase agreement and the related keep-whole processing agreement for   two   successive   five  -year terms after 2022. The embedded gas purchase agreement cannot be renewed without the renewal of the related keep-whole processing agreement. Due to the significant number of

years until the renewal options are exercisable and the high level of uncertainty regarding the counterparty s future business strategy, the future commodity price environment, and the future competitive environment for midstream services in the Southern Appalachian region, management determined that a   50 percent   probability of renewal for the first five-year term and   75 percent   for the second five-year term are appropriate assumptions. Included in this assumption is a further extension of management s estimates of future frac spreads through 2032. 
    
  Fair Value Sensitivity Related to Unobservable Inputs 
    
  Commodity contracts (assets and liabilities)     For the Partnership s commodity contracts, increases in forward NGL prices result in a decrease in the fair value of the derivative assets and an increase in the fair value of the derivative liabilities. The forward prices for the individual NGL products generally increase or decrease in a positive correlation with one another. 
    
  Embedded derivatives in commodity contracts     The Partnership has   two   embedded derivatives in commodity contracts, as follows: 
             
    A single embedded derivative liability comprised of both the purchase of natural gas at prices impacted by the frac spread and the probability of contract renewal (the  Natural Gas Embedded Derivative ), as discussed further in Note   14  . Increases (decreases) in the frac spread result in an increase (decrease) in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability. An increase in the probability of renewal would result in an increase in the fair value of the related embedded derivative liability. 
                
    An embedded derivative related to utilities costs discussed further in Note   14  . Increases in the forward ERCOT prices result in a decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability. 
       
  Level 3 Valuation Process 
    
  The Partnership s Risk Management Department (the  Risk Department ) is responsible for the valuation of the Partnership s commodity derivative contracts and embedded derivatives in commodity contracts, except for the Natural Gas Embedded Derivative. The Risk Department reports to the Chief Financial Officer and is responsible for the oversight of the Partnership s commodity risk management program. The members of the Risk Department have the requisite experience, knowledge and day-to-day involvement in the energy commodity markets to ensure appropriate valuations and understand the changes in the valuations from period to period. The valuations of the Level 3 commodity derivative contracts are performed by a third-party pricing service and reviewed and validated on a quarterly basis by the Risk Department by comparing the pricing and option volatilities to actual market data and/or data provided by at least one other independent third-party pricing service. 
    
  Management is responsible for the valuation of the Natural Gas Embedded Derivative discussed in Note   14  . Included in the valuation of the Natural Gas Embedded Derivative are assumptions about the forward price curves for NGLs and natural gas for periods in which price curves are not available from third-party pricing services due to insufficient market data. The Risk Department must develop forward price curves for NGLs and natural gas through the initial contract term (September 2016 through December 2022) for management s use in determining the fair value of the Natural Gas Embedded Derivative. In developing the pricing curves for these periods, the Risk Department maximizes its use of the latest known market data and trends as well as its understanding of the historical relationships between forward NGL and natural gas prices and the forward market data that is available for the required period, such as crude oil pricing and natural gas pricing from other markets. However, there is very limited actual market data available to validate the Risk Department s estimated price curves. Management also assesses the probability of the producer customer s renewal of the contracts, which includes consideration of: 
             
    The estimated favorability of the contracts to the producer customer as compared to other options that would be available to them at the time and in the relative geographic area of their producing assets; 
                
    Extrapolated pricing curves, using a weighted average probability method that is based on historical frac spreads, which impact the calculation of favorability; 
                
    The producer customer s potential business strategy decision points that may exist at the time the counterparty would elect whether to renew the contracts.

    Certain derivative positions are subject to master netting agreements; therefore, the Partnership has elected to offset derivative assets and liabilities where legally permissible. The Partnership may hold positions with certain counterparties, which for GAAP purposes are classified within different levels of the fair value hierarchy and may be legally permissible to offset. This adjustment represents the total impact of offsetting Level 2 positions with Level 3 positions as of   September 30, 2016  .  
       
  Fair Values   Reported 
    
  The Partnership s primary financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents, receivables, receivables from related parties, accounts payable, payables to related parties and long-term debt. The Partnership s fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments, (2) MPC s investment-grade credit rating and (3) the historical incurrence of and expected future insignificance of bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The Partnership believes the carrying values of its current assets and liabilities approximate fair value. The recorded value of the amounts outstanding under the bank revolving credit facility, if any, approximates fair value due to the variable interest rate that approximates current market rates. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value, based on available market information (see Note   14  ). 
    
  The SMR liability and   $4.1 billion   aggregate principal of the Partnership s long-term debt were recorded at fair value in connection with the MarkWest Merger as of December 4, 2015, which established a new cost basis for each of those liabilities. The fair value of the long-term debt is estimated based on recent market non-binding indicative quotes. The fair value of the SMR liability is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach based on the contractual cash flows and the Partnership s unsecured borrowing rate. The long-term debt and SMR liability fair values are considered Level 3 measurements. 
    
  The following table summarizes the fair value and carrying value of the Partnership s long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and SMR liability.

14  . Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  Commodity Derivatives 
    
  NGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the Partnership s control. The Partnership s profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at its own or third-party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index-related prices and the cost of third-party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by the Partnership s producer customers, such prices also affect profitability. To protect itself financially against adverse price movements and to maintain more stable and predictable cash flows so that the Partnership can meet its cash distribution objectives, debt service and capital plans, the Partnership executes a strategy governed by its risk management policy. The Partnership has a committee comprised of senior management that oversees risk management activities, continually monitors the risk management program and adjusts its strategy as conditions warrant. The Partnership enters into certain derivative contracts to reduce the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the prices of natural gas and NGLs. Derivative contracts utilized are swaps and options traded on the OTC market and fixed price forward contracts. The risk management policy does not allow the Partnership to take speculative positions with its derivative contracts. 
    
  To mitigate its cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of NGLs, the Partnership has entered into derivative financial instruments relating to the future price of NGLs and crude oil. The Partnership currently manages the majority of its NGL price risk using direct product NGL derivative contracts. The Partnership enters into NGL derivative contracts when adequate market liquidity exists and future prices are satisfactory. A portion of the Partnership s NGL price exposure is managed by using crude oil contracts. In periods where NGL prices and crude oil prices are not consistent with the historical relationship, the crude oil contracts create increased risk and additional gains or losses. The Partnership may settle its crude oil contracts prior to the contractual settlement date in order to take advantage of favorable terms and reduce the future exposure resulting from the less effective crude oil contracts. Based on its current volume forecasts, the majority of its derivative positions used to manage the future commodity price exposure are expected to be direct product NGL derivative contracts. 
    
  To mitigate its cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas, the Partnership primarily utilizes derivative financial instruments relating to the future price of natural gas and takes into account the partial offset of its long and short gas positions resulting from normal operating activities. 
    
  As a result of its current derivative positions, the Partnership has mitigated a portion of its expected commodity price risk through the fourth quarter of 2017. The Partnership would be exposed to additional commodity risk in certain situations such as if producers under-deliver or over-deliver product or when processing facilities are operated in different recovery modes. In the event the Partnership has derivative positions in excess of the product delivered or expected to be delivered, the excess derivative positions may be terminated. 
    
  Management conducts a standard credit review on counterparties to derivative contracts, and has provided the counterparties with a guaranty as credit support for its obligations. A separate agreement with certain counterparties allows MarkWest Liberty Midstream   Resources L.L.C. ( MarkWest Liberty Midstream ) to enter into derivative positions without posting cash collateral. The Partnership uses standardized agreements that allow for offset of certain positive and negative exposures ( master netting arrangements ) in the event of default or other terminating events, including bankruptcy. 
    
  The Partnership records derivative contracts at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and has not elected hedge accounting or the normal purchases and normal sales designation (except for electricity and certain other qualifying contracts, for which the normal purchases and normal sales designation has been elected). The Partnership s accounting may cause volatility in the Consolidated Statements of Income as the Partnership recognizes in current earnings all unrealized gains and losses from the changes in fair value of derivatives.

Volume of Commodity Derivative Activity 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership had the following outstanding commodity contracts that were executed to manage the cash flow risk associated with future sales of NGLs: 

Embedded Derivatives in Commodity Contracts 
    
  The Partnership has a commodity contract with a producer customer in the Southern Appalachian region that creates a floor on the frac spread for gas purchases of   9,000   Dth/d. The commodity contract is a component of a broader regional arrangement that also includes a keep-whole processing agreement. For accounting purposes, these contracts have been aggregated into a single contract and are evaluated together. In February 2011, the Partnership executed agreements with the producer customer to extend the commodity contract and the related processing agreement from March 31, 2015 to December 31, 2022, with the producer customer s option to extend the agreement for   two   successive   five  -year terms through December 31, 2032. The purchase of gas at prices based on the frac spread and the option to extend the agreements have been identified as a single embedded derivative, which is recorded at fair value. The probability of renewal is determined based on extrapolated pricing curves, a review of the overall expected favorability of the contracts based on such pricing curves, and assumptions about the counterparty s potential business strategy decision points that may exist at the time the counterparty would elect whether to renew the contract. The changes in fair value of this embedded derivative are based on the difference between the contractual and index pricing, the probability of the producer customer exercising its option to extend and the estimated favorability of these contracts compared to current market conditions. The changes in fair value are recorded in earnings through   Purchased product costs   in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of this contract was   a liability   of   $44 million  . 
    
  The Partnership has a commodity contract that gives it an option to fix a component of the utilities cost to an index price on electricity at a plant location in the Southwest operations through the fourth quarter of 2017. The contract is currently fixed through the fourth quarter of 2016 with the ability to fix the commodity contract for its remaining year. Changes in the fair value of the derivative component of this contract were recognized as   Cost of revenues   in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of this contract was a liability less than   $1 million  . 
    
  Financial Statement Impact of Derivative Contracts 
    
  There were no material changes to the Partnership s policy regarding the accounting for these instruments as previously disclosed in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by the Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on May 20, 2016. The impact of the Partnership s derivative instruments on its Consolidated Balance Sheets is summarized below:

In the table above, the Partnership does not offset a counterparty s current derivative contracts with the counterparty s non-current derivative contracts, although the Partnership s master netting arrangements would allow current and non-current positions to be offset in the event of default. Additionally, in the event of a default, the Partnership s master netting arrangements would allow for the offsetting of all transactions executed under the master netting arrangement. These types of transactions may include non-derivative instruments, derivatives qualifying for scope exceptions, receivables and payables arising from settled positions and other forms of non-cash collateral (such as letters of credit).

The impact of the Partnership s derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments and the location of gain or (loss) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income is summarized below: 

15  . Debt 
    
  The Partnership s outstanding borrowings consisted of the following: 

Credit Agreements 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership borrowed   $434 million   under the bank revolving credit facility, at an average interest rate of   1.899 percent  , per annum, and repaid   $1.3 billion   under the bank revolving credit facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership had   no   outstanding borrowings and   $3 million   letters of credit outstanding under this facility, resulting in total availability of   $2 billion  , or   99.9 percent   of the borrowing capacity. 
    
  The   $250 million   term loan facility was drawn in full on November 20, 2014. The borrowings under this facility during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were at an average interest rate of   1.936 percent  . 

39 

16  . Goodwill  
    
  The Partnership annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as of November 30, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying amount. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership determined that an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was necessary based on consideration of a number of first quarter events and circumstances, including i) continued deterioration of near term commodity prices as well as longer term pricing trends, ii) recent guidance on reductions to forecasted capital spending, the slowing of drilling activity and the resulting reduced production growth forecasts released or communicated by the Partnership s producer customers and iii) increases in cost of capital. The combination of these factors was considered to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test. Based on the first step of the interim goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value for the   three   reporting units to which goodwill was assigned in connection with the MarkWest Merger was less than the respective carrying value. In step two of the impairment analysis, the implied fair values of the goodwill were compared to the carrying values within those reporting units. Based on this assessment, it was determined that goodwill was impaired in   two   of the   three   reporting units. Accordingly, the Partnership recorded an impairment charge of approximately   $129 million   in the first quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership completed its purchase price allocation, which resulted in an additional   $1 million   of impairment expense that would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2016 had the purchase price allocation been completed as of that date. This adjustment to the impairment expense was the result of completing an evaluation of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the MarkWest Merger and their impact on the resulting goodwill that was recognized. 
    
  The fair value of the reporting units for the interim goodwill impairment analysis was determined based on applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management s best estimates of the expected future results and discount rates, which range from   10.5 percent   to   11.5 percent  . The fair value of the intangibles was determined based on applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which is an income approach. Key assumptions included attrition rates by reporting unit ranging from   5.0 percent   to   10.0 percent   and discount rates by reporting unit ranging from   11.5 percent   to   12.8 percent  . Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The fair value measurements for the individual reporting units  overall fair values, and the fair values of the goodwill assigned thereto, represent Level 3 measurements. 
    
  The changes in carrying amount of goodwill for 2016 were as follows:

19  . Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Partnership is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Some of these matters are discussed below. For matters for which the Partnership has not recorded an accrued liability, the Partnership is unable to estimate a range of possible losses for the reasons discussed in more detail below. However, the ultimate resolution of some of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. 
    
  Environmental Matters     The Partnership is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for non-compliance. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , accrued liabilities for remediation totaled   $7 million   and   $1 million  , respectively. However, it is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be incurred or the penalties, if any, which may be imposed. At   September 30, 2016  , there was less than   $1 million   in receivables from MPC for indemnification of environmental costs related to incidents occurring prior to the Initial Offering. There were   $1 million   in receivables from MPC for indemnification at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  In July 2015, representatives from the EPA and the United States Department of Justice conducted a raid on a MarkWest Liberty Midstream pipeline launcher/receiver site utilized for pipeline maintenance operations in Washington County, Pennsylvania pursuant to a search warrant issued by a magistrate of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. As part of this initiative, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, with the assistance of EPA s Criminal Investigation Division proceeded with an investigation of MarkWest s launcher/receiver, pipeline and compressor station operations. In response to the investigation, MarkWest initiated independent studies which demonstrated that there was no risk to worker safety and no threat of public harm associated with MarkWest s launcher/receiver operations. These findings were supported by a subsequent inspection and review by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. After providing these studies, and other substantial documentation related to MarkWest's pipeline and compressor stations, and arranging site visits and conducting several meetings with the government s representatives, on September 13, 2016, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania rendered a declination decision, dropping its criminal investigation and declining to pursue charges in this matter. 
    
  MarkWest Liberty Midstream continues to discuss with the EPA and the State of Pennsylvania alleged omissions associated with permits or related regulatory obligations for its launcher/receiver and compressor station facilities in the region. It is possible that in connection with any potential or asserted enforcement action associated with this matter, MarkWest Liberty Midstream will incur material assessments, penalties or fines, incur material defense costs and expenses, be required to modify operations or construction activities which could increase operating costs and capital expenditures, or be subject to other obligations or restrictions that could restrict or prohibit our activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The amount of any potential assessments, penalties, fines, restrictions, requirements, modifications, costs or expenses that may be incurred in connection with any potential enforcement action cannot be reasonably estimated or determined at this time. 
    
  The Partnership is involved in a number of other environmental enforcement matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on MPLX cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the resolution of these environmental matters will not, individually or collectively, have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
    
  Other Lawsuits     In 2003, the State of Illinois brought an action against the Premcor Refining Group, Inc. ( Premcor ) and Apex Refining Company ( Apex ) asserting claims for environmental cleanup related to the refinery owned by these entities in the Hartford/Wood River, Illinois area. In 2006, Premcor and Apex filed third-party complaints against numerous owners and operators of petroleum products facilities in the Hartford/Wood River, Illinois area, including MPL. These complaints, which have been amended since filing, assert claims of common law nuisance and contribution under the Illinois Contribution Act and other laws for environmental cleanup costs that may be imposed on Premcor and Apex by the State of Illinois. On   September 6, 2016  , the trial court approved a settlement between Apex and the State of Illinois whereby Apex agreed to settle all claims against it for a   $10 million   payment. Premcor has objected to this ruling and is seeking an appeal. There are several third-party defendants in the litigation and MPL has asserted cross-claims in contribution against the various third-party defendants. This litigation is currently pending in the Third Judicial Circuit Court, Madison County, Illinois. While the ultimate outcome of these litigated matters remains uncertain, neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to this matter can be determined at this time and the Partnership is unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or  
  
   42 

Table of Contents  

range of loss) for this litigation. Under the omnibus agreement, MPC will indemnify the Partnership for the full cost of any losses should MPL be deemed responsible for any damages in this lawsuit. 
    
  The Partnership is also a party to a number of other lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate outcome and impact to the Partnership cannot be predicted with certainty, the Partnership believes the resolution of these other lawsuits and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Guarantees     Over the years, the Partnership has sold various assets in the normal course of its business. Certain of the related agreements contain performance and general guarantees, including guarantees regarding inaccuracies in representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, and environmental and general indemnifications that require the Partnership to perform upon the occurrence of a triggering event or condition. These guarantees and indemnifications are part of the normal course of selling assets. The Partnership is typically not able to calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be made under such contractual provisions because of the variability inherent in the guarantees and indemnities. Most often, the nature of the guarantees and indemnities is such that there is no appropriate method for quantifying the exposure because the underlying triggering event has little or no past experience upon which a reasonable prediction of the outcome can be based. 
    
  Contractual Commitments and Contingencies     At   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership s contractual commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment totaled   $202 million  . In addition, from time to time and in the ordinary course of business, the Partnership and its affiliates provide guarantees of the Partnership s subsidiaries payment and performance obligations in the G P segment. These commitments at   September 30, 2016   were primarily related to plant expansion projects for the Marcellus and Southwest operations and the Cornerstone Pipeline project. Certain natural gas processing and gathering arrangements require the Partnership to construct new natural gas processing plants, natural gas gathering pipelines and NGL pipelines and contain certain fees and charges if specified construction milestones are not achieved for reasons other than force majeure. In certain cases, certain producers may have the right to cancel the processing arrangements if there are significant delays that are not due to force majeure. As of   September 30, 2016  , management does not believe there are any indications that the Partnership will not be able to meet the construction milestones, that force majeure does not apply, or that such fees and charges will otherwise be triggered.

  PARTNERSHIP OVERVIEW 
    
  We are a diversified, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by MPC to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets. We are engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs; and the gathering, transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products. 
    
  SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND OTHER HIGHLIGHTS 
    
  Significant financial and other highlights for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   are listed below. Refer to Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details. 

L S segment operating income attributable to MPLX LP increased approximately   $43 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to the inclusion of HSM results after our acquisition as of March 31, 2016 as well as a reduction in contract services and materials and supplies. 
                
    G P segment operating income attributable to MPLX LP increased approximately   $293 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to the MarkWest Merger. 
                
    During the third quarter 2016, we issued an aggregate of 5,700,000 commons units under our ATM Program, generating net proceeds of approximately   $184 million  . As a result of common units issued under the ATM Program, MPLX GP contributed $5 million in exchange for 116,326 general partner units to maintain its two percent general partner interest. 
       
  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
    
  Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF. The amount of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF generated is considered by the Board of Directors of our general partner in approving the Partnership s cash distribution. 
    
  We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) benefit for income taxes; (iii)amortization of deferred financing costs; (iv) non-cash equity-based compensation; (v) impairment expense; (vi) net interest and other financial costs; (vii) income/loss from equity investments; (viii) distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries; (ix) unrealized gain/loss on commodity hedges; and (x) acquisition costs. We also use DCF, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA plus (i) the current period cash received/deferred revenue for committed volume deficiencies less (ii) net interest and other financial costs; (iii) gain on disposal of assets; (iv) equity investment maintenance capital expenditures; (v) current portion of income taxes; (vi) maintenance capital expenditures paid; (vii) volume deficiency credits recognized; and (viii) other non-cash items. 
    
  We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered as alternatives  
  
   44 

Table of Contents  

to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to their most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see Results of Operations. 
    
  Management evaluates contract performance on the basis of net operating margin (a non-GAAP financial measure), which is defined as segment revenue less segment purchased product costs less realized derivative gain (loss). These charges have been excluded for the purpose of enhancing the understanding by both management and investors of the underlying baseline operating performance of our contractual arrangements, which management uses to evaluate our financial performance for purposes of planning and forecasting. Net operating margin does not have any standardized definition and, therefore, is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other reporting companies. Net operating margin results should not be evaluated in isolation of, or as a substitute for, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our use of net operating margin and the underlying methodology in excluding certain charges is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations expected in the future, or that we will not, in fact, incur such charges in future periods. 
    
  In evaluating our financial performance, management utilizes the segment performance measures, segment revenues and segment operating income, including total segment operating income. These financial measures are presented in Item 1. Financial Statements - Note   9   and are considered non-GAAP financial measures when presented outside of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of these measures allows investors to understand how management evaluates financial performance to make operating decisions and allocate resources. See Note   9   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliations of these segment measures, including total segment operating income, to their respective most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  Total revenues and other income   increased     $489 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was primarily related to a $487 million increase due to the MarkWest Merger, an increase due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped and an increase in storage fees partially offset by a reduction in fees previously paid by HSM on behalf of MPC that are now being paid directly by MPC. 
    
  Cost of revenues   increased     $31 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger, offset by a reduction in contract services and fees previously paid by HSM on behalf of MPC that are now paid directly by MPC. 
    
  Purchased product costs   increased     $117 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger. 
    
  Rental cost of sales   increased     $11 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.

Purchases-related parties   increased     $41 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increase was primarily due to higher compensation expenses provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC due to the MarkWest Merger, partially offset by increased capitalization of employee costs associated with capital projects. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense   increased     $119 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger. 
    
  General and administrative expenses   increased     $21 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increases were primarily due to the MarkWest Merger offset by a reduction in expenses due to changes in allocations provided for in the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC. 
    
  Interest expense and other financial costs   increased     $59 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increases are primarily due to the senior notes assumed as part of the MarkWest Merger. 
    
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  Total revenues and other income   increased     $1.2 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was primarily related to a $1.2 billion increase due to the MarkWest Merger and an increase due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped. The   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   also includes an impairment expense of   $89 million   related to Ohio Condensate. See Note   4   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
    
  Cost of revenues   increased     $116 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger, offset by a reduction in contract services and fees previously paid by HSM on behalf of MPC that are now paid directly by MPC. 
    
  Purchased product costs   increased     $310 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger. 
    
  Rental cost of sales   increased     $39 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger. 
    
  Purchases-related parties   increased     $115 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increases were primarily due to higher compensation expenses provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC due to the MarkWest Merger, partially offset by increased capitalization of employee costs associated with capital projects. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense   increased     $349 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger. 
    
  Impairment expense   increased     $130 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This variance was due to a non-cash impairment to goodwill in two reporting units in the G P segment. See Note   16   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
    
  General and administrative expenses   increased     $79 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increases were primarily due to the MarkWest Merger offset by a reduction in expenses due to changes in allocations provided for in the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC. 
    
  Interest expense and other financial costs   increased     $179 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . The increases are primarily due to the senior notes assumed as part of the MarkWest Merger. 

SEGMENT RESULTS 
    
  We classify our business in the following reportable segments:   L S   and   G P  . Segment operating income represents income from operations attributable to the reportable segments. We have investments in entities that we operate that are accounted for using equity method investment accounting standards. However, we view financial information as if those investments were consolidated. Corporate general and administrative expenses, unrealized derivative gains (losses), property, plant and equipment impairment, goodwill impairment and depreciation and amortization are not allocated to the reportable segments. Management does not consider these items allocable to or controllable by any individual segment and, therefore, excludes these  
  
   49 

Table of Contents  

items when evaluating segment performance. Segment results are also adjusted to exclude the portion of income from operations attributable to the noncontrolling interests related to partially owned entities that are either consolidated or accounted for as equity method investments. 
    
  The tables below present information about segment operating income for the reported segments.  
    
  L S Segment    

Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , segment revenue increased due to a $4 million increase in higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped in addition to a $1 million increase related to a 40 mbpd increase in product and crude oil volumes shipped. 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , segment other income decreased due to a reduction in fees paid to HSM by MPC partially offset by increased storage fees. 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , segment cost of revenues decreased primarily due to $5 million in fees previously paid by HSM on behalf of MPC that are now being paid directly by MPC and a $4 million decrease in expenses related to the timing of projects. 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , the segment portion attributable to noncontrolling interest and Predecessor decreased due to the acquisition of HSM as of March 31, 2016. 
    
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , segment revenue increased due to a $16 million increase in higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped and a $3 million increase in storage service income, offset by a $1 million decrease related to a 4 mbpd decline in product and crude oil volumes shipped and a $7 million decrease in revenue related to volume deficiency credits recognized. 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , segment other income decreased due to a reduction in fees paid to HSM by MPC partially offset by increased storage fees. 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , segment cost of revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in fees previously paid by HSM on behalf of MPC that are now being paid directly by MPC and a decrease in expenses related to the timing of projects. 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , the segment portion attributable to noncontrolling interest and Predecessor decreased due to the acquisition of HSM as of March 31, 2016.

During both the   third   quarter and the first   nine   months of   2016  , MPC did not ship its minimum committed volumes on certain of our pipeline systems. As a result, for the first   nine   months, MPC was obligated to make a   $32 million   deficiency payment, of which   $10 million   was paid in the   third   quarter of   2016  . We record deficiency payments as   Deferred revenue-related parties   on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the   third   quarter and the first   nine   months of   2016  , we recognized revenue of   $11 million   and   $26 million  , respectively, related to volume deficiency credits. At   September 30, 2016  , the cumulative balance of   Deferred revenue-related parties   on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to volume deficiencies was   $42 million  . The following table presents the future expiration dates of the associated deferred revenue credits as of   September 30, 2016  : 

We will recognize revenue for the deficiency payments in future periods at the earlier of when volumes are transported in excess of the minimum quarterly volume commitments, when it becomes impossible to physically transport volumes necessary to utilize the accumulated credits or upon expiration of the make-up period. Deficiency payments are included in the determination of DCF in the period in which a deficiency occurs. 
    
  G P Segment 
    
  Our assets include approximately   5,500   MMcf/d of gathering capacity,   7,500   MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and   500   mbpd of fractionation capacity. We also own more than   5,500   miles of gas gathering and NGL pipelines and have ownership interests in   54   gas processing plants,   13   NGL fractionation facilities and   two   condensate stabilization facilities. 

The G P segment increased overall due to the MarkWest Merger. There was no G P segment prior to the MarkWest Merger. See Supplemental MD A - G P Pro Forma for more information.

The following tables provide reconciliations of segment operating income to our consolidated income from operations, segment revenue to our consolidated total revenues and other income, and segment portion attributable to noncontrolling interest to our consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Adjustments related to unconsolidated affiliates relate to our Partnership operated non-wholly-owned entities that we consolidate for segment purposes. 

Income (loss) from equity method investments   relates to our portion of income from our unconsolidated joint ventures of which Partnership operated joint ventures are consolidated for segment purposes. The   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes an impairment expense of   $89 million   related to Ohio Condensate. See Note   4   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Other income-related parties   consists of operational service fee revenues from our operated unconsolidated affiliates. 
    
  The change in fair value of our   Product sales   derivative instruments resulted in an unrealized gain of   $2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and an unrealized loss of   $12 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Unrealized loss from the change in fair value of our   Purchased product costs   derivative instruments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $3 million   and   $12 million  , respectively. The change in fair value of our   Cost of revenues   derivative instruments resulted in an unrealized loss of   $1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and an unrealized gain of   $1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Unrealized derivative activity is not allocated to segments. 

OUR G P CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES 
    
  We generate the majority of our revenues in the G P segment from natural gas gathering, transportation and processing; NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, exchange, marketing and storage; and crude oil gathering and transportation. We enter into a variety of contract types. In many cases, we provide services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described below. We provide services under the following types of arrangements: fee-based, percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-index and keep-whole. See Item 1. Business-Our G P Contracts With Third Parties in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as updated by our Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on May 20, 2016, for further discussion of each of these types of arrangements. 
    
  The following table does not give effect to our active commodity risk management program. We manage our business by taking into account the partial offset of short natural gas positions primarily in the Southwest region of our G P segment. The calculated percentages for net operating margin for percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-index and keep-whole contracts reflect the partial offset of our natural gas positions. The calculated percentages are less than one percent for percent-of-index due to the offset of our natural gas positions and, therefore, not meaningful to the table below. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we calculated the following approximate percentages of our net operating margin from the following types of contracts: 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we calculated the following approximate percentages of our net operating margin from the following types of contracts:

    Includes condensate sales and other types of arrangements tied to NGL prices. 
              (2) 
    Includes condensate sales and other types of arrangements tied to both NGL and natural gas prices.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net operating margin to income from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

    These amounts relate to Partnership operated unconsolidated affiliates. The chief operating decision maker and management include these to evaluate the segment performance as we continue to operate and manage the operations. Therefore, the impact of the revenue is included for segment reporting purposes, but removed for GAAP purposes. 
       
  SEASONALITY 
    
  Many effects of seasonality on the L S segment s revenues will be mitigated through the use of our fee-based transportation and storage services agreements with MPC that include minimum volume commitments. Historically, the L S segment has spent approximately two-thirds of both our budgeted maintenance capital expenditures and budgeted pipeline integrity, repair and maintenance expenses during the third and fourth quarter of each calendar year due to our budgeting cycle, operating conditions, weather and safety concerns. 
    
  Our G P segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and NGLs and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year. However, we manage the seasonality impact through the execution of our marketing strategy. We have access to up to   50 million   gallons of propane storage capacity in the Southern Appalachia region provided by an arrangement with a third-party which provides us with flexibility to manage the seasonality impact. Overall, our exposure to the seasonal fluctuations in the commodity markets is declining due to our growth in fee-based business.

SUPPLEMENTAL MD A - G P PRO FORMA 
    
  Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  The tables below present financial information, as evaluated by management, for the reported segments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The 2016 amounts are actual results. This is a supplemental disclosure showing G P segment results as if it were acquired as of January 1, 2014 and it incorporates pro forma adjustments necessary, to reflect a January 1, 2014 acquisition date (see reconciliations below). The pro forma information was prepared in a manner consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and FASB ASC Topic 805 (see Note   3   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We believe this data will provide a more meaningful discussion of trends for the G P segment as it helps convey the impact of commodity pricing and volume changes to the business. Future results may vary significantly from the results reflected below because of various factors. In addition, all Partnership operated, non-wholly-owned subsidiaries are treated as if they are consolidated for segment reporting purposes (for more information on how management has determined our segments, see Note   9   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , segment revenue increased slightly due to an increase in volumes as well as increased natural gas and NGL prices. Total gathering throughput, total natural gas processed and total C2+ NGLs fractionated volumes increased by   8 percent  ,   15 percent   and   27 percent  , respectively. These volume increases mainly related to our expansions in Marcellus and Utica operations. Additionally, there was a   three percent   increase in natural gas prices and a   10 percent   increase in NGL prices over the same period in 2015. 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , segment cost of revenues increased mainly due to increases in natural gas purchased prices and NGL prices. Segment cost of revenues as a percentage of segment revenues and other income increased   one percent   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . This was primarily due to the increase in percent-of-proceeds revenue as a percentage of total revenue by one percent as a result of higher pricing. 
    
  The change in the segment portion of operating income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to ongoing growth in our entities that are not wholly-owned.

Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , segment revenue increased slightly due to an increase in volumes. Total gathering throughput, total natural gas processed and total C2+ NGLs fractionated volumes increased by   15 percent  ,   13 percent   and   27 percent  , respectively. These volume increases mainly related to our expansions in Marcellus and Utica operations. This increase was offset by a   15 percent   decrease in natural gas prices and a   6 percent   decrease in NGL prices over the same period in 2015. 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , segment cost of revenues remained stable. Product purchases decreased 14 percent primarily due to lower prices offset by increases to operating expenses related to expansions of plant and gathering system assets. Segment cost of revenues as a percentage of segment revenues and other income decreased   three percent   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . 
    
  The increase in the segment portion of operating income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015   is due to ongoing growth in our entities that are not wholly-owned.

  The following tables provide reconciliations of G P segment revenues and other income to total revenues and other income and G P s segment operating income attributable to MPLX LP to net income attributable to MPLX LP, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The ensuing items listed below the   Other income-related parties   lines are not allocated to business segments as management does not consider these items allocable to any individual segment.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Our cash and cash equivalents balance was   $208 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $43 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The change in cash and cash equivalents was due to the factors discussed below. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities were as follows: 

Net cash provided by operating activities   increased     $674 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  , the majority of which is related to the MarkWest Merger. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities increased   $658 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  , primarily due to a   $745 million   use of cash for additions to property, plant and equipment related to various capital projects, mainly due to the acquisition of MarkWest, and a   $56 million   use of cash for investments in unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by a   $141 million   source of cash from investment loans between HSM and related parties. 
    
  Financing activities were a   $82 million   source of cash in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to a   $4 million   use of cash in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The source of cash in the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily due to   $510 million   of net proceeds from sales of common units under the ATM Program,   $984 million   of net proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Units and contributions of   $225 million   from MPC as part of the Class A Reorganization, partially offset by   $878 million   in net repayments on the bank revolving credit facility,   $8 million   of net repayments from the related party debt borrowings, distributions of   $612 million   and   $104 million   in distributions to MPC from Predecessor. The use of cash in the first   nine   months of   2015   was primarily due to   $416 million   in repayments on the bank revolving credit facility and distributions of   $111 million  , partially offset by $495 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes due 2025 and borrowings of $30 million under the bank revolving credit facility.

Debt and Liquidity Overview 
    
  Our outstanding borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following: 

The decrease in debt as of   September 30, 2016   compared to year-end   2015   was primarily related to the repayment of the bank revolving credit facility using proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Units. 
    
  Our bank revolving credit facility and term loan facility ( MPLX Credit Agreement ) include certain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of that type, and that could, among other things, limit our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders. The financial covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with this financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.5 to 1.0, as well as other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement. 
    
  Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of   September 30, 2016  , the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. 
    
                   Rating Agency 
      
    Rating 
      Fitch 
      
    BBB- (stable outlook) 
      Moody s 
      
    Baa3 (stable outlook) 
      Standard   Poor s 
      
    BBB- (stable outlook) 

The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. 
    
  The MPLX Credit Agreement does not contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades in the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt ratings to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates and other fees payable under the MPLX Credit Agreement and may limit our flexibility to obtain future financing.

Our liquidity totaled   $2.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   consisting of: 

(1) 
    Outstanding borrowings include   $3 million   in letters of credit outstanding under this facility. 
       
  We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit agreements and issuances of additional debt and equity securities. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term funding requirements, including working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, repayment of debt maturities and quarterly cash distributions. MPC manages our cash and cash equivalents on our behalf directly with third-party institutions as part of the treasury services that it provides to us under our omnibus agreement. 
    
  Equity and Preferred Unit Overview 
    
  The table below summarizes the changes in the number of units outstanding through   September 30, 2016  : 

For more details on equity activity, see Notes   7   and   8   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  On May 13, 2016, the Partnership completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million Preferred Units for a cash purchase price of $32.50 per unit. The aggregate net proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the Preferred Units will be used for capital expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes. With the completion of its $1.3 billion of financing earlier this year, the Partnership has provided for its forecast funding needs through the remainder of 2016 and into 2017. 
    
  On   July 1, 2016  , 3,990,878 Class B units automatically converted into 1.09 MPLX LP common units and the right to receive $6.20 per unit in cash. They are also eligible to receive the second quarter distribution. MPC funded this cash payment, which reduced our liability payable to Class B unitholders by approximately $25 million on   July 1, 2016  . As a result of the Class B units conversion on July 1, 2016, MPLX GP contributed less than   $1 million   in exchange for 7,330 general partner units to maintain its   two percent   general partner interest. 
    
  On   August 4, 2016  , the Partnership entered into a second amended and restated distribution agreement providing for the continuous issuance of up to an aggregate of   $1.2 billion   of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings. The Partnership expects the net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program will be used for general partnership purposes including repayment or refinancing of debt and funding for acquisitions, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the sale of common units under the ATM Program generated net proceeds of approximately   $499 million  .

On September 1, 2016, the Partnership and various affiliates initiated a series of reorganization transactions in order to simplify the Partnership s ownership structure and its financial and tax reporting requirements. In connection with these transactions, all issued and outstanding MPLX LP Class A units were either distributed to or purchased by MPC in exchange for $84 million in cash, 21,401,137 MPLX LP common units and 436,758 MPLX LP general partner units. MPC also contributed $141 million to facilitate the repayment of intercompany debt between MarkWest Hydrocarbon and MarkWest. As a result of these transactions, the MPLX LP Class A units were eliminated, are no longer outstanding and no longer participate in distributions of cash from the Partnership. See additional discussion in Notes   7   and   10   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  We intend to pay at least the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2625 per unit per quarter, which equates to $93 million per quarter, or $373 million per year, based on the number of common and general partner units outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . On   October 25, 2016  , we announced the board of directors of our general partner had declared a distribution of   $0.5150   per unit that will be paid on   November 14, 2016   to unitholders of record on   November 4, 2016  . This represents an increase of   0.0050   per unit, or   one percent  , above the second quarter 2016 distribution of   $0.5100   per unit and an increase of   10 percent   over the   third   quarter   2015   distribution. This increase in the distribution is consistent with our intent to maintain an attractive distribution growth profile over an extended period of time. Although our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash each quarter, we do not otherwise have a legal obligation to distribute any particular amount per unit. 
    
  The allocation of total quarterly cash distributions to general and limited partners is as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Our distributions are declared subsequent to quarter end; therefore, the following table represents total cash distributions applicable to the period in which the distributions were earned. 

Our intentions regarding the distribution growth profile expressed above include forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied in the forward-looking statements include: the adequacy of our capital resources and liquidity, including, but not limited to, the availability of sufficient cash flow to pay distributions and execute our business plan; negative capital market conditions, including a persistence or increase of the current yield on common units, which is higher than historical yields; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, feedstocks or refined petroleum products; volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions; completion of midstream capacity by our competitors; disruptions due to equipment interruption or failure, including electrical shortages and power grid failures; the suspension, reduction or termination of MPC s obligations under our commercial agreements; our ability to successfully implement our growth plan, whether through organic growth or acquisitions; modifications to earnings and distribution objectives; state and federal environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations; changes to our capital budget; financial stability of our producer customers and MPC; other risk factors inherent to our industry; and the factors set forth under the heading  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as updated by our Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on May 20, 2016, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. In addition, the forward-looking statements included herein could be affected by general domestic and international economic and political conditions. Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed here or in our SEC filings could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

Capital Expenditures 
    
  Our operations are capital intensive, requiring investments to expand, upgrade, enhance or maintain existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements consist of maintenance capital expenditures and growth capital expenditures. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are those made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining existing system volumes and related cash flows. In contrast, growth capital expenditures are those incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating capacity to increase volumes gathered, processed, transported or fractionated, decrease operating expenses within our facilities or increase operating income over the long term. Examples of growth capital expenditures include the acquisition of equipment or the construction costs associated with new well connections, and the development or acquisition of additional pipeline, processing or storage capacity. In general, growth capital includes costs that are expected to generate additional or new cash flow for us. 
    
  Our capital expenditures are shown in the table below: 

(1) 
    Includes amounts related to unconsolidated, Partnership operated subsidiaries. 
              (2) 
    This represents estimated joint venture partners  share of growth capital. 
       
  Our gross organic growth capital plan for   2016   was narrowed to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. The expected 2016 capital spending and investments excludes our anticipated investment in the Bakken Pipeline system. The preliminary 2017 forecast for gross organic growth capital expenditures is $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion and maintenance capital is expected to be approximately $100 million. We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant. 
    
  Contractual Cash Obligations 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations for services and to acquire property, plant and equipment, and other liabilities. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our bank revolving credit facility committed payments decreased $955 million due to the repayment of the bank revolving credit facility and contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment increased $58 million largely due to the spending associated with various projects. There were no other material changes to these obligations outside the ordinary course of business since   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.

MPC Strategic Actions 
    
  On October 26, 2016, MPC announced it plans to offer the Partnership assets contributing approximately $350 million of annual EBITDA in 2017, with the first drop of approximately $235 million of annual EBITDA by the end of the first quarter. The Partnership's plans for funding these dropdowns would likely include transactions with MPC, including the potential for a substantial amount of equity to MPC. MPC intends to execute on additional value-enhancing dropdowns totaling an estimated $1.0 billion of annual EBITDA to the Partnership by December 31, 2019. The dropdown strategy is subject to market and other conditions, as well as requisite approvals. In addition to the expected dropdowns, MPC announced the evaluation of opportunities to optimize the Partnership's cost of capital through a strategic review of its general partner interest. 
    
  Forward-looking Statements 
    
  The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to certain strategic actions announced by MPC, including MPC s dropdown strategy and the Partnership s plans for funding such dropdowns. Factors that could affect strategic actions announced by MPC, including MPC s dropdown strategy and the Partnership s plans for funding such dropdowns, include, but are not limited to, the time, costs and ability to obtain regulatory or other approvals and consents and otherwise consummate such strategic actions; the satisfaction or waiver of conditions in the agreements governing such strategic actions; the ability to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to the strategic actions; the impact of adverse market conditions affecting the Partnership s businesses; adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters; the MPLX conflicts committee review process with respect to the timing of and value attributed to assets expected to be offered to the Partnership. Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options, mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and future credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined petroleum products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, material and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 
    
  TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , MPC held a two percent general partner interest and a 24.86 percent limited partner interest in MPLX LP.  
    
  Excluding revenues attributable to volumes shipped by MPC under joint tariffs with third parties that are treated as third-party revenues for accounting purposes, MPC accounted for   28 percent   and   91 percent   of our total revenues and other income for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. MPC accounted for   31 percent   and   91 percent   of our total revenues and other income for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. We provide crude oil and product pipeline transportation services based on regulated tariff rates and storage services and inland marine transportation based on contracted rates. 
    
  Of our total costs and expenses, MPC accounted for   23 percent   and   42 percent   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   20 percent   and   44 percent   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. MPC performed certain services for us related to information technology, engineering, legal, accounting, treasury, human resources and other administrative services. 
    
  We believe that transactions with related parties have been conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. For further discussion of agreements and activity with MPC and related parties see Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as updated by our Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on May 20, 2016, and Note   5   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS 
    
  We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the age and location of its operating facilities. 
    
  In February 2016, we identified a release of heat transfer oil at our Mobley gas processing facility in Wetzel County, West Virginia. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred approximately   $6 million   in remediation expenses and we estimate that there will be no material incremental charges. There were no expenses incurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This incident has been submitted to our insurance carriers. 
    
  On April 17, 2016, a release of diesel fuel was discovered near Crawleyville, Indiana from our pipeline that transports products from Robinson, Illinois to Mount Vernon, Indiana. The estimated volume of the release is 1,150 barrels. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred approximately $2 million in remediation expenses, and we do not anticipate that there will be any material incremental costs incurred in connection with this matter. We have submitted this incident to our insurers. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no significant changes (except the incident discussed above) to our environmental matters and compliance costs since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as updated by our Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on May 20, 2016.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as updated by our Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on May 20, 2016, except as noted below. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. In the   third   quarter of 2016, MPLX also considered whether there was any indication of impairment of equity method investments recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger and determined that there were none, other than the impairment recorded related to our investment in Ohio Condensate Company.

Management evaluates our long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment when certain events have taken place that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from the expected undiscounted future cash flows. Qualitative and quantitative information is reviewed in order to determine if a triggering event has occurred or if an impairment indicator exists. If we determine that a triggering event has occurred we would complete a full impairment analysis. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset grouping is not recoverable, a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value. We evaluate our property, plant and equipment and intangibles on at least a segment level and at lower levels where cash flows for specific assets can be identified, which generally is the plant level for our G P segment, the pipeline system level for our L S segment, and the customer relationship for our customer contract intangibles. 
    Management considers the volume of reserves dedicated to be processed by the asset and future NGL product and natural gas prices to estimate cash flows for each asset group. Management considers the expected net operating margin to be earned by customers for each customer contract intangible. Management uses discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each asset considered. The amount of additional reserves developed by future drilling activity and expected net operating margin earned by customer depends, in part, on expected commodity prices. Projections of reserves, drilling activity, ability to renew contracts of significant customers, and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors, many of which are difficult to forecast. Management considered the sustained reduction of commodity prices in forecasted cash flows. 
    As of December 31, 2015, there were no indicators of impairment for any of our long-lived assets. A significant variance in any of the assumptions or factors used to estimate future cash flows could result in the impairment of an asset.

    Judgments and Uncertainties 
    Effect if Actual Results Differ from Estimates and Assumptions 
      Impairment of Goodwill 

Goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of November 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The first step of the evaluation is a qualitative analysis to determine if it is  more likely than not  that the carrying value of a reporting unit with goodwill exceeds its fair value. The additional quantitative steps in the goodwill impairment test may be performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value is greater than the fair value. 
    Management performed a quantitative analysis during the first quarter of 2016, and determined the fair value of our reporting units in both the G P and L S segments using the income and market approaches for our first quarter 2016 impairment analysis. Management performed a qualitative analysis during the second quarter of 2016 and concluded that there were no indicators that would cause us to proceed to a quantitative analysis for the second quarter. These types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry and economic factors such as relevant commodity prices, contract renewals, and production volumes. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.   Management is also required to make certain assumptions when identifying the reporting units and determining the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit. The method of allocating goodwill resulting from the acquisitions involved estimating the fair value of the reporting units and allocating the purchase price for each acquisition to each reporting unit. Goodwill is then calculated for each reporting unit as the excess of the allocated purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets. 
    During the first quarter of 2016, we determined that an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was necessary based on consideration of a number of first quarter events and circumstances, including i) continued deterioration of near term commodity prices as well as longer term pricing trends, ii) recent guidance on reductions to forecasted capital spending, the slowing of drilling activity and the resulting reduced production growth forecasts released or communicated by our producer customers and iii) increases in cost of capital. The combination of these factors was considered to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test. Based on the first step of the interim goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value for the three reporting units to which goodwill was assigned in connection with the merger was less than the respective carrying value. In step two of the impairment analysis, the implied fair values of the goodwill were compared to the carrying values within those reporting units. Based on this assessment, it was determined that goodwill was impaired in two of the three reporting units. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $129 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
   The fair value of the reporting units for the interim goodwill impairment analysis was determined based on applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method include management s best estimates of the expected future results and discount rates, which range from 10.5 percent to 11.5 percent. The fair value of the intangibles was determined based on applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which is an income approach. Key assumptions include attrition rates by reporting unit ranging from 5.0 percent to 10.0 percent and discount rates by reporting unit ranging from 11.5 percent to 12.8 percent. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the first quarter interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. 
    
  We did not record an impairment charge in the Marcellus reporting unit within the G P segment, which is the only other reporting unit within the G P segment that has assigned goodwill. As of March 31, 2016, our allocation of the purchase price was provisional. Based on our assessment as of that date, the Marcellus reporting unit had $1,814 million of goodwill assigned to it (which amount was not adjusted as of June 30, 2016 when we finalized our purchase price allocation). Step 1 of the first quarter 2016 interim impairment analysis resulted in the carrying value of the Marcellus reporting unit exceeding its fair value by 0.62%; therefore, we completed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment analysis. Step 2 of the goodwill impairment analysis requires us to determine the fair value of all assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests, if any, of the reporting unit, whether or not currently recognized. The implied fair value of goodwill is the residual value of the reporting unit's fair value, less the fair value of the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests, if any. The results of our Step 2 first quarter 2016 interim impairment analysis concluded that the fair value of the goodwill of the Marcellus reporting unit exceeded its carrying value of $1,814 million by approximately $20 million, or 1.2%. An increase of 0.50% to the discount rate used to estimate Marcellus' fair value as of the first quarter 2016 interim impairment analysis would have resulted in an additional goodwill impairment charge of more than $400 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The other significant assumption used to estimate the Marcellus reporting unit's fair value included estimates of future cash flows. If estimates for future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by commodity prices and producers' production plans, for this reporting unit were to decline, the overall reporting unit's fair value would decrease, resulting in a potential goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, an increase in the cost of capital would result in a decrease in the fair value of the Marcellus reporting unit, causing its value to decline and goodwill to potentially be impaired. 
   During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was not necessary. The stabilization or improvement in the second quarter of the circumstances considered during our first quarter impairment analysis, the date of our last full goodwill impairment analysis, lead to our conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying values.   
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, we completed our purchase price accounting for the MarkWest Merger. The completion of this accounting resulted in additional goodwill attributed to the reporting units for which an impairment charge had been taken in the first quarter of 2016. We therefore recorded an additional $1 million of impairment expense in the second quarter of 2016.

    Effect if Actual Results Differ from Estimates and Assumptions 
      Impairment of Equity Method Investments 

We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management s judgment, that the carrying value of such investment may have experienced a decline in value. When evidence of an other-than-temporary loss in value has occurred, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment should be recorded. 
    Our impairment assessment requires us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows received from or attributable to our equity method investments. The primary estimates may include the expected volumes, the terms of related customer agreements and future commodity prices.  
    Our equity method investments were recorded at fair value in connection with the MarkWest Merger on December 4, 2015. If expected cash flows used to determine the fair value as of December 4, 2015 are not realized our equity method investments may be subject to future impairment charges. Based on a review of cash flow forecasts as of the second quarter of 2016, we have concluded that no indicators of an other than temporary impairment exist except for Ohio Condensate. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, forecasts for Ohio Condensate were reduced to align with updated forecasts for customer requirements. As the operator of that entity responsible for maintaining its financial records, we completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of June 30, 2016, in accordance with ASC Topic 360, to determine the potential fixed asset impairment charge. The resulting fixed asset impairment charge recorded within Ohio Condensate s financial statements was $96 million. Based on the Partnership s 60% ownership of Ohio Condensate, approximately $58 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in   Income (loss) from equity method investments   on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The Partnership s investment in Ohio Condensate, which was established at fair value in connection with the MarkWest Merger, exceeded its proportionate share of the underlying net assets. Therefore, in conjunction with the ASC Topic 360 analysis, we completed an equity method impairment analysis in accordance with ASC Topic 323 to determine the potential additional equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our consolidated financial statements resulting from an other-than-temporary impairment. As a result, an additional impairment charge of approximately $31 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in   Income (loss) from equity method investments   on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income, which eliminated the basis differential established in connection with the MarkWest Merger. 
    
  The fair value of Ohio Condensate and its underlying fixed assets was determined based upon applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management s best estimates of the expected future results using a probability weighted average set of cash flow forecasts and a discount rate of 11.2%. An increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points would have resulted in an additional charge of $1 million on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As such, the fair value of the Ohio Condensate equity method investment and its underlying fixed assets represents a Level 3 measurement. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.

The following tables provides information on the volume of MarkWest Liberty Midstream s commodity derivative activity positions related to long liquids price risk entered into subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , including the WAVG: 

We have a commodity contract with a producer customer in the Southern Appalachian region that creates a floor on the frac spread for gas purchases of 9,000 Dth/d. The commodity contract is a component of a broader regional arrangement that also includes a keep-whole processing agreement. For accounting purposes, these contracts have been aggregated into a single contract and are evaluated together. In February 2011, we executed agreements with the producer customer to extend the commodity contract and the related processing agreement from March 31, 2015 to December 31, 2022, with the producer customer s option to extend the agreement for two successive five-year terms through December 31, 2032. The purchase of gas at prices based on the frac spread and the option to extend the agreements have been identified as a single embedded derivative, which is recorded at fair value. The probability of renewal is determined based on extrapolated pricing curves, a review of the overall expected favorability of the contracts based on such pricing curves, and assumptions about the counterparty s potential business strategy decision points that may exist at the time the counterparty would elect whether to renew the contracts. The changes in fair value of this embedded derivative are based on the difference between the contractual and index pricing, the probability of the producer customer exercising its option to extend and the estimated favorability of these contracts compared to current market conditions. The changes in fair value are recorded in earnings through   Purchased product costs   in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of this contract was   a liability   of   $44 million  . 
    
  We have a commodity contract that gives us an option to fix a component of the utilities cost to an index price on electricity at a plant location in the Southwest operations through the fourth quarter of 2017. The contract is currently fixed through the fourth quarter of 2016 with the ability to fix the commodity contract for its remaining year. Changes in the fair value of the derivative component of this contract were recognized as   Cost of revenues   in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of this contract was   a liability   of less than   $1 million  . 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt, excluding capital leases, is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table. 

(1) 
    Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities. 
               (3) 
    Assumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change to net income was based on the weighted average balance of all outstanding variable-rate debt for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio of long-term debt consisted of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate instruments under our term loan facility. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under our term loan facility, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows. As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations; however, we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements in the future.

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our general partner. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our general partner concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this report.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported. 
    
  Litigation 
    
  We are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
    
  As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, in 2003, the State of Illinois brought an action against the Premcor Refining Group, Inc. ( Premcor ) and Apex Refining Company ( Apex ) asserting claims for environmental cleanup related to the refinery owned by these entities in the Hartford/Wood River, Illinois area. In 2006, Premcor and Apex filed third-party complaints against numerous owners and operators of petroleum products facilities in the Hartford/Wood River, Illinois area, including MPL. These complaints, which have been amended since filing, assert claims of common law nuisance and contribution under the Illinois Contribution Act and other laws for environmental cleanup costs that may be imposed on Premcor and Apex by the State of Illinois. On September 6, 2016, the trial court approved a settlement between Apex and the State of Illinois whereby Apex agreed to settle all claims against it for a $10 million payment. Premcor has objected to this ruling and is seeking an appeal. There are several third-party defendants in the litigation and MPL has asserted cross-claims in contribution against the various third-party defendants. This litigation is currently pending in the Third Judicial Circuit Court, Madison County, Illinois. While the ultimate outcome of these litigated matters remains uncertain, neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to this matter can be determined at this time and the Partnership is unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or range of loss) for this litigation. Under the omnibus agreement, MPC will indemnify the Partnership for the full cost of any losses should MPL be deemed responsible for any damages in this lawsuit. 
    
  Environmental Proceedings 
    
  As reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, on May 18, 2016, MarkWest Liberty Midstream received a draft Consent Order from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection ( WVDEP ) alleging certain air permitting and emissions violations at our Sherwood Facility, a gas processing facility located in West Virginia, including failure to comply with monitoring, tagging, recordkeeping and repair requirements with respect to certain equipment at the facility as well as the failure to comply with certain permit application requirements. On September 6, 2016, MarkWest Liberty Midstream executed a final Consent Order with the WVDEP resolving these matters. Pursuant to the final Consent Order, MarkWest Liberty Midstream paid a $95,000 civil penalty and agreed to implement certain enhancements in connection with our existing leak monitoring program, provide additional training, and provide funding for certain programs and equipment for the WVDEP which is expected to cost approximately $140,000. 
    
  As previously reported, in July 2015 representatives from the EPA and the United States Department of Justice conducted a raid on a MarkWest Liberty Midstream pipeline launcher/receiver site utilized for pipeline maintenance operations in Washington County, Pennsylvania pursuant to a search warrant issued by a magistrate of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. As part of this initiative, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, with the assistance of EPA s Criminal Investigation Division proceeded with an investigation of MarkWest s launcher/receiver, pipeline and compressor station operations. In response to the investigation, MarkWest initiated independent studies which demonstrated that there was no risk to worker safety and no threat of public harm associated with MarkWest s launcher/receiver operations. These findings were supported by a subsequent inspection and review by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. After providing these studies, and other substantial documentation related to MarkWest's pipeline and compressor stations, and arranging site visits and conducting several meetings with the government s representatives, on September 13, 2016, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania rendered a declination decision, dropping its criminal investigation and declining to pursue charges in this matter. 
    
  MarkWest Liberty Midstream continues to discuss with the EPA and the State of Pennsylvania alleged omissions associated with permits or related regulatory obligations for its launcher/receiver and compressor station facilities in the region. It is  
  
   74 

possible that in connection with any potential or asserted enforcement action associated with this matter, MarkWest Liberty Midstream will incur material assessments, penalties or fines, incur material defense costs and expenses, be required to modify operations or construction activities which could increase operating costs and capital expenditures, or be subject to other obligations or restrictions that could restrict or prohibit our activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The amount of any potential assessments, penalties, fines, restrictions, requirements, modifications, costs or expenses that may be incurred in connection with any potential enforcement action cannot be reasonably estimated or determined at this time. 
    
  We are involved in a number of environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

ARTICLE I 
  DEFINITIONS 
  Section 1.1        Definitions  .  The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly indicated to the contrary, applied to the terms used in this Agreement. 
     Acquiring Person    has the meaning set forth in the definition of  Elective Fundamental Change.   
     Acquisition    means any transaction in which any Group Member acquires (through an asset acquisition, stock acquisition, merger or other form of investment) control over all or a portion of the assets, properties or business of another Person for the purpose of increasing, over the long-term, the operating capacity or operating income of the Partnership Group from the operating capacity or operating income of the Partnership Group existing immediately prior to such transaction.  For purposes of this definition,  long-term  generally refers to a period of not less than twelve months. 
     Additional Book Basis    means the portion of any remaining Carrying Value of an Adjusted Property that is attributable to positive adjustments made to such Carrying Value as a result of Book-Up Events. For purposes of determining the extent that Carrying Value constitutes Additional Book Basis: 
  (a)        Any negative adjustment made to the Carrying Value of an Adjusted Property as a result of either a Book-Down Event or a Book-Up Event shall first be deemed to offset or decrease that portion of the Carrying Value of such Adjusted Property that is attributable to any prior positive adjustments made thereto pursuant to a Book-Up Event or Book-Down Event; and 
  (b)        If  Carrying Value that constitutes Additional Book Basis is reduced as a result of a Book-Down Event and the Carrying Value of other property is increased as a result of such Book-Down Event, an allocable portion of any such increase in Carrying Value shall be treated as Additional Book Basis;   provided  , that the amount treated as Additional Book Basis pursuant hereto as a result of such Book-Down Event shall not exceed the amount by which the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments after such Book-Down Event exceeds the remaining Additional Book Basis attributable to all of the Partnership s Adjusted Property after such Book-Down Event (determined without regard to the application of this   clause (b)   to such Book-Down Event).

To the extent that the Additional Book Basis attributable to all of the Partnership s Adjusted Property as of the beginning of any taxable period exceeds the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments as of the beginning of such period (the    Excess Additional Book Basis   ), the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items for such period shall be reduced by the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items determined without regard to this sentence as the Excess Additional Book Basis bears to the Additional Book Basis as of the beginning of such period. With respect  
  
   2 

to a Disposed of Adjusted Property, the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items shall be the amount of Additional Book Basis taken into account in computing gain or loss from the disposition of such Disposed of Adjusted Property.

The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital Account is intended to comply with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

Record Holders of Partnership Interests and, where appropriate, Derivative Partnership Interests, shall be recorded in the Partnership Register and ownership of such interests shall be evidenced by a physical certificate or book entry notation in the Partnership Register. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless the General Partner shall determine otherwise in respect of some or all of any or all classes of Partnership Interests, Partnership Interests shall not be evidenced by physical certificates.

The signatures of such officers upon a certificate may, to the extent permitted by law, be facsimiles. In case any officer who has signed or whose signature has been placed upon such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Partnership with the same effect as if he or she were such officer at the date of its issuance. If a Transfer Agent has been appointed for a class of Partnership Interests, no Certificate for such class of Partnership Interests shall be valid for any purpose until it has been countersigned by the Transfer Agent;   provided  ,   however  , that, if the General Partner elects to cause the Partnership to issue Partnership Interests of such class in global form, the Certificate shall be valid upon receipt of a certificate from the Transfer Agent certifying that the Partnership Interests have been duly registered in accordance with the directions of the Partnership. With respect to any Partnership Interests that are represented by physical certificates, the General Partner may determine that such Partnership Interests will no longer be represented by physical certificates and may, upon written notice to the holders of such Partnership Interests and subject to applicable law, take whatever actions it deems necessary or appropriate to cause such Partnership Interests to be registered in book entry or global form and may cause such physical certificates to be cancelled or deemed cancelled. 
  Section 4.2        Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates  . 
  (a)        If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent, the appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate evidencing the same number and type of Partnership Interests as the Certificate so surrendered. 
  (b)        The appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute and deliver, and the Transfer Agent shall countersign, a new Certificate in place of any Certificate previously issued, if the Record Holder of the Certificate: 
  (i)        makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, that a previously issued Certificate has been lost, destroyed or stolen; 

37 

(ii)        requests the issuance of a new Certificate before the General Partner has notice that the Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good faith and without notice of an adverse claim; 
  (iii)        if requested by the General Partner, delivers to the General Partner a bond, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, with surety or sureties and with fixed or open penalty as the General Partner may direct to indemnify the Partnership, the Partners, the General Partner and the Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged loss, destruction or theft of the Certificate; and 
  (iv)        satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the General Partner or the Transfer Agent. 
  If a Limited Partner fails to notify the General Partner within a reasonable period of time after such Limited Partner has notice of the loss, destruction or theft of a Certificate, and a transfer of the Limited Partner Interests represented by the Certificate is registered before the Partnership, the General Partner or the Transfer Agent receives such notification, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Limited Partner shall be precluded from making any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or the Transfer Agent for such transfer or for a new Certificate. 
  (c)        As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this   Section 4.2  , the General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Transfer Agent) reasonably connected therewith. 
  Section 4.3        Record Holders  .  The names and addresses of Unitholders as they appear in the Partnership Register shall be the official list of Record Holders of the Partnership Interests for all purposes. The Partnership and the General Partner shall be entitled to recognize the Record Holder as the Partner with respect to any Partnership Interest and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such Partnership Interest on the part of any other Person or Group, regardless of whether the Partnership or the General Partner shall have actual or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by law or any applicable rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading. Without limiting the foregoing, when a Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as nominee, agent or in some other representative capacity for another Person or Group in acquiring and/or holding Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership on the one hand, and such other Person on the other, such representative Person shall be the Limited Partner with respect to such Partnership Interest upon becoming the Record Holder in accordance with   Section 10.1(b)   and have the rights and obligations of a Partner hereunder as, and to the extent, provided herein, including   Section 10.1(c)  .

Any transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in accordance with this   Article IV   shall be null and void, and the Partnership shall have no obligation to effect any such transfer or purported transfer. 
  (c)        Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent or limit a disposition by any stockholder, member, partner or other owner of the General Partner or any Limited Partner of any or all of such Person s shares of stock, membership interests, partnership interests or other ownership interests in the General Partner or such Limited Partner and the term  transfer  shall not include any such disposition. 
  Section 4.5        Registration and Transfer of Limited Partner Interests  . 
  (a)        The General Partner shall maintain, or cause to be maintained by the Transfer Agent in whole or in part, the Partnership Register on behalf of the Partnership. 
  (b)        The General Partner shall not recognize any transfer of Limited Partner Interests evidenced by Certificates until the Certificates evidencing such Limited Partner Interests are duly endorsed and surrendered for registration of transfer. No charge shall be imposed by the General Partner for such transfer;   provided  ,   however  , that as a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this   Section 4.5  , the General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for registration of transfer of any Limited Partner Interests evidenced by a Certificate, and subject to the provisions of this   Section 4.5(b)  , the appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute and deliver, and in the case of Certificates evidencing Limited Partner Interests for which a Transfer Agent has been appointed, the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver, in the name of the holder or the designated transferee or transferees, as required pursuant to the holder s instructions, one or more new Certificates evidencing the same aggregate number and type of Limited Partner Interests as was evidenced by the Certificate so surrendered. Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate, such transfer shall be recorded in the Partnership Register. 
  (c)        Upon the receipt of proper transfer instructions from the Record Holder of uncertificated Partnership Interests, such transfer shall be recorded in the Partnership Register. 

39 

(d)        Except as provided in   Section 4.9  , by acceptance of any Limited Partner Interests pursuant to a transfer in accordance with this   Article IV  , each transferee of a Limited Partner Interest (including any nominee, or agent or representative acquiring such Limited Partner Interests for the account of another Person or Group) (i) shall be admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interests so transferred to such Person when any such transfer or admission is reflected in the Partnership Register and such Person becomes the Record Holder of the Limited Partner Interests so transferred, (ii) shall become bound, and shall be deemed to have agreed to be bound, by the terms of this Agreement, (iii) represents that the transferee has the capacity, power and authority to enter into this Agreement, (iv) makes the consents, acknowledgements and waivers contained in this Agreement, all with or without execution of this Agreement by such Person and (v) shall be deemed to certify that the transferee is not an Ineligible Holder.

  (c)        Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by the General Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest to another Person shall be  

40 

permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the rights and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion of Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner under the Delaware Act or cause the Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed) and (iii) such transferee also agrees to purchase all (or the appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of the partnership or membership interest owned by the General Partner as the general partner or managing member, if any, of each other Group Member. In the case of a transfer pursuant to and in compliance with this   Section 4.6  , the transferee or successor (as the case may be) shall, subject to compliance with the terms of   Section 10.2  , be admitted to the Partnership as the General Partner effective immediately prior to the transfer of the General Partner Interest, and the business of the Partnership shall continue without dissolution.

The Partnership may issue stop transfer instructions to any Transfer Agent in order to implement any restriction on transfer contemplated by this Agreement. 
  (b)        The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of Partnership Interests if it receives an Opinion of Counsel that such restrictions are necessary to (i) avoid a significant risk of the Partnership s becoming taxable as a corporation or otherwise becoming taxable as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed) or (ii) preserve the uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may impose such restrictions by amending this Agreement;   provided  ,   however  , that any amendment that would result in the delisting or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner Interests on the principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of Limited Partner Interests is then listed or admitted to trading must be approved, prior to such amendment being effected, by the holders of a majority of the Voting Eligible Limited Partner Interests of such class.

THE GENERAL PARTNER OF MPLX LP MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IF IT RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO AVOID A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF MPLX LP BECOMING TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE BECOMING TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THIS SECURITY MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON ITS TRANSFER PROVIDED IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. COPIES OF SUCH AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED AT NO COST BY WRITTEN REQUEST MADE BY THE HOLDER OF RECORD OF THIS SECURITY TO THE SECRETARY OF THE GENERAL PARTNER AT THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF THE PARTNERSHIP. THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE SETTLEMENT OF ANY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE FACILITIES OF ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THIS SECURITY IS LISTED OR ADMITTED TO TRADING.

  (b)        If any Limited Partner (or its beneficial owners) fails to furnish to the General Partner within 30 days of its request an Eligibility Certificate and other information related thereto, or if upon receipt of such Eligibility Certificate or other requested information the General Partner determines that a Limited Partner or a transferee of a Limited Partner is an Ineligible Holder, the Limited Partner Interests owned by such Limited Partner shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of   Section 4.10   or the General Partner may refuse to effect the transfer of the Limited Partner Interests to such transferee. In addition, the General Partner shall be substituted for any Limited Partner that is an Ineligible Holder as the Limited Partner in respect of the Ineligible Holder s Limited Partner Interests. 
  (c)        The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of Ineligible Holders, distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes of Limited Partners (including the General Partner and its Affiliates) in respect of Limited Partner Interests other than those of Ineligible Holders are cast, either for, against or abstaining as to the matter. 
  (d)        Upon dissolution of the Partnership, an Ineligible Holder shall have no right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to   Section 12.4   but shall be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall provide cash in exchange for an assignment of the Ineligible Holder s share of any distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Ineligible Holder of its Limited Partner Interest (representing the right to receive its share of such distribution in kind). 
  (e)        At any time after an Ineligible Holder can and does certify that it no longer is an Ineligible Holder, it may, upon application to the General Partner, request that with respect to any Limited Partner Interests of such Ineligible Holder not redeemed pursuant to   Section 4.10  , such Ineligible Holder upon approval of the General Partner, shall no longer constitute an Ineligible Holder and the General Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the Limited Partner in respect of such Limited Partner Interests. 
  (f)        If at any time a transferee of a Partnership Interest fails to furnish an Eligibility Certificate or any other information requested by the General Partner pursuant to   Section 4.9   within 30 days of such request, or if upon receipt of such Eligibility Certificate or other information the General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that such transferee is an Ineligible Holder, the Partnership may, unless the transferee establishes to the satisfaction  
  
   43 

of the General Partner that such transferee is not an Ineligible Holder, prohibit and void the transfer, including by placing a stop order with the Transfer Agent.

  (a)        If at any time a Limited Partner fails to furnish an Eligibility Certificate or any other information requested within the period of time specified in   Section 4.9  , or if upon receipt of such Eligibility Certificate or other information the General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner is an Ineligible Holder, the Partnership may, unless the Limited Partner establishes to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such Limited Partner is not an Ineligible Holder or has transferred his Limited Partner Interests to a Person who is not an Ineligible Holder and who furnishes an Eligibility Certificate to the General Partner prior to the date fixed for redemption as provided below, redeem the Limited Partner Interest of such Limited Partner as follows: 
  (i)        The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner, at such Limited Partner s last address designated on the records of the Partnership or the Transfer Agent, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The notice shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed. The notice shall specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for redemption, the place of payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon redemption of the Redeemable Interests (or, if later in the case of Redeemable Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests) and that on and after the date fixed for redemption no further allocations or distributions to which such Limited Partner would otherwise be entitled in respect of the Redeemable Interests will accrue or be made. 
  (ii)        The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests of each such class included among the Redeemable Interests. The redemption price shall be paid, as determined by the General Partner, in cash or by delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of the redemption price, bearing interest at the rate of 5% annually and payable in three equal annual installments of principal together with accrued interest, commencing one year after the redemption date. 
  (iii)        The Limited Partner or such Limited Partner s duly authorized representative shall be entitled to receive the payment for the Redeemable Interests at the place of payment specified in the notice of redemption on the redemption date (or, if later in the case of Redeemable Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner or Transferee at the place specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by an assignment duly executed in blank). 
  (iv)        After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer constitute issued and outstanding Limited Partner Interests. 
  
   44 

(b)        The provisions of this   Section 4.10   shall also be applicable to Limited Partner Interests held by a Limited Partner as nominee, agent or representative of a Person determined to be an Ineligible Holder. 
  (c)        Nothing in this   Section 4.10   shall prevent the recipient of a notice of redemption from transferring his Limited Partner Interest before the redemption date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement and the transferor provides notice of such transfer to the General Partner. Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw the notice of redemption,   provided   the transferee of such Limited Partner Interest certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such transferee is not an Ineligible Holder. If the transferee fails to make such certification within 30 days after the request and, in any event, before the redemption date, such redemption shall be effected from the transferee on the original redemption date.

  CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS 
  Section 5.1        Organizational Contributions  .  In connection with the formation of the Partnership under the Delaware Act, the General Partner made an initial Capital Contribution to the Partnership in the amount of $20.00, for a 2% General Partner Interest in the Partnership and has been admitted as the General Partner of the Partnership, and the Organizational Limited Partner made an initial Capital Contribution to the Partnership in the amount of $980.00 for a 98% Limited Partner Interest in the Partnership and has been admitted as a Limited Partner of the Partnership. As of the Closing Date, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the interest of the Organizational Limited Partner was partially redeemed in exchange for the return of the initial Capital Contribution of the Organizational Limited Partner, and 98% of any interest or other profit that may have resulted from the investment or other use of such initial Capital Contributions was allocated and distributed to the Organizational Limited Partner, and the balance thereof was allocated and distributed to the General Partner. The Organizational Limited Partner continued as a limited partner of the Partnership with respect to the portion of its interest that was not partially redeemed. 
  Section 5.2        Contributions by the General Partner  . 
  (a)        On the Closing Date and pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the General Partner contributed to the Partnership, as a Capital Contribution, the OLLC Interest (as defined in the Contribution Agreement) in exchange for (i) 1,508,225 General Partner Units representing a continuation of its 2% General Partner Interest, subject to all of the rights, privileges and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement, and (ii) the Incentive Distribution Rights. 
  (b)        Upon the issuance of any additional Limited Partner Interests by the Partnership (other than (i) the Common Units issued pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, (ii) the Common Units issued pursuant to   Section 5.3(a)  , (iii) any Common Units issued pursuant to   Section 5.11   and (iv) except as otherwise set forth in this   Section 5.2(b)  , any Common Units issued upon the conversion of any Partnership Interests), the General Partner may, in order to  
  
   45 

maintain the Percentage Interest with respect to its General Partner Interest, make additional Capital Contributions in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the quotient determined by dividing (x) the Percentage Interest with respect to the General Partner Interests immediately prior to the issuance of such additional Limited Partner Interests by the Partnership by (y) 100% less the Percentage Interest with respect to the General Partner Interest immediately prior to the issuance of such additional Limited Partner Interests by the Partnership times (B) the gross amount contributed to the Partnership by the Limited Partners (before deduction of underwriters  discounts and commissions) in exchange for such additional Limited Partner Interests. Any Capital Contribution pursuant to this   Section 5.2(b)   shall be evidenced by the issuance to the General Partner of a proportionate number of additional General Partner Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, with regard to the conversion of the Class B Units into Converted Common Units and Series A Preferred Units into Common Units, this   Section 5.2(b)   and the General Partner s right to make additional Capital Contributions shall be applicable upon the conversion of any Class B Unit to a Converted Common Unit pursuant to   Section 5.13   and Series A Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to   Section 5.14  , with the amount to be contributed by the General Partner being the amount necessary for the General Partner to have the same Percentage Interest after the conversion by reference to the then fair market value of a Common Unit. 
  Section 5.3        Contributions by Limited Partner  . 
  (a)        On the Closing Date, pursuant to and as described in the Contribution Agreement, MPLX Logistics Holdings contributed to the Partnership, as a Capital Contribution, all of MPLX Logistics Holdings  limited liability company interests in the Operating Company in exchange for (i) 19,651,515 Common Units, (ii) 36,951,515 Subordinated Units and (iii) a right to receive $149,144,119.22 as a reimbursement for certain capital expenditures incurred with respect to the assets of MPLX Logistics Holdings pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d). 
  (b)        On the Closing Date and pursuant to the IPO Underwriting Agreement, each IPO Underwriter contributed cash to the Partnership in exchange for the issuance by the Partnership of Common Units to each IPO Underwriter, all as set forth in the IPO Underwriting Agreement. 
  (c)        Upon the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option, (i) each IPO Underwriter contributed cash to the Partnership on the Option Closing Date in exchange for the issuance by the Partnership of Common Units to each IPO Underwriter, all as set forth in the IPO Underwriting Agreement and (ii) the Partnership redeemed an equivalent number of Common Units from the MPLX Logistics Holdings, all as set forth in the Contribution Agreement. 
  (d)        No Limited Partner Interests were issued or issuable as of or at the Closing Date other than (i) the Common Units and Subordinated Units issued to MPLX Logistics Holdings pursuant to   subparagraph (a)   of this   Section 5.3  , (ii) the Common Units issued to the IPO Underwriters as described in   subparagraphs (b)   and   (c)   of this   Section 5.3   and (iii) the Incentive Distribution Rights issued to the General Partner. 

46 

(e)        No Limited Partner will be required to make any additional Capital Contribution to the Partnership pursuant to this Agreement. 
  Section 5.4        Interest and Withdrawal  .  No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions. No Partner shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any, that distributions made pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of the Partnership may be considered as such by law and then only to the extent provided for in this Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, no Partner shall have priority over any other Partner either as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or distributions. Any such return shall be a compromise to which all Partners agree within the meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware Act. 
  Section 5.5        Capital Accounts  . 
  (a)        The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of Partnership Interests held by a nominee, agent or representative in any case in which such nominee, agent or representative has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to the General Partner) owning a Partnership Interest a separate Capital Account with respect to such Partnership Interest in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). The initial Capital Account balance attributable to the General Partner Units issued to the General Partner pursuant to   Section 5.2(a)   shall equal the Net Agreed Value of the Capital Contribution specified in   Section 5.2(a)  , which shall be deemed to equal the product of the number of General Partner Units issued to the General Partner pursuant to   Section 5.2(a)   and the Initial Unit Price for each Common Unit (and the initial Capital Account balance attributable to each General Partner Unit shall equal the Initial Unit Price for each Common Unit). The initial Capital Account balance attributable to the Common Units and Subordinated Units issued to MPLX Logistics Holdings pursuant to   Section 5.3(a)   shall equal the respective Net Agreed Value of the Capital Contributions specified in   Section 5.3(a)  , which shall be deemed to equal the product of the number of Common Units and Subordinated Units issued to MPLX Logistics Holdings pursuant to   Section 5.3(a)   and the Initial Unit Price for each such Common Unit and Subordinated Unit (and the initial Capital Account balance attributable to each such Common Unit and Subordinated Unit shall equal its Initial Unit Price). The initial Capital Account balance attributable to the Common Units issued to the IPO Underwriters pursuant to   Section 5.3(b)   shall equal the product of the number of Common Units so issued to the IPO Underwriters and the Initial Unit Price for each Common Unit (and the initial Capital Account balance attributable to each such Common Unit shall equal its Initial Unit Price). The initial Capital Account attributable to the Incentive Distribution Rights shall be zero. Thereafter, the Capital Account shall in respect of each such Partnership Interest be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the Partnership with respect to such Partnership Interest and (ii) all items of Partnership income and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance with   Section 5.5(b)   and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to   Section 6.1  , and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made with respect to such Partnership Interest and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with   Section 5.5(b)   and  
  
   47 

allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to   Section 6.1  . For the avoidance of doubt, the Series A Preferred Units will be treated as a partnership interest in the Partnership that is  convertible equity  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.721-2(g)(3), and, therefore, each holder of a Series A Preferred Unit will be treated as a partner in the Partnership. The initial Capital Account balance in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit shall be the Series A Issue Price, as such amount may be adjusted in accordance with the Series A Purchase Agreement for any reduction attributable to the Transaction Fee, as such term is defined in the Series A Purchase Agreement and expenses reimbursable under the Series A Purchase Agreement. 
  (b)        For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction that is to be allocated pursuant to   Article VI   and is to be reflected in the Partners  Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization used for that purpose),   provided   that: 
  (i)        Solely for purposes of this   Section 5.5  , the Partnership shall be treated as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the General Partner based upon the provisions of the applicable Group Member Agreement or governing, organizational or similar documents) of all property owned by (A) any other Group Member that is classified as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes and (B) any other partnership, limited liability company, unincorporated business or other entity classified as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes of which a Group Member is, directly or indirectly, a partner, member or other equity holder. 
  (ii)        All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to   Section 6.1  . 
  (iii)        Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the Partnership. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss. 
  (iv)        Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the Partnership s Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date. 

48 

(v)        An item of income of the Partnership that is described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) of the Code (with respect to items of income that are exempt from tax) shall be treated as an item of income for the purpose of this   Section 5.5(b)  , and an item of expense of the Partnership that is described in Section 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code (with respect to expenditures that are not deductible and not chargeable to capital accounts), shall be treated as an item of deduction for the purpose of this   Section 5.5(b)  . 
  (vi)        In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to   Section 5.5(d)   to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to depreciation, cost 
  recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be determined under the rules prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d)(2) as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment. 
  (vii)        To the extent required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-7, the Gross Liability Value of each Liability of the Partnership described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-7(b)(3)(i) shall be adjusted at such times as provided in this Agreement for an adjustment to Carrying Values. The amount of any such adjustment shall be treated for purposes hereof as an item of loss (if the adjustment increases the Carrying Value of such Liability of the Partnership) or an item of gain (if the adjustment decreases the Carrying Value of such Liability of the Partnership). 
  (c)        (i) Except as otherwise provided in this   Section 5.5(c)  , a transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a Pro Rata portion of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest so transferred. 
  (ii)        Reserved. 
  (iii)        Subject to   Section 6.8(b)  , immediately prior to the transfer of an Affiliate Retained Unit by a holder thereof (other than a transfer to an Affiliate unless the General Partner elects to have this   subparagraph 5.5(c)(iii)   apply), the Capital Account maintained for such Person with respect to its Affiliate Retained Units will (A) first, be allocated to the Affiliate Retained Units to be transferred in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Affiliate Retained Units to be transferred and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit, and (B) second, any remaining balance in such Capital Account will be retained by the transferor, regardless of whether it has retained any Affiliate Retained Units. Following any such allocation, the transferor s Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect to the retained Affiliate Retained Units, if any, will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under   clause (B)   hereinabove, and the transferee s Capital Account established with respect to the transferred Affiliate Retained Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under   clause (A)   above. 
  (iv)        Class B Unit and Converted Common Unit Capital Accounts. 
  
   49 

(A)        Upon conversion of the Class B-1 Units and Class B-2 Units into Converted Common Units, the Capital Account maintained for the holder of such converted Class B Units with respect to its Class B Units will (1) first, be allocated to the Converted Common Units held by such holder in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Converted Common Units and (y) the then Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit, and (2) second, any remaining balance in such Capital Account will be retained with respect to such holder s remaining Class B Units. 
  (B)        Subject to   Section 6.10  , immediately prior to the transfer of a Converted Common Unit by a holder thereof, the Capital Account maintained for such Person with respect to its Class B Units or Converted Common Units will (1) first, be allocated to the Converted Common Units to be transferred in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Converted Common Units to be transferred and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit, and (2) second, any remaining balance in such Capital Account will be retained by the transferor, regardless of whether it has retained any Class B Units or Converted Common Units.  Promptly following any such allocation, the transferor s Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect to the retained Class B Units or retained Converted Common Units, if any, will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under   clause (2)   hereinabove, and the transferee s Capital Account established with respect to the transferred Converted Common Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under   clause (1)   hereinabove. 
  (d)        (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration for the provision of services, or the conversion of the General Partner s Combined Interest to Common Units pursuant to   Section 11.3(b)  , the Capital Account of each Partner and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, and any such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be treated, for purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts, as if it had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value immediately prior to such issuance and had been allocated among the Partners at such time pursuant to   Section 6.1(c)   and   Section 6.1(d)   in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated;   provided  ,   however  , that in the event of an issuance of Partnership Interests for a de minimis amount of cash or Contributed Property, or in the event of an issuance of a de minimis amount of Partnership Interests as consideration for the provision of services, the General Partner may determine that such adjustments are unnecessary for the proper administration of the Partnership. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate fair market value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests shall be determined by the General Partner using such method of valuation as it may adopt. In making its determination of the fair market values of individual properties, the General Partner may determine that it is appropriate to first determine an aggregate value for the Partnership, derived from the current trading price of the Common Units, and taking fully into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time and make any adjustments necessary to reflect  
  
   50 

the difference, if any, between the fair market value of any Series A Preferred Units for which the Series A Conversion Date has not occurred and the aggregate Capital Accounts attributable to such Series A Preferred Units to the extent of any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss that has not been reflected in the Partners  Capital Accounts previously, consistent with the methodology of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2), and then allocate such aggregate value among the individual properties of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines appropriate). 
  (ii)        In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or 
  Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, and any such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be treated, for purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts, as if it had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and had been allocated among the Partners, at such time, pursuant to   Section 6.1(c)   and   Section 6.1(d)   in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate fair market value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual distribution that is not made pursuant to   Section 12.4   or in the case of a deemed distribution, be determined in the same manner as that provided in   Section 5.5(d)(i)   or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to   Section 12.4  , be determined by the Liquidator using such method of valuation as it may adopt. 
  (iii)        In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s), immediately after the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit into Common Units in accordance with   Section 5.14(b)(vi)  , the Capital Account of each Partner and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property shall be adjusted to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value immediately after such conversion and (A) first, all Unrealized Gain (if the Capital Account of each such Series A Conversion Unit is less than the Per Unit Capital Account for a then outstanding Initial Common Unit) or Unrealized Loss (if the Capital Account of each such Series A Conversion Unit is greater than the Per Unit Capital Account for a then outstanding Initial Common Unit) had been allocated to each Partner holding Series A Conversion Units received upon such conversion, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account of each such Series A Conversion Unit is equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then outstanding Initial Common Unit; and (B) second, any remaining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been allocated to the Partners at such time pursuant to   Section 6.1(c)   and   Section 6.1(d)  .  In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents) immediately after the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit shall be determined by the General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt;   provided  ,   however  , that the General Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into account the fair market  
  
   51 

value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time and must make such adjustments to such valuation as required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2).  The General Partner shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership in such manner as it determines in its discretion to be reasonable.  If, after making the allocations of Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss as set forth above in this   Section 5.5(d)(iii)  , the Capital Account of each Partner with respect to each Series A Conversion Unit received upon such conversion of the Series A Preferred Unit is different from the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then outstanding Initial Common Unit, then Capital Account balances shall be reallocated between the Partners holding Common Units (other than Series A Conversion Units) and Partners holding Series A Conversion Units so as to cause the Capital Account of each Partner holding a Series A Conversion Unit to equal, on a per Limited Partner Unit basis with respect to each such Series A Conversion Unit, the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then outstanding Initial Common Unit. 
  Section 5.6        Issuances of Additional Partnership Interests  . 
  (a)        Subject to   Section 5.14(b)(iv)  , the Partnership may issue additional Partnership Interests (other than General Partner Interests (except for General Partner Interests issued pursuant to   Section 5.2(b)  )) and Derivative Partnership Interests for any Partnership purpose at any time and from time to time to such Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as the General Partner shall determine, all without the approval of any Limited Partners. 
  (b)        Each additional Partnership Interest authorized to be issued by the Partnership pursuant to   Section 5.6(a)   may be issued in one or more classes, or one or more series of any such classes, with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing classes and series of Partnership Interests), as shall be fixed by the General Partner, including (i) the right to share in Partnership profits and losses or items thereof; (ii) the right to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and the terms and conditions upon which, the Partnership may or shall be required to redeem the Partnership Interest; (v) whether such Partnership Interest is issued with the privilege of conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon which each Partnership Interest will be issued, evidenced by Certificates and assigned or transferred; (vii) the method for determining the Percentage Interest as to such Partnership Interest; and (viii) the right, if any, of each such Partnership Interest to vote on Partnership matters, including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and privileges of such Partnership Interest. 
  (c)        The General Partner shall take all actions that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance of Partnership Interests and Derivative Partnership Interests pursuant to this   Section 5.6  , (ii) the conversion of the Combined Interest into Limited Partner Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (iii) the issuance of Common Units pursuant to   Section 5.11  , (iv) reflecting admission of such additional Limited Partners in the Partnership Register as the Record Holders of such Limited Partner Interests and (v) all additional issuances of Partnership Interests and Derivative Partnership Interests. The General Partner shall determine the relative rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Limited Partner Units or other Partnership Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests being so  
  
   52 

issued. The General Partner shall do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act and is authorized and directed to do all things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with any future issuance of Partnership Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests or in connection with the conversion of the Combined Interest into Limited Partner Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule, regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or any National Securities Exchange on which the Limited Partner Units or other Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading. 
  (d)        No fractional Limited Partner Units shall be issued by the Partnership. 
  Section 5.7        Reserved  . 
  Section 5.8        Limited Preemptive Right  .  Except as provided in this   Section 5.8   and in   Section 5.2   and   Section 5.11   or as otherwise provided in a separate agreement by the Partnership, no Person shall have any preemptive, preferential or other similar right with respect to the issuance of any Partnership Interest, whether unissued, held in the treasury or hereafter created. Other than with respect to the issuance of Partnership Interests in connection with the Initial Public Offering, the General Partner shall have the right, which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its Affiliates, to purchase Partnership Interests from the Partnership whenever, and on the same terms that, the Partnership issues Partnership Interests to Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates, to the extent necessary to maintain the Percentage Interests of the General Partner and its Affiliates equal to that which existed immediately prior to the issuance of such Partnership Interests. 
  Section 5.9        Splits and Combinations  . 
  (a)        Subject to   Section 5.9(e)  ,   Section 5.13(i)  ,   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E)  ,   Section 6.6   and   Section 6.9   (dealing with adjustments of distribution levels), the Partnership may make a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Interests to all Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Partnership Interests so long as, after any such event, each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Limited Partner Unit basis or stated as a number of Limited Partner Units (including the number of Common Units into which Class B Units and Series A Preferred Units may convert) are proportionately adjusted. 
  (b)        Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership Interests is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such notice (or such shorter periods as required by applicable law). The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Interests to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such calculation.

(c)        If a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Interests, or a subdivision or combination of Partnership Interests, is made as contemplated in this   Section 5.9  , the number of General Partner Units constituting the Percentage Interest of the General Partner (as determined immediately prior to the Record Date for such distribution, subdivision or combination) shall be appropriately adjusted as of the date of payment of such distribution, or the effective date of such subdivision or combination, to maintain such Percentage Interest of the General Partner. 
  (d)        Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the Partnership may issue Certificates or uncertificated Partnership Interests to the Record Holders of Partnership Interests as of the applicable Record Date representing the new number of Partnership Interests held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such changes. If any such combination results in a smaller total number of Partnership Interests outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of Partnership Interests represented by Certificates, the surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to such Record Date. 
  (e)        The Partnership shall not issue fractional Limited Partner Units or fractional General Partner Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Limited Partner Units or General Partner Units. If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Limited Partner Units or General Partner Units, as the case may be, would result in the issuance of fractional Limited Partner Units or General Partner Units but for the provisions of   Section 5.6(d)   and this   Section 5.9(e)  , each fractional Limited Partner Unit or General Partner Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Limited Partner Unit or General Partner Unit (with fractional Limited Partner Units or General Partner Units equal to or greater than a 0.5 Limited Partner Unit or General Partner Unit being rounded to the next higher Limited Partner Unit or General Partner Unit). 
  Section 5.10        Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner Interests  .  All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the requirements of, this   Article V   shall be fully paid and non-assessable Limited Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such non-assessability may be affected by Sections 17-303, 17-607 or 17-804 of the Delaware Act. 
  Section 5.11        Issuance of Common Units in Connection with Reset of Incentive Distribution Rights  . 
  (a)        Subject to the provisions of this   Section 5.11  , the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights) shall have the right, at any time when the Partnership has made a distribution pursuant to   Section 6.4(a)(v)   for each of the four most recently completed Quarters and the amount of each such distribution did not exceed Adjusted Operating Surplus for such Quarter, to make an election (the    IDR Reset Election   ) to cause the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and the Target Distributions to be reset in accordance with the provisions of   Section 5.11(e)   and, in connection therewith, the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will become entitled to receive their respective proportionate share  

54 

of a number of Common Units (the    IDR Reset Common Units   ) derived by dividing (i) the average amount of the aggregate cash distributions made by the Partnership for the two full Quarters immediately preceding the giving of the Reset Notice (as defined in   Section 5.11(b)  ) in respect of the Incentive Distribution Rights by (ii) the average of the cash distributions made by the Partnership in respect of each Common Unit for the two full Quarters immediately preceding the giving of the Reset Notice (the number of Common Units determined by such quotient is referred to herein as the    Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units   ).  If at the time of any IDR Reset Election the General Partner and its Affiliates are not the holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights, then the IDR Reset Election shall be subject to the prior written concurrence of the General Partner that the conditions described in the immediately preceding sentence have been satisfied. Upon the issuance of such IDR Reset Common Units, the Partnership will issue to the General Partner that number of additional General Partner Units equal to the product of (x) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Percentage Interest of the General Partner immediately prior to such issuance by (B) a percentage equal to 100% less such Percentage Interest by (y) the number of such IDR Reset Common Units, and the General Partner shall not be obligated to make any additional Capital Contribution to the Partnership in exchange for such issuance. The making of the IDR Reset Election in the manner specified in this   Section 5.11   shall cause the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and the Target Distributions to be reset in accordance with the provisions of   Section 5.11(e)   and, in connection therewith, the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will become entitled to receive IDR Reset Common Units and the General Partner will become entitled to receive General Partner Units on the basis specified above, without any further approval required by the General Partner or the Unitholders other than as set forth in this   Section 5.11(a)  , at the time specified in   Section 5.11(c)   unless the IDR Reset Election is rescinded pursuant to   Section 5.11(d)  . 
  (b)        To exercise the right specified in   Section 5.11(a)  , the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights) shall deliver a written notice (the    Reset Notice   ) to the Partnership. Within 10 Business Days after the receipt by the Partnership of such Reset Notice, the Partnership shall deliver a written notice to the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights of the Partnership s determination of the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units that each holder of Incentive Distribution Rights will be entitled to receive. 
  (c)        The holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will be entitled to receive the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units and the General Partner will be entitled to receive the related additional General Partner Units on the fifteenth Business Day after receipt by the Partnership of the Reset Notice;   provided  ,   however  , that the issuance of IDR Reset Common Units to the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights shall not occur prior to the approval of the listing or admission for trading of such IDR Reset Common Units by the principal National Securities Exchange upon which the Common Units are then listed or admitted for trading if any such approval is required pursuant to the rules and regulations of such National Securities Exchange. 

55 

(d)        If the principal National Securities Exchange upon which the Common Units are then traded has not approved the listing or admission for trading of the IDR Reset Common Units to be issued pursuant to this   Section 5.11   on or before the 30th calendar day following the Partnership s receipt of the Reset Notice and such approval is required by the rules and regulations of such National Securities Exchange, then the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights) shall have the right to either rescind the IDR Reset Election or elect to receive other Partnership Interests having such terms as the General Partner may approve, with the approval of the Conflicts Committee, that will provide (i) the same economic value, in the aggregate, as the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units would have had at the time of the Partnership s receipt of the Reset Notice, as determined by the General Partner, and (ii) for the subsequent conversion of such Partnership Interests into Common Units within not more than 12 months following the Partnership s receipt of the Reset Notice upon the satisfaction of one or more conditions that are reasonably acceptable to the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights). 
  (e)        The Minimum Quarterly Distribution and the Target Distributions shall be adjusted at the time of the issuance of IDR Reset Common Units or other Partnership Interests pursuant to this   Section 5.11   such that (i) the Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall be reset to equal the average cash distribution amount per Common Unit for the two Quarters immediately prior to the Partnership s receipt of the Reset Notice (the    Reset MQD   ), (ii) the First Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 115% of the Reset MQD, (iii) the Second Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 125% of the Reset MQD and (iv) the Third Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 150% of the Reset MQD. 
  (f)        Upon the issuance of IDR Reset Common Units pursuant to   Section 5.11(a)  , the Capital Account maintained with respect to the Incentive Distribution Rights will (i) first, be allocated to IDR Reset Common Units in an amount equal to the product of (A) the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit, and (ii) second, as to any remaining balance in such Capital Account, will be retained by the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights. If there is not sufficient capital associated with the Incentive Distribution Rights to allocate the full Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit to the IDR Reset Common Units in accordance with   clause (i)   of this   Section 5.11(f)  , the IDR Reset Common Units shall be subject to   Sections 6.1(d)(x)(B)   and   (C)  . 
  Section 5.12        [Reserved.]   
  Section 5.13        Establishment of Class B Units  . 
  (a)        Designation  . Pursuant to the First Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, there was created a class of Limited Partner Units designated as    Class B Units    and consisting of a total of 7,981,756 Class B Units, with the designations, preferences and  

56 

relative, participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties as set forth in this   Section 5.13  . 
  (b)        Series  . Of the aggregate number of Class B Units authorized pursuant to   Section 5.13(a)  , 3,990,878 are designated as    Class B-1 Units    and 3,990,878 are designated as    Class B-2 Units  .     The Class B-1 Units converted into Common Units on July 1, 2016.   
  (c)        Distributions  . Prior to its conversion into a Common Unit in accordance with   Section 5.13(f)   or   Section 5.13(g)  , and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a Class B Unit shall not be entitled to receive any distributions pursuant to this Agreement. 
  (d)        Voting Rights  . The Class B Units prior to conversion shall not be entitled to (i) vote with the Common Units as a single class on any matters on which holders of Common Units are entitled to vote (including the matters described in   Section 5.13(g)(iv)(B)  ) or (ii) vote as a separate class on any matters;   provided   that, notwithstanding the foregoing, but without limiting the General Partner s authority to adopt amendments to this Agreement without the approval of any Partners or Assignees as contemplated in   Section 13.1  , the Class B Units shall be entitled to vote as a separate class on any matter that disproportionately and adversely affects the rights or preferences of the Class B Units in relation to other classes of Partnership Interests, including matters subject to   Section 13.3(c)   that meet the foregoing requirement, but in each case subject to   Section 14.3  , and such separate class vote shall apply to matters otherwise approved pursuant to   Section 13.3(d)   or   Section 13.3(e)   solely to the extent they disproportionately and adversely affect the rights or preferences of the Class B Units in relation to other classes of Partnership Interests. The approval of a majority of the Class B Units shall be required to approve any matter for which the holders of the Class B Units are so entitled to vote as a separate class. For such matters Class B Units are entitled to vote upon, each Class B Unit will be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of Common Units into which a Class B Unit is convertible pursuant to   Section 5.13(f)   at the time of the record date for the vote or written consent on the matter. 
  (e)        Registrar and Transfer Agent/Certificates  . The Class B Units shall be recorded in the Partnership Register and the ownership of the Class B Units (including the restrictions on transfer set forth in   Exhibit B  ) shall be evidenced by book entry notation in the Partnership Register. 
  (f)        Conversion  . Except as provided in this   Section 5.13(f)   and   Section 5.13(g)  , the Class B Units are not convertible into Common Units. Each outstanding Class B-1 Unit and Class B-2 Unit shall automatically convert into a number of Common Units equal to the Conversion Number on the applicable Class B Conversion Date without any further action by the holders thereof. The terms of a Class B Unit will be changed, automatically and without further action, on the applicable Class B Conversion Date so that such Class B Unit is converted into a number of Common Units equal to the Conversion Number on such Class B Conversion Date and, immediately thereafter, such Class B Unit shall not be outstanding;   provided  ,   however  , that each Converted Common Unit will become outstanding and will remain subject to the provisions of   Section 6.1(d)(x)   and   Section 6.10  . 

57 

(g)        Fundamental Change  .  
  (i)        The Partnership may elect (a    Partnership Fundamental Change Election   ) to convert all, but not less than all, of the Class B Units into Common Units immediately prior to the consummation of an Elective Fundamental Change subject to the terms and conditions of this   Section 5.13(g)  . If the Partnership desires to make a Partnership Fundamental Change Election it shall, not less than 15 days prior to the date of the expected consummation of an Elective Fundamental Change, send a written notice to each holder of Class B Units: (A) describing the transaction or transactions that constitute such Elective Fundamental Change; (B) stating the expected date of consummation of such Elective Fundamental Change and the Partnership s computation of the number of Common Units into which each Class B-1 Unit and Class B-2 Unit would be converted pursuant to a Fundamental Change Conversion on such expected consummation date; and (C) stating that the Partnership has made a Partnership Fundamental Change Election with respect to such Elective Fundamental Change. The Partnership may, by written notice to the holders of Class B Units, revoke a Partnership Fundamental Change Election at any time prior to the 15  th   day prior to the date of the consummation of the applicable Elective Fundamental Change;   provided,   that the Partnership thereafter (or simultaneously therewith) timely sends the notice to the holders of Class B Units contemplated by   Section 5.13(g)(ii)  . 
  (ii)        If the Partnership does not elect to timely make a Partnership Fundamental Change Election with respect to any Elective Fundamental Change or revokes such an election in accordance with   Section 5.13(g)(i)  , then the Partnership shall, not less than 15 days prior to the date of the consummation of an Elective Fundamental Change, send a written notice to each holder of Class B Units: (A) describing the transaction or transactions that constitute such Elective Fundamental Change; and (B) stating the expected date of consummation of such Elective Fundamental Change and the Partnership s computation of the number of Common Units into which each Class B-1 Unit and Class B-2 Unit would be converted pursuant to a Fundamental Change Conversion on such expected consummation date. No later than ten days following delivery of the notice provided for in the previous sentence, the holders of Class B Units may, in their sole discretion, deliver to the Partnership a written notice executed by holders of a majority of the Class B Units, electing (a    Class B Unitholder Fundamental Change Election   ) to convert all, but not less than all, of the Class B Units into Common Units immediately prior to the consummation of an Elective Fundamental Change subject to the terms and conditions of this   Section 5.13(g)  . Any notice from the holders of Class B Units so electing a Class B Unitholder Fundamental Change Election (x) shall be binding upon all holders of Class B Units and shall provide for the conversion of all Class B Units even if less than all of the Class B Units delivered the Class B Unitholder Fundamental Change Election, and (y) may be conditioned on consummation of the applicable Elective Fundamental Change on or prior to a date specified in such notice. 
  (iii)        If  (A)  the Partnership timely makes and does not revoke a Partnership Fundamental Change Election in accordance with   Section 5.13(g)(i)  , (B) the holders of the Class B Units timely make a Class B Unitholder Fundamental Change Election in accordance with   Section 5.13(g)(ii)  , or (C) the Partnership is to be dissolved in accordance with  

58 

this Agreement (the event described in this   clause (C)  , and any event constituting an Elective Fundamental Change, each a    Fundamental Change   ), then, immediately prior to the consummation of the Fundamental Change, each outstanding Class B-1 Unit and Class B-2 Unit shall convert (a    Fundamental Change Conversion   ) into the number of Common Units equal to the applicable Discounted Conversion Number as of the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Change without any further action by the holders thereof. The terms of each Class B Unit will be changed, automatically and without further action, on the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Change so that each Class B Unit is so converted into such number of Common Units as of the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Change and, immediately thereafter, such Class B Unit shall not be outstanding;   provided  ,   however  , that each Converted Common Unit will become outstanding and will remain subject to the provisions of   Section 6.1(d)(x)  . 
  (iv)        For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that a Fundamental Change Conversion occurs in respect of any Fundamental Change pursuant to this   Section 5.13(g)  , the Converted Common Units issued as a result thereof shall (A) be entitled to participate in such Fundamental Change on an as-converted basis and to receive the consideration to which a Common Unit is entitled upon the consummation of such Fundamental Change and (B) not have any right to vote in respect of such Fundamental Change or any related matter. 
  (h)        Extraordinary Partnership Transactions  . Except to the extent that any such event is a Fundamental Change in respect of which a Fundamental Change Conversion occurs pursuant to   Section 5.13(g)  , prior to the consummation of any merger, consolidation or other business combination in which the Partnership will not be the surviving entity, the Partnership shall make appropriate provision to ensure that the holders of Class B Units receive in such transaction a security, issued by the Person surviving or resulting from such transaction and containing provisions substantially equivalent to this   Section 5.13   as determined reasonably in good faith by the General Partner and such other provisions of this Agreement as are applicable to the establishment of the designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of the Class B Units (an    Equivalent Security   ), including appropriate provision to ensure that the holders of Class B Units would be entitled to receive upon subsequent conversion of such Equivalent Security consideration equivalent to that which each holder of a Class B Unit would have been entitled if such Class B Unit had been converted into Common Units in connection with such Fundamental Change, with appropriate provision being made to account for the Discounted Conversion Numbers that would apply on any successive conversion of any such Equivalent Security. 
  (i)        Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by the Partnership  . If, prior to the Final Class B Conversion Date, the Partnership: (A) makes a distribution on its Common Units in Common Units; (B) subdivides or splits its Common Units into a greater number of Common Units; (C) combines or reclassifies its Common Units into a smaller number of Common Units; or (D) issues by reclassification of its Common Units any Partnership Interests (including any reclassification in connection with a merger, consolidation, or business combination in which the Partnership is the surviving entity), then the Conversion  

59 

Number, each Discounted Conversion Number in effect at the time of the Record Date for such distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, split, combination or reclassification and all Discounted Conversion Numbers that may be applicable from time to time after such date, shall be proportionally adjusted based on the number of Common Units (or any Partnership Interests into which such Common Units would have been merged, consolidated or combined pursuant to   clause (D)   above) that a holder of one Class B Unit would have been entitled to receive had such Class B Unit been entitled to be (and had) converted, immediately prior to such Record Date or effective date, into a number of Common Units (or any Partnership Interests into which such Common Units would have been merged, consolidated or combined pursuant to   clause (D)   above) equal to the Conversion Number then in effect.  An adjustment made pursuant to this   Section 5.13(i)   shall become effective immediately after the Record Date in the case of a distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, split, combination or reclassification. Adjustments shall be made successively pursuant to this   Section 5.13(i)   whenever any event described in this   Section 5.13(i)   shall occur. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment would be made pursuant to   clause (D)   above in respect of any Fundamental Change where the Partnership or the holders of Class B Units elect to convert the Class B Units into Common Units in connection with such Fundamental Change. 
  (j)        No Fractional Converted Common Units  . Notwithstanding anything in this   Section 5.13  , no fractional Common Units shall be issued upon any conversion of Class B Units into Converted Common Units in accordance with   Section 5.13(f)   or   Section 5.13(g)  . All Common Units (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one Class B Unit by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional Common Unit. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a Common Unit, the Partnership shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional Common Units, at the Partnership s option, either round each fractional Common Unit to the nearest whole Common Unit (and a 0.5 Common Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Common Unit) or pay the holder otherwise entitled to such fractional Common Unit a sum in cash determined by reference to the Current Market Price of a Common Unit on the date of such conversion. 
  (k)        Surrender of Certificates  . Subject to the requirements of   Section 6.10  , upon a conversion of Class B Units into Common Units in accordance with   Section 5.13(f)   or   Section 5.13(g)  , the Partnership shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office, to such holder of Class B Units, one or more certificates, registered in the name of such holder, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated certificates, for the number of Common Units and, if applicable, Class B Units, to which such holder shall then be entitled. Such a conversion shall be deemed to have been made as of the applicable Class B Conversion Date, and the Person entitled to receive the Common Units issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such Common Units as of such date. 
  (l)        Initial Capital Account  . The Capital Account with respect to each Class B Unit as of December 4, 2015 shall equal the Class B Target Capital Amount as of such date. 
  
   60 

(m)        Restrictions on Transfer  .  For purposes of this   Section 5.13(m)  , the term    transfer  ,  shall be deemed to refer to a transaction by which the holder of a Class B Unit directly or indirectly assigns such Class B Unit to another Person, and includes (i) a sale, assignment, gift, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any other disposition by operation of law or otherwise and (ii) entry into any swap or other transaction or arrangement that transfers or that is designed to, or that might reasonably be expected to, result in the transfer to another Person, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such Class B Unit. 
  (i)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, without the prior approval of the Board of Directors, M R Liberty shall not transfer any Class B Units. Any subsequent transfer of Class B Units by a transferee so approved by the Board of Directors shall also require the prior written approval of the Board of Directors. 
  (ii)        For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the other restrictions set forth in this   Section 5.13(m)   and   Section 4.8(g)  , neither M R Liberty nor any other M R Group Member may in any case transfer Class B Units to an M R Group Member if such transfer has as a purpose the avoidance of or is otherwise undertaken in contemplation of avoiding the restrictions on transfers in this   Section 5.13(m)   or elsewhere in this Agreement (it being understood that the purpose of this   Section 5.13(m)   is to prohibit the transfer of Class B Units to an M R Group Member followed by a change in the relationship between the transferor and such M R Group Member (or a change of control of such transferor or M R Group Member) after the transfer, with the result and effect that the transferor has indirectly made a transfer of Class B Units by using an M R Group Member, which transfer would not have been directly permitted under this   Section 5.13(m)   had such change in such relationship occurred prior to such transfer). 
  (iii)        Upon reasonable request by the Partnership from time to time but no more often than quarterly, unless such a request is made in anticipation of any vote of the Record Holders of Limited Partner Units (or any class of Limited Partner Units), M R Liberty and each other M R Group Member who owns Limited Partner Units shall provide the Partnership with a written certification, signed by an executive officer of such Person (to the extent such Person is not a natural person), setting forth the number of Class B Units and the number of Common Units owned beneficially and of record by such Person. Each of M R Liberty and each other M R Group Member shall, upon the request of the Partnership, provide the Partnership with copies of records of any transfers of Class B Units or Common Units involving such Person. 
  Section 5.14        Establishment of Series A Preferred Units  . 
  (a)        General  .  Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, there was created a class of Limited Partner Units designated as  Series A Convertible Preferred Units  (the    Series A Preferred Units   ), with the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties as set forth in this   Section 5.14   and elsewhere in this Agreement.   

61 

(b)        Rights of Series A Preferred Units  . The Series A Preferred Units shall have the following rights, preferences and privileges and the Series A Preferred Unitholders shall be subject to the following duties and obligations: 
  (i)        Distributions  . 
  (A)        Subject to   Section 5.14(b)(i)(B)  , commencing with the Quarter ending on June 30, 2016, subject to   Section 5.14(b)(i)(D)  , the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units as of the applicable Record Date for each Quarter shall be entitled to receive, in respect of each outstanding Series A Preferred Unit, cumulative distributions in respect of such Quarter equal to the sum of (1) the Series A Distribution Amount for such Quarter and (2) any Series A Unpaid Cash Distributions (collectively, a    Series A Quarterly Distribution   ). Each Series A Quarterly Distribution shall be payable quarterly in cash within sixty (60) days after the end of the applicable Quarter (each such payment date, a    Series A Distribution Payment Date   ). If the General Partner establishes an earlier Record Date for any distribution to be made by the Partnership on other Partnership Interests in respect of any Quarter, then the Record Date established pursuant to this   Section 5.14(b)(i)   for a Series A Quarterly Distribution in respect of such Quarter shall be the same Record Date. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to   Section 5.14(b)(i)(D)  , the Series A Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any distributions made pursuant to   Section 6.4   for any Quarter so long as the Series A Quarterly Distribution has been declared and paid in accordance with this   Section 5.14(b)(i)   on the Series A Preferred Units with respect to such Quarter. 
  (B)        If the Partnership fails to pay in full the Series A Distribution Amount of any Series A Quarterly Distribution in cash when due for any Quarter, then from and after the first date of such failure and continuing until such failure is cured by payment in full in cash of all such arrearages, (1) the amount of such unpaid cash distributions (on a per Series A Preferred Unit basis,    Series A Unpaid Cash Distributions   ) unless and until paid will accrue and accumulate from and including the first day of the Quarter immediately following the Quarter in respect of which such payment is due until paid in full and (2) the Partnership shall not be permitted to, and shall not, declare or make, any distributions, redemptions or repurchases in respect of any Series A Junior Securities or Series A Parity Securities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Quarter for which the Partnership first failed to pay in full the Series A Distribution Amount of any Series A Quarterly Distribution in cash when due); provided, however, that distributions may be declared and paid on the Series A Preferred Units and the Series A Parity Securities so long as such distributions are declared and paid pro rata so that amounts of distributions declared per Series A Preferred Unit and Series A Parity Security shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and accumulated distributions per Series A Preferred Unit and Series A Parity Security bear to each other. 
  (C)        The aggregate Series A Distribution Amount shall be paid out of Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating Surplus for the applicable Quarter. To the extent that any portion of a Series A Quarterly Distribution with respect to any Quarter exceeds the amount of Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating Surplus for such Quarter, the amount of cash equal to the Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating Surplus for such  
  
   62 

Quarter will be paid to the Series A Preferred Unitholders Pro Rata and the balance of such Series A Quarterly Distribution shall be unpaid and shall constitute an arrearage and shall accrue and accumulate as set forth in   Section 5.14(b)(i)(B)  . 
  (D)        Notwithstanding anything in this   Section 5.14(b)(i)   to the contrary, with respect to any Series A Preferred Unit that is converted into a Common Unit, the Record Holder thereof shall not be entitled to a distribution in respect of such Series A Preferred Unit and a distribution in respect of such Common Unit with respect to the same period, but shall be entitled only to the distribution to be paid based upon the class of Limited Partner Units held as of the close of business on the applicable Record Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Series A  Conversion Date occurs prior to the close of business on a Record Date for payment of a distribution on the Common Units, the applicable Record Holder of Series A Preferred Units shall receive, with respect to any Series A Preferred Units that have converted into Common Units, only the distribution in respect of such Common Units with respect to such period. 
  (E)        Notwithstanding anything in   Article VI   to the contrary, the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights shall not be entitled to receive distributions or allocations of income or gain that correspond or relate to amounts distributed or allocated to Unitholders in respect of Series A Preferred Units. 
  (ii)        Issuance of the Series A Preferred Units  . Subject to   Section 5.14(b)(iv)  , the Series A Preferred Units shall be issued by the Partnership pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Series A Purchase Agreement.   
  (iii)        Voting Rights  . 
  (A)        Except as provided in   Section 5.14(b)(iii)(B)  , the Voting Eligible Series A Preferred Units shall have voting rights that are identical to the voting rights of the Common Units and shall vote with the Common Units as a single class, so that each Voting Eligible Series A Preferred Unit will be entitled to one vote for each Common Unit into which such Series A Preferred Unit would be convertible at the then applicable Series A Conversion Rate (regardless of whether the Series A Preferred Units are then convertible) on each matter with respect to which each Record Holder of a Common Unit is entitled to vote. Each reference in this Agreement to a vote of Record Holders of Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the Record Holders of Common Units and Series A Preferred Units, voting together as a single class during any period in which any Series A Preferred Units are outstanding. 
  (B)        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the Record Holders of the Series A Required Voting Percentage shall be required for any amendment to this Agreement or the Certificate of Limited Partnership (including by merger or otherwise or any amendment contemplated by and made in accordance with   Section 5.14(b)(iv)  ) that is materially adverse to any of the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series A Preferred Units.

Beginning with the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, and (ii) immediately prior to the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Partnership under   Section 12.4  , the Series A Preferred Units owned by any Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be convertible, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time upon the request of such Series A Preferred Unitholder, but not more than once per Quarter by such Series A Preferred Unitholder (inclusive of any conversion by such Series A Preferred Unitholder s Affiliates, with each Series A Preferred Unitholder and its Affiliates being entitled to a single conversion right per Quarter), into a number of Common Units determined by multiplying the number of Series A Preferred Units to be converted by the Series A Conversion Rate at such time    provided  ,   however  , that the Partnership shall not be obligated to honor any such conversion request if such conversion request does not involve an underlying value of Common Units of at least $100,000,000 (taking into account any concurrent conversion requests by any Affiliates of such Series A Preferred Unitholder) based on the Closing Price of Common Units on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Series A Conversion Notice Date (or a lesser amount to the extent such exercise covers all of such Series A Preferred Unitholder s Series A Preferred Units). Immediately upon the issuance of Common Units as a result of any conversion of Series A Preferred Units, all rights of the Series A Converting Unitholder with respect to such Series A Preferred Units shall cease, including any further accrual of distributions, and such Series A Converting Unitholder thereafter shall be treated for all purposes as the owner of Common Units. Fractional Common Units shall not be issued to any Person pursuant to this   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(A)   (each fractional Common Unit shall be rounded down with the remainder being paid an amount in cash based on the Closing Price of Common Units on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Series A Conversion Notice Date). 
  (B)        At the Option of the Partnership  . At any time following the fourth anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, the Partnership shall have the option at any  
  
   65

Fractional Common Units shall not be issued to any Person pursuant to this   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(B)   (each fractional Common Unit shall be rounded down with the remainder being paid an amount in cash based on the Closing Price of Common Units on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Series A Forced Conversion Notice Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for the Partnership to exercise such option: 
  (1)        The Closing Price of the Common Units must be equal to or greater than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Series A Issue Price for the twenty (20) Trading Day period immediately preceding the Series A Forced Conversion Notice Date; 
  (2)        The average daily trading volume of the Common Units on the National Securities Exchange on which the Common Units are then listed or admitted to trading must be equal to or exceed 1,000,000 (as such amount may be adjusted to reflect any Limited Partner Unit split, combination or similar event) for the twenty (20) Trading Day period immediately preceding the Series A Forced Conversion Notice Date  and 
  (3)        The Partnership must have an effective registration statement on file with the Commission covering resales of the underlying Common Units to be received upon any such conversion, and 
  provided  , that each such conversion by the Partnership shall be for an aggregate amount of Series A Preferred Units involving an underlying value of Common Units of at least $100,000,000  based on the Closing Price of Common Units on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Series A Forced Conversion Notice Date (or a lesser amount if such amount includes all then outstanding Series A Preferred Units) and shall be allocated among the Series A Preferred Unitholders on a Pro Rata basis or on such other basis as may be agreed upon by all Series A Preferred Unitholders. 
  (C)        Conversion Notice  . 
  (1)        To convert Series A Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(A)  , a Series A Converting Unitholder shall give written notice (a    Series A Conversion Notice  ,  and the date such notice is received, a    Series A Conversion Notice Date   ) to the Partnership stating that such Series A Preferred Unitholder elects to so convert Series A Preferred Units pursuant to   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(A)   and the number of Series A Preferred Units to be converted. 
  (2)        To convert Series A Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(B)  , the Partnership shall give written notice (a    Series A Forced Conversion Notice  ,  and the date such notice is received, a    Series A Forced Conversion Notice Date   ) to each Record Holder of Series A Preferred Units stating that the Partnership elects to force conversion of Series A Preferred Units pursuant to   Section    
  
   66 

5.14(b)(vi)(B)   and the number of Series A Preferred Units to be so converted. The Series A Conversion Units shall be issued in the name of the Record Holder of such Series A Preferred Units. 
  (D)        Timing  .

On the Series A Conversion Date, the Partnership shall instruct, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause, its Transfer Agent to electronically transmit the Series A Conversion Units issuable upon conversion to such Series A Preferred Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)), by crediting the account of the Series A Preferred Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)) prime broker with the Depository through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. The parties agree to coordinate with the Depository to accomplish this objective. Upon issuance of Series A Conversion Units to the Series A Converting Unitholder, all rights under the converted Series A Preferred Units shall cease, and such Series A Converting Unitholder shall be treated for all purposes as the Record Holder of such Series A Conversion Units. 
  (E)        Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by the Partnership  . If, after the Series A Issuance Date, the Partnership (i) makes a distribution on its Common Units payable in Common Units or another Partnership Interest, (ii) subdivides or splits its outstanding Common Units into a greater number of Common Units, (iii) combines or reclassifies its Common Units into a lesser number of Common Units, (iv) issues by reclassification of its Common Units any Partnership Interests (including any reclassification in connection with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person), (v) effects a Pro Rata repurchase of Common Units, in each case other than in connection with a Series A Change of Control (which shall be governed by   Section 5.14(b)(vii)  ), (vi) issues to holders of Common Units, in their capacity as holders of Common Units, rights, options or warrants entitling them to subscribe for or purchase Common Units at less than the market value thereof, (vii) distributes to holders of Common Units evidences of indebtedness, Partnership Interests (other than Common Units) or other assets (including securities, but excluding any distribution referred to in   clause (i)  , any rights or warrants referred to in   clause (ii)  , any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries and any distribution of Limited Partner Units or any class or series, or similar Partnership Interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of certain spin-off transactions described below), or (viii) consummates a spin-off, where the Partnership makes a distribution to all holders of Common Units consisting of Limited Partner Units of any class or series, or similar equity interests of, or relating to, a subsidiary or other business unit, then the Series A Conversion Rate, the Series A Conversion Floor Trigger and, solely for purposes of   Section 5.14(B)(vi)(b)(1)  , the Series A  
  
   67 

Issue Price, in each case, in effect at the time of the Record Date for such distribution or the effective date of any such other transaction shall be proportionately adjusted: (1) in respect of   clauses (i)   through   (iv)   above, so that the conversion of the Series A Preferred Units after such time shall entitle each Series A Preferred Unitholder to receive the aggregate number of Common Units (or any Partnership Interests into which such Common Units would have been combined, consolidated, merged or reclassified, as applicable) that such Series A Preferred Unitholder would have been entitled to receive if the Series A Preferred Units had been converted into Common Units immediately prior to such Record Date or effective date, as the case may be, (2) in respect of   clauses (v)   through   (viii)   above, in the reasonable discretion of the General Partner to appropriately ensure that the Series A Preferred Units are convertible into an economically equivalent number of Common Units after taking into account the event described in   clauses (vi)   through   (viii)   above, and (3) in addition to the foregoing, in the case of a merger, consolidation or business combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person, the Partnership shall provide effective provisions to ensure that the provisions in this   Section 5.14   relating to the Series A Preferred Units shall not be abridged or amended and that the Series A Preferred Units shall thereafter retain the same powers, economic rights, preferences and relative participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, that the Series A Preferred Units had immediately prior to such transaction or event, and, solely for purposes of   Section 5.14(B)(vi)(b)(1)  , the Series A Issue Price, and any other terms of the Series A Preferred Units that the General Partner in its reasonable discretion determines require adjustment to achieve the economic equivalence described below, shall be proportionately adjusted to take into account any such subdivision, split, combination or reclassification. An adjustment made pursuant to this   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E)   shall become effective immediately after the Record Date in the case of a distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination, reclassification (including any reclassification in connection with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person) or split. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event described above shall occur. 
  (F)        No Adjustments for Certain Items  . Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this   Section 5.14(b)(vi)  , no adjustment shall be made to the Series A Conversion Rate, the Series A Conversion Floor Trigger or the Series A Issue Price pursuant to   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E)   as a result of any of the following: 
  (1)        Any issuance of Partnership Interests in exchange for cash  
  (2)        Any grant of Common Units or options, warrants or rights to purchase or receive Common Units or the issuance of Common Units upon the exercise or vesting of any such options, warrants or rights in respect of services provided to or for the benefit of the Partnership or its Subsidiaries, under compensation plans and agreements approved by the General Partner (including any long-term incentive plan)   
  (3)        Any issuance of Common Units as all or part of the consideration to effect (i) the closing of any acquisition by the Partnership of assets or equity interests of a third party in an arm s-length transaction, (ii) closing of any acquisition by the  
  
   68 

Partnership of assets or equity interests of MPC or any of its Affiliates or (iii) the consummation of a merger, consolidation or other business combination of the Partnership with another entity in which the Partnership survives and the Common Units remain outstanding to the extent any such transaction set forth in   clause (i)  ,   (ii)   or   (iii)   above is validly approved by the General Partner; or 
  (4)        The issuance of Common Units upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Units, Series A Parity Securities or Class B Units. 
  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, whenever the issuance of a Partnership Interest or other event would require an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Rate under one or more provisions of this Agreement, only one adjustment shall be made to the Series A Conversion Rate in respect of such issuance or event. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E)  , unless otherwise determined by the General Partner, no adjustment to the Series A Conversion Rate, Series A Conversion Floor Trigger or the Series A Issue Price shall be made with respect to any distribution or other transaction described in   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(E)   if the Series A Preferred Unitholders are entitled to participate in such distribution or transaction as if they held a number of Common Units issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Units immediately prior to such event at the then applicable Series A Conversion Rate, without having to convert their Series A Preferred Units.   
  (G)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in   Section 5.14(b)(vii)   or elsewhere in this Agreement, in connection with any transaction pursuant to which MPC or any of its Affiliates (other than the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries) would acquire, (x) all of the Partnership s outstanding Common Units or (y) all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, in each case including by way of merger, consolidation, or otherwise (including any such transaction undertaken pursuant to   Section 15.1  ), then the Partnership shall have the right, by delivering written notice to the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units, to convert all, but not less than all, of the Series A Preferred Units into Common Units at the Series A COC Conversion Rate effective immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction. 
  (vii)        Series A Change of Control  .   
  (A)        Subject to   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(B)  , in the event of a Series A Cash COC Event, the outstanding Series A Preferred Units shall be automatically converted, without requirement of any action of the Series A Preferred Unitholders, into Common Units immediately prior to the closing of the Series A Cash COC Event at the Series A COC Conversion Rate.   
  (B)        Subject to   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(B)   and   Section 5.14(b)(vi)(G)  , at least ten (10) Business Days prior to consummating a Series A Change of Control (other than a Series A Cash COC Event), the Partnership shall provide written notice thereof to the Series A Preferred Unitholders.

69 

Unitholder, with respect to all but not less than all of its Series A Preferred Units, by notice given to the Partnership within five (5) Business Days of the date the Partnership provides written notice of the execution of definitive agreements that provide for such Series A Change of Control, shall be entitled to elect one of the following (with the understanding that any Series A Preferred Unitholder who fails to timely provide notice of its election to the Partnership shall be deemed to have elected the option set forth in   sub-clause (1)   below):  
  (1)        Convert all, but not less than all, of such Series A Preferred Unitholder s outstanding Series A Preferred Units into Common Units, at the then-applicable Series A Conversion Rate  
  (2)        If the Partnership will not be the surviving entity of such Series A Change of Control or the Partnership will be the surviving entity but its Common Units will cease to be listed or admitted to trading on a National Securities Exchange, require the Partnership to use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or to cause to be delivered to the Series A Preferred Unitholders, in exchange for their Series A Preferred Units upon such Series A Change of Control, a security in the surviving entity or the parent of the surviving entity that has substantially similar rights, preferences and privileges as the Series A Preferred Units, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the right to distributions equal in amount and timing to those provided in   Section 5.14(b)(i)   and a conversion rate proportionately adjusted such that the conversion of such security in the surviving entity or parent of the surviving entity immediately following the Series A Change of Control would entitle the Record Holder to the number of common securities of such entity (together with a number of common securities of equivalent value to any other assets received by holders of Common Units in such Series A Change of Control) which, if a Series A Preferred Unit had been converted into Common Units immediately prior to such Series A Change of Control, such Record Holder would have been entitled to receive immediately following such Series A Change of Control (such security in the surviving entity, a    Series A Substantially Equivalent Unit   )  provided, however, that, if the Partnership is unable to deliver or cause to be delivered Series A Substantially Equivalent Units to any Series A Preferred Unitholder in connection with such Series A Change of Control, each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be entitled to (I) require conversion or redemption of such Series A Preferred Units in the manner contemplated by   subclause (1)   or   (4)   of this   Section 5.14(b)(vii)(B)   (at such holder s election) or (II) convert the Series A Preferred Units held by such Series A Preferred Unitholder immediately prior to such Series A Change of Control into a number of Common Units at a conversion ratio equal to the quotient of:  (a) the product of (i) 160% multiplied by (ii) the Series A Issue Price less the Series A Preferred Unitholder s Pro Rata portion of the sum of all cash distributions paid on all Series A Preferred Units on or prior to the date of the Series A Change of Control, divided by (b) an amount equal to 95% of the volume-weighted average price of the Common Units for the thirty (30) Trading Day period prior to the closing of the Series A Change of Control  provided that such ratio shall in no event exceed a value per Series A Preferred Unit equal to (i) 120% of the Series A Issue Price in the case of a Series A Change of Control occurring on or prior to the first anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, (ii) 130% of the Series A Issue Price in the case of a Series A Change of Control occurring after the first anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date but on or prior to the second anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, and (iii) 140% of the Series A Issue Price in the case  
  
   70 

of a Series A Change of Control occurring after the second anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date but on or prior to the third anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date. 
  (3)        If the Partnership is the surviving entity of such Series A Change of Control, continue to hold Series A Preferred Units  or 
  (4)        Require the Partnership to redeem the Series A Preferred Units at a price per Series A Preferred Unit equal to 101% of the Series A Issue Price plus (x) Series A Unpaid Cash Distributions on the applicable Series A Preferred Unit and (y) Series A Partial Period Distributions on the applicable Series A Preferred Unit. Any redemption pursuant to this   sub-clause (4)   shall, as determined by the General Partner, be paid in cash and/or Common Units.

No later than three Trading Days prior to the consummation of the related Series A Change of Control, the Partnership shall deliver a written notice to the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units stating the date on which the Series A Preferred Units will be redeemed and the Partnership s computation of the amount of cash or Common Units to be received by the Record Holder upon redemption of such Series A Preferred Units. If the Partnership shall be the surviving entity of the related Series A Change of Control, then no later than 10 Business Days following the consummation of such Series A Change of Control, the Partnership shall remit the applicable cash or Common Unit consideration to the Record Holders of then outstanding Series A Preferred Units. If the Partnership shall not be the surviving entity of the related Series A Change of Control, then the Partnership shall remit the applicable cash or Common Unit immediately prior to the consummation of the Series A Change of Control.  The Record Holders shall deliver to the Partnership any Certificates representing the Series A Preferred Units as soon as practicable following the redemption. Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units shall retain all of the rights and privileges thereof unless and until the consideration due to them as a result of such redemption shall be paid in full in cash or Common Units, as applicable. After any such redemption, any such redeemed Series A Preferred Unit shall no longer constitute an issued and outstanding Limited Partner Interest.  
  (viii)        Series A Preferred Unit Transfer Restrictions  . 
  (A)        Notwithstanding any other provision of this   Section 5.14(b)(viii)  , each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be permitted to transfer any Series A Preferred Units owned by such Series A Preferred Unitholder to any of its Affiliates or to any other Series A Preferred Unitholder.

For purposes of this   Section 6.1(d)  , each Partner s Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this   Section 6.1(d)   and other than an allocation pursuant to   Section 6.1(d)(i)  ,   Section 6.1(d)(vi)   and   Section 6.1(d)(vii)   with respect to such taxable period. This   Section 6.1(d)(ii)   is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 
  (iii)        Priority Allocations  . 
  (A)        If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of any property distributed (except cash or property distributed pursuant to   Section 12.4   or with respect to Series A Preferred Units) with respect to a Limited Partner Unit exceeds the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of property distributed with respect to another Limited Partner Unit (the amount of the excess, an    Excess Distribution    and the Limited Partner Unit with respect to which the greater distribution is paid, an    Excess Distribution Unit   ), then (1) there shall be allocated gross income and gain to each Unitholder receiving an Excess Distribution with respect to the Excess Distribution Unit until the aggregate amount of such items allocated with respect to such Excess Distribution Unit pursuant to this   Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A)   for the current taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the amount of the Excess Distribution; and (2) the General Partner shall be allocated gross income and gain with respect to each such Excess Distribution in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (aa) the quotient determined by dividing (x) the General Partner s Percentage Interest at the time when the Excess Distribution occurs by (y) a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner s Percentage Interest at the time when the Excess Distribution occurs, times (bb) the total amount allocated in   clause (1)   above with respect to such Excess Distribution. 
  (B)        After the application of   Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A)   and   Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A)   and   (B)  , if the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of any property distributed (except cash or property distributed pursuant to   Section 12.4  ) to any Common Unitholder with respect to its Limited Partner Units for a taxable year is greater (on a per Limited Partner Unit basis) than the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of property distributed to the Class B Unitholders with respect to their Class B Units (on a per Limited Partner Unit basis), then gross income in an amount equal to the product of 60%, multiplied by the aggregate amount of such distribution shall be allocated to the holders of Common Units and General Partner Units, Pro Rata. 
  (C)        After the application of   Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A)   and   (B)  , all or any portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for the taxable period, if any, shall be allocated (1) to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata, until the aggregate amount of such items allocated to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights pursuant to this   Section 6.1(d)(iii)(B)   for the current taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the cumulative amount of all Incentive Distributions made to the holders of Incentive  
  
   77 

Distribution Rights from the Closing Date to a date 60 days after the end of the current taxable period; and (2) to the General Partner an amount equal to the product of (aa) an amount equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the General Partner s Percentage Interest by (y) the sum of 100 less the General Partner s Percentage Interest times (bb) the sum of the amounts allocated in   clause (1)   above. 
  (iv)        Qualified Income Offset  .  In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership gross income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible;   provided  ,   however  , that an allocation pursuant to this   Section 6.1(d)(iv)   shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account as adjusted after all other allocations provided for in this   Section 6.1   have been tentatively made as if this   Section 6.1(d)(iv)   were not in this Agreement. 
  (v)        Gross Income Allocation  .  In the event any Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital Account at the end of any taxable period in excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible;   provided  ,   however  , that an allocation pursuant to this   Section 6.1(d)(v)   shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit balance in its Capital Account as adjusted after all other allocations provided for in this   Section 6.1   have been tentatively made as if   Section 6.1(d)(iv)   and this   Section 6.1(d)(v)   were not in this Agreement. 
  (vi)        Nonrecourse Deductions  .  Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated to the Partners Pro Rata. If the General Partner determines that the Partnership s Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner is authorized, upon notice to the other Partners, to revise the prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements. 
  (vii)        Partner Nonrecourse Deductions  .  Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, the Partner Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such Economic Risk of Loss. 
  (viii)        Nonrecourse Liabilities  .  For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the Partnership in excess  
  
   78 

of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated among the Partners Pro Rata. 
  (ix)        Code Section 754 Adjustments  .  To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations. 
  (x)        Economic Uniformity; Changes in Law  . 
  (A)        [Reserved.] 
  (B)        With respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of Partnership property pursuant to   Section 5.5(d)   during any taxable period of the Partnership ending upon, or after, the issuance of Affiliate Retained Units pursuant to   Section 5.11  , any Unrealized Gains and Unrealized Losses shall be allocated among the Partners in a manner that to the nearest extent possible results in the Capital Accounts maintained with respect to such Affiliate Retained Units issued pursuant to   Section 5.11   equaling the product of (1) the Aggregate Quantity of Affiliate Retained Units and (2) the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit. 
  (C)        With respect to any taxable period during which an Affiliate Retained Unit is transferred to any Person who is not an Affiliate of the transferor, all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for such taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the transferor Partner of such transferred Affiliate Retained Unit until such transferor Partner has been allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such transferred Affiliate Retained Unit to an amount equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit. 
  (D)        For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof), the General Partner shall (1) adopt such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions; (2) make special allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction, Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss; and (3) amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may adopt such conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this Agreement as provided in this   Section 6.1(d)(x)(D)   only if such conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests issued and outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code. 
  
   79 

(E)        Except as addressed by   Section 6.1(d)(x)(H)  , with respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of Partnership property pursuant to   Section 5.5(d)   when a disparity exists between the Per Unit Capital Amounts of the Initial Common Units and the Converted Common Units, any Unrealized Gains and Unrealized Losses shall be allocated among (x) the General Partner, in accordance with its Percentage Interest, and the holders of Common Units other than the Converted Common Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner s Percentage Interest, and (y) the General Partner, in accordance with its Percentage Interest, and the holders of Converted Common Units a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner s Percentage Interest, in a manner that to the nearest extent possible results in the elimination of such disparity between the Per Unit Capital Amounts of the Initial Common Units and the Converted Common Units. 
  (F)        With respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of Partnership property pursuant to   Section 5.5(d)   when a disparity exists between the Per Unit Capital Amounts of a Class B Unit and the Class B Target Capital Amount at such time, any Unrealized Gains and Unrealized Losses shall be allocated among (x) the General Partner, in accordance with its Percentage Interest, and the holders of Common Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner s Percentage Interest, and (y) the General Partner, in accordance with its Percentage Interest, and the holders of Class B Units, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner s Percentage Interest, in a manner that to the nearest extent possible results in the elimination of such disparity between the Per Unit Capital Amounts of a Class B Unit and the Class B Target Capital Amount. 
  (G)        At the election of the General Partner, with respect to any taxable period, subject to the priorities established herein for the Series A Preferred Units (including pursuant to   Section 6.1(d)(xi)  ) all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income, gain, loss or deduction for such taxable period shall be allocated to each Partner holding Converted Common Units in the proportion of the number of Converted Common Units held by such Partner to the total number of Converted Common Units then outstanding, until each such Partner has been allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such Converted Common Units to an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Converted Common Units held by such Partner and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount of an Initial Common Unit. The purpose of this allocation is to establish uniformity between the Capital Accounts underlying Converted Common Units and those Capital Accounts underlying other Common Units immediately prior to the transfer or other disposition of a Converted Common Unit. This allocation method for establishing such economic uniformity will only be available to the General Partner if the method for allocating the Capital Account maintained with respect to the holder of Converted Common Units between the transferred and retained Converted Common Units pursuant to   Section 5.5(c)(iv)   does not otherwise provide such economic uniformity to the transferred Converted Common Units. 
  (H)        After the conversion of any Class B Units based upon the Discounted Conversion Number, all or a portion of the remaining items of Net Termination Loss, Net Loss, and if necessary gross loss and deduction, for the taxable period in which such conversion occurs shall be allocated 100% to Partners holding the Converted Common Units 
  
   80 

(which were converted based upon such Discounted Conversion Number) in the proportion of the number of such Converted Common Units held by such Partners, until each such Partner has been allocated the minimum amount necessary to reduce the Capital Account of each such Converted Common Unit to the Per Unit Capital Amount of an Initial Common Unit;   provided   that, to the extent possible, a portion of such allocation shall consist of gross operating loss equal to the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount of the incremental Section 704(c) income allocations allocated to the Class B Units converted based upon the Discounted Conversion Number for the current and prior taxable periods relating to the built-in gain value discrepancy between the Discounted Conversion Number and the Adjusted Class B Conversion Number with respect to the Class B Units converted based upon the Discounted Conversion Number and (y) the aggregate amount of taxable income that has been allocated the Class B Units converted based upon the Discounted Conversion Number for the current and prior taxable periods. 
  (I)        The provisions of this   Section 6.1(d)(x)   shall also be subject to the limitations and requirements of   Section 6.10  , as applicable. 
  (xi)        Allocations with Respect to Series A Preferred Units  . 
  (A)        Items of Partnership gross income shall be allocated to the Series A Preferred Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the aggregate amount of gross income allocated to each Series A Preferred Unitholder pursuant hereto for the current taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the cumulative amount of all cash distributions made with respect to such Series A Preferred Unit pursuant to   Section 5.14(b)(i)   from the date such Series A Preferred Unit was issued to a date 60 days after the end of the current taxable year. 
  (B)        Items of Partnership gross income shall be allocated to the Series A Preferred Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the aggregate amount of gross income allocated to each Series A Preferred Unitholder pursuant hereto for the current taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the cumulative amount of all Net Losses allocated to such Series A Preferred Unitholder pursuant to   Section 6.1(b)(iii)   for all previous taxable years. 
  (C)        Notwithstanding any other provision of this   Section 6.1   (other than the Required Allocations), if (A) the Liquidation Date occurs prior to the conversion of the last outstanding Series A Preferred Unit and (B) after having made all other allocations provided for in this   Section 6.1   for the taxable period in which the Liquidation Date occurs, the Per Unit Capital Amount of each Series A Preferred Unit would not equal or exceed the Series A Liquidation Value, then items of income, gain, loss and deduction for such taxable period shall instead be allocated among the Partners in a manner determined appropriate by the General Partner so as to cause, to the maximum extent possible, the Per Unit Capital Amount in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit to equal the Series A Liquidation Value (and no other allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall reverse the effect of such allocation). For the avoidance of doubt, the reallocation of items set forth in the immediately preceding sentence provides that, to the extent necessary to achieve the Per Unit Capital Amount balances described above, items of income and gain that would otherwise be included in Net Income or Net Loss, as the case may be, for the taxable period in which the Liquidation Date occurs, shall be reallocated from the Unitholders holding Limited Partner Units other than Series A Preferred Units to Unitholders 
  
   81 

holding Series A Preferred Units. In the event that (i) the Liquidation Date occurs on or before the date (not including any extension of time) prescribed by law for the filing of the Partnership s federal income tax return for the taxable period immediately prior to the taxable period in which the Liquidation Date occurs and (ii) the reallocation of items for the taxable period in which the Liquidation Date occurs as set forth above in this   Section 6.1(d)(xi)(C)   fails to achieve the Per Unit Capital Amounts described above, then items of income, gain, loss and deduction for such prior taxable period shall be reallocated among all Partners in a manner that will, to the maximum extent possible and after taking into account all other allocations made pursuant to this   Section 6.1(d)(xi)(C)  , cause the Per Unit Capital Amount in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit to equal the Series A Liquidation Value. 
  (xii)        Curative Allocation  . 
  (A)        Notwithstanding any other provision of this   Section 6.1  , other than the Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken into account in making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together, shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been allocated to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in this   Section 6.1  . Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Required Allocations relating to (1) Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain and (2) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. In exercising its discretion under this   Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A)  , the General Partner may take into account future Required Allocations that, although not yet made, are likely to offset other Required Allocations previously made. Allocations pursuant to this   Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A)   shall only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the General Partner determines that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners. Further, allocations pursuant to this   Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A)   shall be deferred with respect to allocations pursuant to   clauses (1)   and   (2)   hereof to the extent the General Partner determines that such allocations are likely to be offset by subsequent Required Allocations. 
  (B)        The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply the provisions of   Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A)   in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to   Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A)   among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions. 
  (xiii)        Corrective and Other Allocations  .  In the event of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items or any Book-Down Event or any recognition of a Net Termination Loss, the following rules shall apply: 
  (A)        Except as provided in   Section 6.1(d)(xiii)(B)  , in the case of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items (other than an allocation of Unrealized  
  
   82 

Gain or Unrealized Loss under   Section 5.5(d)   hereof), the General Partner shall allocate such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items to (1) the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights and the General Partner to the same extent that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items was allocated to them pursuant to   Section 5.5(d)   and (2) all Unitholders, Pro Rata, to the extent that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items was allocated to any Unitholders pursuant to   Section 5.5(d)  . 
  (B)        In the case of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items (other than an allocation of Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss under   Section 5.5(d)   hereof or an allocation of Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss pursuant to   Section 6.1(c)   hereof) as a result of a sale or other taxable disposition of any Partnership asset that is an Adjusted Property (   Disposed of Adjusted Property   ), the General Partner shall allocate (1) additional items of gross income and gain (aa) away from the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights and (bb) to the Unitholders, or (2) additional items of deduction and loss (aa) away from the Unitholders and (bb) to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights, to the extent that the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items allocated to the Unitholders exceed their Share of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items with respect to such Disposed of Adjusted Property. Any allocation made pursuant to this   Section 6.1(d)(xiii)(B)   shall be made after all of the other Agreed Allocations have been made as if this   Section 6.1(d)(xiii)   were not in this Agreement and, to the extent necessary, shall require the reallocation of items that have been allocated pursuant to such other Agreed Allocations. 
  (C)        In the case of any negative adjustments to the Capital Accounts of the Partners resulting from a Book-Down Event or from the recognition of a Net Termination Loss, such negative adjustment (1) shall first be allocated, to the extent of the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments, in such a manner, as determined by the General Partner, that to the extent possible the aggregate Capital Accounts of the Partners will equal the amount that would have been the Capital Account balances of the Partners if no prior Book-Up Events had occurred, and (2) any negative adjustment in excess of the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments shall be allocated pursuant to   Section 6.1(c)   hereof. 
  (D)        For purposes of this   Section 6.1(d)(xiii)  , the Unitholders shall be treated as being allocated Additional Book Basis Derivative Items to the extent that such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items have reduced the amount of income that would otherwise have been allocated to the Unitholders under this Agreement. In making the allocations required under this   Section 6.1(d)(xiii)  , the General Partner may apply whatever conventions or other methodology it determines will satisfy the purpose of this   Section 6.1(d)(xiii)  . Without limiting the foregoing, if an Adjusted Property is contributed by the Partnership to another entity classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes (the    lower tier partnership   ), the General Partner may make allocations similar to those described in   Sections 6.1(d)(xiii)(A)   through   (C)   to the extent the General Partner determines such allocations are necessary to account for the Partnership s allocable share of income, gain, loss and deduction of the lower tier partnership that relate to the contributed Adjusted Property in a manner that is consistent with the purpose of this   Section 6.1(d)(xiii)  . 
  
   83 

Section 6.2        Allocations for Tax Purposes  . 
  (a)        Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of  book  income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to   Section 6.1  . 
  (b)        In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss, depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the Partners in the manner provided under Section 704(c) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, as determined to be appropriate by the General Partner (taking into account the General Partner s discretion under   Section 6.1(d)(x)(D)  );   provided  ,   however  , that the General Partner shall apply the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) in all events. 
  (c)        The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or amortization method and useful life applied to the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6) or any successor regulations thereto. If the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in the Partnership s property. If the General Partner chooses not to utilize such aggregate method, the General Partner may use any other depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests, so long as such conventions would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the Record Holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests. 
  (d)        In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1245-1(e) and 1.1250-1(f), any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this   Section 6.2  , be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as Recapture Income. 
  (e)        All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the Partnership;   provided  ,   however  , that such allocations, once made, shall be adjusted (in the manner determined by the General Partner) to take into account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code. 
  
   84 

(f)        Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction, for federal income tax purposes, shall be determined for each taxable period and prorated on a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of each month;   provided  ,   however  , that such items for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the month in which the last Option Closing Date or the expiration of the Over-Allotment Option occurs shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of the next succeeding month;   provided further  , that gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of any assets of the Partnership or any other extraordinary item of income or loss realized and recognized other than in the ordinary course of business, as determined by the General Partner, shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of the month in which such gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. The General Partner may revise, alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation to the extent permitted or required by Section 706 of the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. 
  (g)        Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the provisions of this   Article VI   shall instead be made to the beneficial owner of Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee, agent or representative in any case in which such nominee, agent or representative has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method determined by the General Partner. 
  (h)        If, as a result of the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit into Common Units and the adjustments pursuant to   Section 5.5(d)(iii)  , a Capital Account reallocation is required consistent with the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the General Partner shall make corrective allocations pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x). 
  Section 6.3        Requirement and Characterization of Distributions; Distributions to Record Holders  . 
  (a)        Subject to   Section 5.14(b)(i)  , within 60 days following the end of each Quarter commencing with the Quarter ending on December 31, 2012, an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall be distributed in accordance with this   Article VI  , by the Partnership to the Partners as of the Record Date selected by the General Partner. The Record Date for the first distribution of Available Cash shall not be prior to the final closing of the Over-Allotment Option. All amounts of Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on any date from any source shall be deemed to be Operating Surplus until the sum of all amounts of Available Cash theretofore distributed by the Partnership to the Partners pursuant to   Section 6.4   equals the Operating Surplus from the Closing Date through the close of the immediately preceding Quarter. Any remaining amounts of Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on such date shall, except as otherwise provided in   Section 6.5  , be deemed to be  Capital Surplus.  All distributions required to be made under this Agreement shall be made  
  
   85 

subject to Sections 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act and other applicable law, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement. 
  (b)        Notwithstanding   Section 6.3(a)   (but subject to the last sentence of   Section 6.3(a)  ), in the event of the dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership, all cash received during or after the Quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs shall be applied and distributed solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of,   Section 12.4  . 
  (c)        Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by the Partnership, directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full payment and satisfaction of the Partnership s liability in respect of such payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an interest in such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise. 
  Section 6.4        Distributions of Available Cash from Operating Surplus  . 
  (a)        Available Cash with respect to any Quarter that is deemed to be Operating Surplus pursuant to the provisions of   Section 6.3   or   Section 6.5   shall be distributed as follows, except as otherwise required by   Section 5.14(b)(i)   or in respect of additional Partnership Interests issued pursuant to   Section 5.6(b)  : 
  (i)        First, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage Interest and (B) to the holders of Common Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner s Percentage Interest in   subclause (A)  , until there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then outstanding an amount equal to the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for such Quarter; 
  (ii)        Second, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage Interest and (B) to the holders of Common Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner s Percentage Interest in   subclause (A)  , until there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then outstanding an amount equal to the excess of the First Target Distribution over the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for such Quarter; 
  (iii)        Third, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage Interest, (B) 13% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata, and (C) to the holders of Common Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of the percentages applicable to   subclauses (A)   and   (B)   of this   clause (iii)  , until there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then outstanding an amount equal to the excess of the Second Target Distribution over the First Target Distribution for such Quarter; 
  (iv)        Fourth, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage Interest, (B) 23% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata, and (C) to the holders of Common Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of the percentages applicable to   subclauses (A)   and   (B)   of this   clause (iv)  , until there has been  
  
   86 

distributed in respect of each Common Unit then outstanding an amount equal to the excess of the Third Target Distribution over the Second Target Distribution for such Quarter; and 
  (v)        Thereafter, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage Interest, (B) 48% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata, and (C) to holders of Common Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of the percentages applicable to   subclauses (A)   and   (B)   of this   clause (v)  ;  
  provided  ,   however  , that if the Minimum Quarterly Distribution, the First Target Distribution, the Second Target Distribution and the Third Target Distribution have been reduced to zero pursuant to the second sentence of   Section 6.6(a)  , the distribution of Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating Surplus with respect to any Quarter will be made solely in accordance with   Section 6.4(a)(v)  . 
  Section 6.5        Distributions of Available Cash from Capital Surplus  .  Available Cash that is deemed to be Capital Surplus pursuant to the provisions of   Section 6.3(a)   shall be distributed, unless the provisions of   Section 6.3   require otherwise, to the General Partner and the holders of Common Units, Pro Rata, until a hypothetical holder of a Common Unit acquired on the Closing Date has received with respect to such Common Unit distributions of Available Cash that are deemed to be Capital Surplus in an aggregate amount equal to the Initial Unit Price. Thereafter, all Available Cash shall be distributed as if it were Operating Surplus and shall be distributed in accordance with   Section 6.4  . 
  Section 6.6        Adjustment of Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distribution Levels  . 
  (a)        The Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distributions shall be proportionately adjusted in the event of any distribution, combination or subdivision (whether effected by a distribution payable in Limited Partner Units or otherwise) of Limited Partner Units or other Partnership Interests in accordance with   Section 5.9  . In the event of a distribution of Available Cash that is deemed to be from Capital Surplus, the then applicable Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distributions shall be adjusted proportionately downward to equal the product obtained by multiplying the otherwise applicable Minimum Quarterly Distribution, First Target Distribution, Second Target Distribution and Third Target Distribution, as the case may be, by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Unrecovered Initial Unit Price of the Common Units immediately after giving effect to such distribution and the denominator of which is the Unrecovered Initial Unit Price of the Common Units immediately prior to giving effect to such distribution. 
  (b)        The Minimum Quarterly Distribution, First Target Distribution, Second Target Distribution and Third Target Distribution, shall also be subject to adjustment pursuant to   Section 5.11   and   Section 6.9  . 
  
   87 

Section 6.7        [Reserved  .] 
  Section 6.8        Special Provisions Relating to the Holders of Incentive Distribution Rights  . 
  (a)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights (1) shall (x) possess the rights and obligations provided in this Agreement with respect to a Limited Partner pursuant to   Article III   and   Article VII   and (y) have a Capital Account as a Partner pursuant to   Section 5.5   and all other provisions related thereto and (2) shall not (x) be entitled to vote on any matters requiring the approval or vote of the holders of Voting Eligible Limited Partner Units, except as provided by law, (y) be entitled to any distributions other than as provided in   Sections 6.4(a)(iii)  ,   (iv)   and   (v)  , and   Section 12.4   or (z) be allocated items of income, gain, loss or deduction other than as specified in this   Article VI  ;   provided  ,   however  , that for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not preclude the Partnership from making any other payments or distributions in connection with other actions permitted by this Agreement. 
  (b)        A Unitholder shall not be permitted to transfer an IDR Reset Common Unit (other than a transfer to an Affiliate) if the remaining balance in the transferring Unitholder s Capital Account with respect to the retained IDR Reset Common Units would be negative after giving effect to the allocation under   Section 5.5(c)(iii)  . 
  (c)        A holder of an IDR Reset Common Unit that was issued in connection with an IDR Reset Election pursuant to   Section 5.11   shall not be issued a Common Unit Certificate pursuant to   Section 4.1   (if the Common Units are evidenced by Certificates) or evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Common Units, and shall not be permitted to transfer such Common Unit to a Person that is not an Affiliate of such holder, until such time as the General Partner determines, based on advice of counsel, that each such IDR Reset Common Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics, in all material respects, to the intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit. In connection with the condition imposed by this   Section 6.8(c)  , the General Partner may take whatever steps are required to provide economic uniformity to such IDR Reset Common Units in preparation for a transfer of such IDR Reset Common Units, including the application of   Section 5.5(c)(iii)  ,   Section 6.1(d)(x)(B)  , or   Section 6.1(d)(x)(C)  ;   provided  ,   however  , that no such steps may be taken that would have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units. 
  Section 6.9        Entity-Level Taxation  .  If legislation is enacted or the official interpretation of existing legislation is modified by a governmental authority, which after giving effect to such enactment or modification, results in a Group Member becoming subject to federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or withholding taxes in excess of the amount of such taxes due from the Group Member prior to such enactment or modification (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the rate of such taxation applicable to the Group Member), then the General Partner may, at its option, reduce the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and the Target Distributions by the amount of income or withholding taxes that are payable by reason of any such new legislation or interpretation (the    Incremental Income Taxes   ), or any portion  
  
   88 

thereof selected by the General Partner, in the manner provided in this   Section 6.9  . If the General Partner elects to reduce the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and the Target Distributions for any Quarter with respect to all or a portion of any Incremental Income Taxes, the General Partner shall estimate for such Quarter the Partnership Group s aggregate liability (the    Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount   ) for all (or the relevant portion of) such Incremental Income Taxes;   provided   that any difference between such estimate and the actual liability for Incremental Income Taxes (or the relevant portion thereof) for such Quarter may, to the extent determined by the General Partner, be taken into account in determining the Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount with respect to each Quarter in which any such difference can be determined. For each such Quarter, the Minimum Quarterly Distribution, First Target Distribution, Second Target Distribution and Third Target Distribution, shall be the product obtained by multiplying (a) the amounts therefor that are set out herein prior to the application of this   Section 6.9   times (b) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) Available Cash with respect to such Quarter by (ii) the sum of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter and the Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount for such Quarter, as determined by the General Partner. For purposes of the foregoing, Available Cash with respect to a Quarter will be deemed reduced by the Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount for that Quarter. 
  Section 6.10        Special Provisions Relating to the Holders of Converted Units  . 
  (a)        A Unitholder holding a Converted Common Unit shall not be issued a Common Unit pursuant to   Section 4.1  , and shall not be permitted to transfer such Converted Common Units to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the holder (subject to the other transfer restrictions set forth in this Agreement) until such time as the General Partner reasonably determines that, upon transfer, each such Converted Common Unit would have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and U.S. federal income tax characteristics to the transferee, in all material respects, to the intrinsic economic and U.S. federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit to such transferee. In connection with the condition imposed by this   Section 6.10  , the General Partner shall take whatever steps are required to provide economic uniformity to the Converted Common Units in preparation for a transfer of such Converted Common Units, including the application of   Section 5.5(c)(iv)   and   Section 6.1(d)(x)  ;   provided  ,   however  , that no such steps may be taken that would have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Converted Common Units (for this purpose the allocations of items of income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to Common Units or Class B Units will be deemed not to have a material adverse effect on the Common Units). 
  (b)        A holder of a Converted Common Unit or a Class B Unit shall be required to provide notice to the General Partner of any transfer, disposition, or other  sale or exchange  (within the meaning of Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code) of any of its Converted Common Units or Class B Units within 45 days of such event, or by the last Business Day of the calendar year in which such event occurs, if shorter, providing the number of Converted Common Units or Class B Units that were transferred, disposed of or subject to the sale or exchange.

To the extent the General Partner determines such action to be necessary or appropriate, the General Partner shall file amendments to and restatements of the Certificate of Limited Partnership and do all things to maintain the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership or other entity in which the limited partners have limited liability) under the laws of the State of Delaware or of any other state in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own property.

Reimbursements pursuant to this   Section 7.4   shall be in addition to any reimbursement to the General Partner as a result of indemnification pursuant to   Section 7.7  . Any allocation of expenses to the Partnership by the General Partner in a manner consistent with its or its Affiliates  past business practices and, in the case of assets regulated by FERC, then applicable accounting and allocation methodologies generally permitted by FERC for rate-making purposes (or in the absence of then-applicable methodologies permitted by FERC, consistent with the most-recently applicable methodologies), shall be deemed to have been made in good faith. 
  (c)        The General Partner, without the approval of the Limited Partners (who shall have no right to vote in respect thereof), may propose and adopt on behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans, employee programs and employee practices (including plans, programs and practices involving the issuance of Partnership Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests), or cause the Partnership to issue Partnership Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests in connection with, or pursuant to, any employee benefit plan, employee program or employee practice maintained or sponsored by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates in each case for the benefit of officers, employees and directors of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, in respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the Partnership Group. The Partnership agrees to issue and sell to the General Partner or any of its Affiliates any Partnership Interests that the General Partner or such Affiliates are obligated to provide to any officers, employees, consultants and directors pursuant to any such employee benefit plans, employee programs or employee practices. Expenses incurred by the General Partner in connection with any such plans, programs and practices (including the net cost to the General Partner or such Affiliates of Partnership Interests purchased by the General Partner or such Affiliates from the Partnership to fulfill options or awards under such plans, programs and practices) shall be reimbursed in accordance with   Section 7.4(b)  . Any and all obligations of the General Partner under any employee benefit plans, employee programs or employee practices adopted by the General Partner as permitted by this   Section 7.4(c)   shall constitute obligations of the General Partner hereunder and shall be assumed by any successor General Partner approved

  (d)        The General Partner and its Affiliates may charge any member of the Partnership Group a management fee to the extent necessary to allow the Partnership Group to reduce the amount of any state franchise or income tax or any tax based upon the revenues or gross margin of any member of the Partnership Group if the tax benefit produced by the payment of such management fee or fees exceeds the amount of such fee or fees. 
  (e)        The General Partner and its Affiliates may enter into an agreement to provide services to any Group Member for a fee or otherwise than for cost. 
  Section 7.5        Outside Activities  .

None of any Group Member, any Limited Partner or any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, or the partnership relationship established hereby in any business ventures of any Unrestricted Person. 
  (c)        Subject to the terms of   Section 7.5(a)   and   Section 7.5(b)  , but otherwise notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the engaging in competitive activities by any Unrestricted Person (other than the General Partner) in accordance with the provisions of this   Section 7.5   is hereby approved by the Partnership and all Partners, (ii) it shall be deemed not to be a breach of any duty or any other obligation of any type whatsoever of the General Partner or any other Unrestricted Person for the Unrestricted Persons (other than the General Partner) to engage in such business interests and activities in preference to or to the  
  
   94 

exclusion of the Partnership and (iii) the Unrestricted Persons shall have no obligation hereunder or as a result of any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise, to present business opportunities to the Partnership. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law or in equity, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, shall not apply to any Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner). No Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Partnership, shall have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the Partnership, and such Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) shall not be liable to the Partnership, to any Limited Partner or any other Person bound by this Agreement for breach of any duty by reason of the fact that such Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) pursues or acquires for itself, directs such opportunity to another Person or does not communicate such opportunity or information to the Partnership,   provided   that such Unrestricted Person does not engage in such business or activity using confidential or proprietary information provided by or on behalf of the Partnership to such Unrestricted Person. 
  (d)        The General Partner and each of its Affiliates may acquire Limited Partner Units or other Partnership Interests in addition to those acquired on the Closing Date and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be entitled to exercise, at their option, all rights relating to all Limited Partner Units and/or other Partnership Interests acquired by them. The term  Affiliates  when used in this   Section 7.5(d)   with respect to the General Partner shall not include any Group Member. 
  Section 7.6        Loans from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from the Partnership or Group Members  . 
  (a)        The General Partner or any of its Affiliates may lend to any Group Member, and any Group Member may borrow from the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, funds needed or desired by the Group Member for such periods of time and in such amounts as the General Partner may determine;   provided  ,   however  , that in any such case the lending party may not charge the borrowing party interest at a rate greater than the rate that would be charged the borrowing party or impose terms less favorable to the borrowing party than would be charged or imposed on the borrowing party by unrelated lenders on comparable loans made on an arm s-length basis (without reference to the lending party s financial abilities or guarantees), all as determined by the General Partner. The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any costs (other than any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party in connection with the borrowing of such funds.

   95 

(c)        No borrowing by any Group Member or the approval thereof by the General Partner shall be deemed to constitute a breach of any duty, expressed or implied, of the General Partner or its Affiliates to the Partnership or the Limited Partners existing hereunder, or existing at law, in equity or otherwise by reason of the fact that the purpose or effect of such borrowing is directly or indirectly to enable distributions to the General Partner or its Affiliates (including in their capacities as Limited Partners) to exceed the General Partner s Percentage Interest of the total amount distributed to all Partners. 
  Section 7.7        Indemnification  . 
  (a)        To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts arising from any and all threatened, pending or completed claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal and including appeals, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee and acting (or refraining to act) in such capacity on behalf of or for the benefit of the Partnership;   provided  , that the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless pursuant to this Agreement if there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in intentional fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee s conduct was unlawful;   provided  ,   further  , no indemnification pursuant to this   Section 7.7   shall be available to any Affiliate of the General Partner (other than a Group Member), or to any other Indemnitee, with respect to any such Affiliate s obligations pursuant to the Transaction Documents. Any indemnification pursuant to this   Section 7.7   shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the General Partner shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification. 
  (b)        To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to   Section 7.7(a)   in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this   Section 7.7  , the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Partnership of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized by this   Section 7.7  . 
  (c)        The indemnification provided by this   Section 7.7   shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of Voting Eligible Limited Partner Interests, as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee s capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in  
  
   96 

any other capacity (including any capacity under the IPO Underwriting Agreement), and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee. 
  (d)        The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against, or expense that may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the Partnership s activities or such Person s activities on behalf of the Partnership, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement. 
  (e)        For purposes of this   Section 7.7  , the Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute  fines  within the meaning of   Section 7.7(a)  ; and action taken or omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose that is in the best interests of the Partnership. 
  (f)        In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement. 
  (g)        An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this   Section 7.7   because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 
  (h)        The provisions of this   Section 7.7   are for the benefit of the Indemnitees and their heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. 
  (i)        No amendment, modification or repeal of this   Section 7.7   or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this   Section 7.7   as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted. 
  Section 7.8        Liability of Indemnitees  . 
  (a)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the Limited Partners, or any 
  
   97 

other Persons who are bound by this Agreement for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter in question, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in intentional fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee s conduct was criminal. 
  (b)        The General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by the General Partner in good faith. 
  (c)        To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other Indemnitee acting in connection with the Partnership s business or affairs shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner or to any other Persons who are bound by this Agreement for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. 
  (d)        Any amendment, modification or repeal of this   Section 7.8   or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this   Section 7.8   as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted. 
  Section 7.9        Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and Modification of Duties  . 
  (a)        Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Group Member Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Partnership, any Group Member or any Partner, on the other, any resolution or course of action by the General Partner or its Affiliates in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all Partners, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, of any Group Member Agreement, of any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest is (i) approved by Special Approval, (ii) approved by the vote of a majority of the Voting Eligible Common Units (excluding Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates) and Series A Preferred Units voting together as a single class, (iii) on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iv) fair and reasonable to the Partnership, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The General Partner shall be authorized but not required in connection with its resolution of such conflict of interest to seek Special Approval or Unitholder approval of such resolution, and the General Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received Special Approval or Unitholder approval. Whenever the General  
  
   98 

Partner makes a determination to refer any potential conflict of interest to the Conflicts Committee for Special Approval, seek Unitholder approval or adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received Special Approval or Unitholder approval, then the General Partner shall be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to make such determination or to take or decline to take such other action free of any duty or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership or any Limited Partner, and the General Partner shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard or duty imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity, and the General Partner in making such determination or taking or declining to take such other action shall be permitted to do so in its sole and absolute discretion. If Special Approval is sought, then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision, the Conflicts Committee acted in good faith, and if the Board of Directors determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in   clauses (iii)   or   (iv)   above or that a director satisfies the eligibility requirements to be a member of the Conflicts Committee, then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision, the Board of Directors acted in good faith. In any proceeding brought by any Limited Partner or by or on behalf of such Limited Partner or any other Limited Partner or the Partnership challenging any action by the Conflicts Committee with respect to any matter referred to the Conflicts Committee for Special Approval by the General Partner, any determination by the Board of Directors that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in   clauses (iii)   or   (iv)   above or any determination by the Board of Directors that a director satisfies the eligibility requirements to be a member of the Conflicts Committee, the Person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding shall have the burden of overcoming the presumption that the Conflicts Committee or the Board of Directors, as applicable, acted in good faith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law or equity, the existence of the conflicts of interest described in the IPO Registration Statement are hereby approved by all Partners and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any such duty. 
  (b)        Whenever the General Partner or the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof (including the Conflicts Committee), makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other action, or any Affiliate of the General Partner causes the General Partner to do so, in its capacity as the general partner of the Partnership as opposed to in its individual capacity, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then, unless another express standard is provided for in this Agreement, the General Partner, the Board of Directors or such committee or such Affiliates causing the General Partner to do so, shall make such determination or take or decline to take such other action in good faith and shall not be subject to any other or different standards (including fiduciary standards) imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity. A determination or other action or inaction will conclusively be deemed to be in  good faith  for all purposes of this Agreement, if the Person or Persons making such determination or taking or declining to take such other action subjectively believe that the determination or other action or inaction is not adverse to the best interests of the Partnership Group. 
  
   99 

(c)        Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as the general partner of the Partnership, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the General Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, are entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to make such determination or to take or decline to take such other action free of any duty or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership or any Limited Partner, and the General Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity, and the Person or Persons making such determination or taking or declining to take such other action shall be permitted to do so in their sole and absolute discretion. By way of illustration and not of limitation, whenever the phrase,  the General Partner at its option,  or some variation of that phrase, is used in this Agreement, it indicates that the General Partner is acting in its individual capacity. For the avoidance of doubt, whenever the General Partner votes or transfers its Partnership Interests, or refrains from voting or transferring its Partnership Interests, it shall be acting in its individual capacity. 
  (d)        The General Partner s organizational documents may provide that determinations to take or decline to take any action in its individual, rather than representative, capacity may or shall be determined by its members, if the General Partner is a limited liability company, stockholders, if the General Partner is a corporation, or the members or stockholders of the General Partner s general partner, if the General Partner is a partnership. 
  (e)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the General Partner and its Affiliates shall have no duty or obligation, express or implied, to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of any asset of the Partnership Group other than in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and its Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time to time specifically dealing with such use. Any determination by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be at its option. 
  (f)        Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or required by the Delaware Act, neither the General Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties, to the Partnership or any Limited Partner and the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict, eliminate or otherwise modify the duties and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, of the General Partner or any other Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of the General Partner or such other Indemnitee. 
  (g)        The Unitholders hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership as a partner or member of a Group Member, to approve actions by the general partner or managing member of such Group Member similar to those actions permitted to be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this   Section 7.9  . 
  
   100 

Section 7.10        Other Matters Concerning the General Partner and Other Indemnitees  . 
  (a)        The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. 
  (b)        The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon the advice or opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as to matters that the General Partner or such Indemnitee, respectively, reasonably believes to be within such Person s professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion. 
  (c)        The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers, a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers of the Partnership or any Group Member. 
  Section 7.11        Purchase or Sale of Partnership Interests  .  The General Partner may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise acquire Partnership Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests. As long as Partnership Interests are held by any Group Member, such Partnership Interests shall not be considered outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise provided herein. The General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner may also purchase or otherwise acquire and sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership Interests for its own account, subject to the provisions of   Articles IV   and   X  . 
  Section 7.12        Registration Rights of the General Partner and its Affiliates  . 
  (a)        Demand Registration  .  Upon receipt of a Notice from any Holder at any time after the 180th day after the Closing Date, the Partnership shall file with the Commission as promptly as reasonably practicable a registration statement under the Securities Act (each, a    Registration Statement   ) providing for the resale of the Registrable Securities, which may, at the option of the Holder giving such Notice, be a Registration Statement that provides for the resale of the Registrable Securities from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Partnership shall not be required pursuant to this   Section 7.12(a)   to file more than one Registration Statement in any twelve-month period nor to file more than three Registration Statements in the aggregate. The Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the initial filing of the Registration Statement and to remain effective and available for the resale of the Registrable Securities by the Selling Holders named therein until the earlier of (i) six months following such Registration Statement s effective date and (ii) the date on which all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold. In the event one or more  
  
   101 

Holders request in a Notice to dispose of a number of Registrable Securities that such Holder or Holders reasonably anticipates will result in gross proceeds of at least $30,000,000 in the aggregate pursuant to a Registration Statement in an Underwritten Offering, the Partnership shall retain underwriters that are reasonably acceptable to such Selling Holders in order to permit such Selling Holders to effect such disposition through an Underwritten Offering;   provided  ,   however  , that the Partnership shall have the exclusive right to select the bookrunning managers. The Partnership and such Selling Holders shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form that is reasonably acceptable to the Partnership and take all reasonable actions as are requested by the managing underwriters to facilitate the Underwritten Offering and sale of Registrable Securities therein. No Holder may participate in the Underwritten Offering unless it agrees to sell its Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement on the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement and completes and delivers all necessary documents and information reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting agreement. In the event that the managing underwriter of such Underwritten Offering advises the Partnership and the Holder in writing that in its opinion the inclusion of all or some Registrable Securities would adversely and materially affect the timing or success of the Underwritten Offering, the amount of Registrable Securities that each Selling Holder requested be included in such Underwritten Offering shall be reduced on a Pro Rata basis to the aggregate amount that the managing underwriter deems will not have such material and adverse effect. Any Holder may withdraw from such Underwritten Offering by notice to the Partnership and the managing underwriter;   provided   such notice is delivered prior to the launch of such Underwritten Offering. 
  (b)        Piggyback Registration  .  At any time after the 180th day after the Closing Date, if the Partnership shall propose to file a Registration Statement (other than pursuant to a demand made pursuant to   Section 7.12(a)  ) for an offering of Partnership Interests for cash (other than an offering relating solely to an employee benefit plan, an offering relating to a transaction on Form S-4 or an offering on any registration statement that does not permit secondary sales), the Partnership shall notify all Holders of such proposal at least five business days before the proposed filing date. The Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to include such number of Registrable Securities held by any Holder in such Registration Statement as each Holder shall request in a Notice received by the Partnership within two business days of such Holder s receipt of the notice from the Partnership. If the Registration Statement about which the Partnership gives notice under this   Section 7.12(b)   is for an Underwritten Offering, then any Holder s ability to include its desired amount of Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement shall be conditioned on such Holder s inclusion of all such Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering;   provided   that, in the event that the managing underwriter of such Underwritten Offering advises the Partnership and the Holder in writing that in its opinion the inclusion of all or some Registrable Securities would adversely and materially affect the timing or success of the Underwritten Offering, the amount of Registrable Securities that each Selling Holder requested be included in such Underwritten Offering shall be reduced on a Pro Rata basis to the aggregate amount that the managing underwriter deems will not have such material and adverse effect. In connection with any such Underwritten Offering, the Partnership and the Selling Holders involved shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form that is reasonably acceptable to the Partnership and take all reasonable actions as are requested by the managing underwriters to facilitate the Underwritten Offering and sale of  
  
   102 

Registrable Securities therein. No Holder may participate in the Underwritten Offering unless it agrees to sells its Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement on the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement and completes and delivers all necessary documents and information reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting agreement. Any Holder may withdraw from such Underwritten Offering by notice to the Partnership and the managing underwriter;   provided   such notice is delivered prior to the launch of such Underwritten Offering. The Partnership shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any Registration Statement or Underwritten Offering initiated by it under this   Section 7.12(b)   prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement or the pricing date of the Underwritten Offering, as applicable.

If the General Partner is removed by the Unitholders under circumstances where Cause exists or if the General Partner withdraws under circumstances where such withdrawal violates this Agreement, and if a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of   Section 11.1   or   Section 11.2   (or if the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to   Section 12.2   and the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner), such successor shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date of the withdrawal or removal of such Departing General Partner (or, in the event the business of the Partnership is continued, prior to the date the business of the Partnership is continued), to purchase the Combined Interest for such fair market value of such Combined Interest. In either event, the Departing General Partner shall be entitled to receive all reimbursements due such Departing General Partner pursuant to   Section 7.4  , including any employee-related liabilities (including severance liabilities), incurred in connection with the termination of any employees employed by the Departing General Partner or its Affiliates (other than any Group Member) for the benefit of the Partnership or the other Group Members. 
  For purposes of this   Section 11.3(a)  , the fair market value of the Combined Interest shall be determined by agreement between the Departing General Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after the effective date of such Departing General Partner s withdrawal or removal, by an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by the Departing General Partner and its successor, which, in turn,  
  
   113 

may rely on other experts, and the determination of which shall be conclusive as to such matter. If such parties cannot agree upon one independent investment banking firm or other independent expert within 45 days after the effective date of such withdrawal or removal, then the Departing General Partner shall designate an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, the Departing General Partner s successor shall designate an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, and such firms or experts shall mutually select a third independent investment banking firm or independent expert, which third independent investment banking firm or other independent expert shall determine the fair market value of the Combined Interest. In making its determination, such third independent investment banking firm or other independent expert may consider the then current trading price of Limited Partner Units on any National Securities Exchange on which any Limited Partner Units are then listed or admitted to trading, the value of the Partnership s assets, the rights and obligations of the Departing General Partner, the value of the Incentive Distribution Rights and the General Partner Interest and other factors it may deem relevant. 
  (b)        If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in   Section 11.3(a)  , the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) shall become a Limited Partner and its Combined Interest shall be converted into Common Units pursuant to a valuation made by an investment banking firm or other independent expert selected pursuant to   Section 11.3(a)  , without reduction in such Partnership Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution by reason of the admission of its successor). Any successor General Partner shall indemnify the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) as to all debts and liabilities of the Partnership arising on or after the date on which the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) becomes a Limited Partner. For purposes of this Agreement, conversion of the Combined Interest of the Departing General Partner to Common Units will be characterized as if the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) contributed its Combined Interest to the Partnership in exchange for the newly issued Common Units. 
  (c)        If a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of   Section 11.1   or   Section 11.2   (or if the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to   Section 12.2   and the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner) and the option described in   Section 11.3(a)   is not exercised by the party entitled to do so, the successor General Partner shall, at the effective date of its admission to the Partnership, contribute to the Partnership cash in the amount equal to the product of (x) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Percentage Interest of the General Partner Interest of the Departing General Partner by (B) a percentage equal to 100% less the Percentage Interest of the General Partner Interest of the Departing General Partner and (y) the Net Agreed Value of the Partnership s assets on such date. In such event, such successor General Partner shall, subject to the following sentence, be entitled to its Percentage Interest of all Partnership allocations and distributions to which the Departing General Partner was entitled. In addition, the successor General Partner shall cause this Agreement to be amended to reflect that, from and after the date of such successor General Partner s admission, the successor General Partner s interest in all Partnership distributions and allocations shall be its Percentage Interest. 
  
   114 

Section 11.4        Conversion of General Partner Interest and Incentive Distribution Rights  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, if the General Partner is removed as general partner of the Partnership under circumstances where Cause does not exist and Limited Partner Units held by the General Partner and its Affiliates are not voted in favor of such removal, the General Partner will have the right to convert its General Partner Interest and its Incentive Distribution Rights into Common Units or to receive cash in exchange therefor in accordance with   Section 11.3  . 
  Section 11.5        Withdrawal of Limited Partners  .  No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the Partnership;   provided  ,   however  , that when a transferee of a Limited Partner s Limited Partner Interest becomes a Record Holder of the Limited Partner Interest so transferred, such transferring Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interest so transferred. 
  ARTICLE XII

  (a)        an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in   Section 11.1(a)   (other than   Section 11.1(a)(ii)  ), unless a successor is elected and a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel is received as provided in   Section 11.1(b)   or   11.2   and such successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant to   Section 10.2  ; 
  (b)        an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General Partner that is approved by the holders of a Unit Majority;

   115 

by law, within 180 days thereafter, the holders of a Unit Majority may elect to continue the business of the Partnership on the same terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement by appointing as a successor General Partner a Person approved by the holders of a Unit Majority. Unless such an election is made within the applicable time period as set forth above, the Partnership shall conduct only activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is so made, then: 
  (i)        the Partnership shall continue without dissolution unless earlier dissolved in accordance with this   Article XII  ; 
  (ii)        if the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner, then the interest of the former General Partner shall be treated in the manner provided in   Section 11.3  ; and 
  (iii)        the successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as General Partner, effective as of the Event of Withdrawal, by agreeing in writing to be bound by this Agreement; 
  provided  ,   however  , that the right of the holders of a Unit Majority to approve a successor General Partner and to continue the business of the Partnership shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the Partnership has received an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of the right would not result in the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner under the Delaware Act and (y) neither the Partnership nor any Group Member would be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for federal income tax purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue (to the extent not already so treated or taxed). 
  Section 12.3        Liquidator  .  Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to   Section 12.2  , the General Partner shall select one or more Persons to act as Liquidator. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved by holders of at least a Unit Majority . The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days  prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of at least a Unit Majority. Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by holders of at least a Unit Majority. The right to approve a successor or substitute Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein provided. Except as expressly provided in this   Article XII  , the Liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on sale set forth in   Section 7.3  ) necessary or appropriate to carry out the duties and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during the period of time required to complete the winding up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein. 
  
   116 

Section 12.4        Liquidation  .  The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership, discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the Liquidator, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the following: 
  (a)        The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator and such Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in kind, the Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of   Section 12.4(c)   to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other Partners. The Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the Partnership s assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the Partnership s assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. The Liquidator may distribute the Partnership s assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. 
  (b)        Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of   Section 12.3  ) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution rights under   Article VI  . With respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be distributed as additional liquidation proceeds. 
  (c)        All property and all cash in excess of that required to satisfy liabilities as provided in   Section 12.4(b)   shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with, and to the extent of, the positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts, as determined after taking into account all Capital Account adjustments (including, without limitation, the allocation provided for under   Section 6.1(d)(xi)(C)  , which allocates items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction among the Partners to the maximum extent possible to provide a preference in liquidation to the Capital Account of the Series A Preferred Units over the Capital Accounts of Series A Junior Interests, but excluding adjustments made by reason of distributions pursuant to this   Section 12.4(c)  ) for the taxable period of the Partnership during which the liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution shall be made by the end of such taxable period (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such occurrence); provided that any cash or cash equivalents available for distribution under this   Section 12.4(c)   shall be distributed with respect to the Series A Preferred Units and Series A Senior Securities (up to the positive balances in the associated Capital Accounts) prior to any distribution of cash or cash equivalents with respect to the Series A Junior Securities. 
  Section 12.5        Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership  .  Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as provided in   Section 12.4   in connection with the liquidation of the Partnership, the Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the  
  
   117 

State of Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Partnership shall be taken. 
  Section 12.6        Return of Contributions  .  The General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets. 
  Section 12.7        Waiver of Partition  .  To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the Partnership property. 
  Section 12.8        Capital Account Restoration  .  No Limited Partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of the Partnership. The General Partner shall be obligated to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of its interest in the Partnership by the end of the taxable year of the Partnership during which such liquidation occurs, or, if later, within 90 days after the date of such liquidation.

Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited Partner attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove of any matters submitted for consideration or to object to the  
  
   122 

failure to submit for consideration any matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting, but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the beginning of the meeting.

The presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the Voting Eligible Limited Partner Units of the class or classes for which a meeting has been called (including Voting Eligible Limited Partner Units deemed owned by the General Partner) shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners of such class or classes unless any such action by the Limited Partners requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of such Limited Partner Units, in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with this Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding Voting Eligible Limited Partner Units that in the aggregate represent a majority of the Voting Eligible Limited Partner Units entitled to vote at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute the act of all Limited Partners, unless a different percentage or class vote is required with respect to such action under the provisions of this Agreement, in which case the act of the Limited Partners holding Voting Eligible Limited Partner Units that in the aggregate represent at least such different percentage, or the act of the Limited Partners holding the requisite percentage of the necessary class, shall be required.

  Section 13.12        Right to Vote and Related Matters  . 
  (a)        Only those Record Holders of the Voting Eligible Limited Partner Units on the Record Date set pursuant to   Section 13.6   (and also subject to the limitations contained in the definition of  Voting Eligible ) shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to matters as to which the holders of the Voting Eligible Limited Partner Units have the right to vote or to act. All references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken by, the Voting Eligible Limited Partner Units shall be deemed to be references to the votes or acts of the Record Holders of such Voting Eligible Limited Partner Units. 
  (b)        With respect to Limited Partner Units that are held for a Person s account by another Person that is the Record Holder (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), such Record Holder shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Limited Partner Units on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides otherwise, vote such Limited Partner Units in favor of, and at the direction of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume such Record Holder is so acting without further inquiry.
