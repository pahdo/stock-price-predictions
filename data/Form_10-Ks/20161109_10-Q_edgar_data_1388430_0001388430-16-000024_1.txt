(2)      Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

(a)      Accounting Policies 

Container   rental   equipment is recorded at   original   cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives and residual values of the Company s container equipment are based on historical disposal experience and the Company s expectations for future used container sale prices.   Depreciation estimates are reviewed   on a regular basis to determine whether changes have taken place that would suggest that a change in   depreciation estimates  , useful lives of its equipment or the assigned residual values, is warranted. 

After the Company conducted its regular depreciation policy review, it   concluded     that a change in   the estimated residual value for 40-foot high cube dry van containers from   $1,650   to   $1,400   per container  , effective July 1, 2016  , was appropriate  .    The change increased the Company s d  epreciation expense   by   $  3.  4   million  , decreased   net income by   $  3.2   million  , and decreased diluted earnings per share by   $  0.1  7     for   the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

Depreciation estimates were last change  d   for 40-foot high cube dry van containers (and other container types within the Company s fleet) during 2012. Since that time, disposal prices for 40-foot high cube dry van containers have declined and the Company experienced losses when selling certain of these assets during   2015 and   2016. The change in residual value estimate was made to better align residual value with expectations for future used container sale prices. 

In considering changes to residual values for the three major dry van categories,   the Company   reviewed 3-year, 5-year  , 7-year, and 11-year average disposition pricings trends. As with all estimates, particularly related to long-lived assets, current market performance may not necessarily be indicative of long-term residual values, so the Company does not adjust residual values to point-in-time prices. Rather, the Company considers the mix of data shown in the following table and uses the average over time to either confirm residual value estimates or support revisions to those estimates.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 

The sale-related unit proceeds by dry   v  an container category that we considered as of September 30, 20  1  6 are shown below: 

The Company s residual value estimates (  $1,050   for a 20-ft. dry van,   $1,300   for a 40-ft. dry van, and   $1,400   for a 40-ft. high cube dry van) are lower in each instance than the historical averages, with the exception of the 3-year average. While   the Company   exp  erience  d     losses when selling certain of these assets during 2015 and 2016  , the Company does not adjust long-term residual value estimate  s   based on short-term data points, such as current year sale results and the 3-year average shown above, as the Company does not believe they are indicative of a change in the long-term market value for these containers. The Company does regularly review this data and updates the analysis  ,   and will make further revisions to residual value estimates as and when conditions warrant. 

The largest segment of the Company s non-dry   v  an container fleet consists of 20-ft. refrigerated containers and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers.   The Company regularly reviews the residual value estimates associated with its refrigerated containers. Given the specific nature of these assets and the lower volumes of containers that are sold each year in the secondary market, there is less variability in asset pricing. Similar to the Company s dry van containers, the Company evaluates the relationship between sales prices and residual values over a long-term horizon.   When measured at September 30, 2016, sales proceeds for 20-ft. refrigerated and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers averaged   $3,180   and   $4,065  , respectively, over the prior 3-year period, and   $3,219   and   $4,111  , respectively, over the   prior   5-year period. The Company excluded 7-year and 11-year   historical averages from its analysis as it does not have a long enough history of sales for refrigerated containers. The current residual values for 20-ft. refrigerated and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers are set at   $2,750   and   $3,500  , respectively. Based on the data trends, the Company believes that the residual value estimates for its refrigerated containers are appropriate and do not warrant revision. 

The Company continuously monitors disposal prices across its entire portfolio for indications of a deeper, more sustained market downturn. If necessary, the Company will adjust its estimates if there are indicators that the current weak market for containers will be sustained over a longer time horizon. 

There were no   other   changes to the Company s accounting policies during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016  . See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5  , filed with the SEC on   March   3  , 2016  , for a description of the Company s significant accounting policies  .    

(b)      Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the Financial Account  in  g Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   (ASU No. 2014-09). This new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate  s   industry-specific guidance. Leasing revenue recognition is specifically excluded from this ASU, and therefore, the new standard will only apply to   management fee revenue,   sales of equipment portfolios  ,     sales   of used equipment   and the provision of logistics services  . The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 201  7  , with early a  doption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016  .     A  doption   of the guidance   is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements  .   

In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendment to the Consolidation Analysis   (ASU No. 2015-02). The new guidance changes (1) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), (2) the variable interest entity (VIE) characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-02 effective January 1, 2016, and adoption had no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   (ASU No. 2015-03)  .    The new guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.     The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 effective January 1, 2016.   Adoption of the guidance resulted in the reclassification of unamortized debt issuance costs of   $12.  7   million and   $13.0   million as of   September   30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, from prepaid expenses and other current assets to a reduction of debt on   the Company s   consolidated balance sheets.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   (ASU No. 2015-17). The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance may   be   applied either prospectively, for all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively. The Company early adopted ASU No. 2015-07 effective December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted, and adoption did not have an impact on the Company s   consolidated financial statements  . 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases   (ASU No. 2016-02). The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new guidance will require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases, with the exception of leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease. Lessor accounting will remain similar to the current model. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU No. 2016-09), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted.   The Company is   currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flow (Topic 230)   (ASU No. 2016-15). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, and proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, among others. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period, and must be applied using a retrospective transition method.   Adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

(3)    Insurance Receivable and Impairment 

In August 2016,   Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd.   filed for court protection from its creditors. Based on prior experience, the Company believes   that   most of   its   containers will be recovered.   The Company maintains insurance to cover the value of containers that are unlikely   to be recovered   from its customers, the cost to recover containers and up to   180   days   of lost lease rental income. Accordingly, during the   three months   ended September   30,   2016, an impairment   charge   was recorded to write off   containers   with   a    book value of   $3.2   million  ,   which the Company does not expect to recover  .     A  n insurance receivable of   $1.4   million was recorded for   $  1.2     million of estimated proceeds for   irrecoverable   containers   and     $  0.2     million of recovery costs recorded as a reduction to   storage, handling and other     expenses  . The impairment  ,   net of estimated insurance proceeds of   $  2.0   million  ,   was recorded in   depreciation expense   in the consolidated statements of income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . In a  ddition, bad debt expense of   $2.  5   million   was recorded in the consolidated statements of income for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30,   201  6  ,   to fully reserve for the customer s outstanding accounts receivable.  

(4  )    Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities as a Non-Controlling Interest 

The Company regularly performs a review of its container fund arrangements with investors to determine whether   or not it has a variable interest in the   fund   and if the fund   is a   variable interest entity (  VIE  )  . If it is determined that the Company does not have a variable interest in the fund, further analysis is not required and the Company does not consolidate the f  und.   If it is determined that the Company does have a variable interest in the fund   and the fund is a VIE,   a    further analysis is performed to determine if the Company is a primary beneficiary of the VIE and meets both of the following criteria under ASC Topic 810: 

It has power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the   VIE   s   economic performance; and     

It has the obligation to absorb losses of the   VIE     that could be potentially significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the   VIE     that could potentially be significant to the VIE.     

If in the Company s judgment both of the above criteria are met, the VIE s financial statements are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements as required under ASC Topic 810,   Consolidation  .   

12   

Table of Contents  

CAI INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 

The Company currently enters into   two   types of container fund arrangements with investors which are reviewed under ASC Topic 810,   Consolidation  . These arrangements include container funds that the Company manages for investors and container funds that have entered into financing arrangements with investors  . Several of the funds that the Company manages and funds under financing arrangements are Japanese container funds that were established under separate investment agreements allowed under Japan  ese commercial laws (see Note 14  ).   Each of the funds is financed by unrelated Japanese third party investors. 

Managed Container Funds 

The fees earned   by the Company   for arranging, managing and establishing   container   funds are   commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services, and are at or above the same level of seniority as other operating liabilities of the funds that are   incurred   in the normal course of business. As such,   the Company does not have a variable interest in the   managed containers   funds  , and does   not consolidate   those   funds. The Company recognizes gain on sale of containers to the unconsolidated   funds   as sales in the ordinary course of business.   No   container portfolios were sold to the Japanese funds in the   three   and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and   2015.  

Collateralized Financing Obligations 

As of   September   30, 2016  , the Company has transferred containers  ,   with a total net book value o  f    $  1  91.8   million at the time of transfer  ,   to Japanese investor funds while concurrently entering into lease agreements for the same containers, un  der which the Company leases the containers back from the Japanese investors. In accordance with ASC Topic 840,   Sale-Leaseback Transactions,   the Company concluded these were financing transactions under which sale-leaseback accounting was not applicable. 

The terms of the transactions   with container funds under financing arrangements   include options for the Company to purchase the containers from the funds at a fixed price. As a result of the residual interest resulting from the fixed price call option, the Company concluded that it may absorb a significant amount of the variability associated with the funds  anticipated economic performance and, as a result, the Company has a variable interest in the funds.   The funds are considered VIEs under ASC Topic 810,   Consolidation  ,   because, as lessee of the funds, the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact each entity s economic performance  ,   including the leasing and managing of containers owned by the funds. As the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs and the variable interest provides the Company with the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the funds, the Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and included the VIEs  assets and liabilities as of   September   30, 2016  ,   and December 31, 201  5  , and the results of the VIEs  operations and cash flows for the three   and   nine     months ended   September   30, 2016   and   2015  ,   in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

The containers that were transferred to the Japanese investor fund  s had a net book value of   $  69.6   million as of   September   30, 2016  .

At the inception of the lease, the Company records the total minimum lease payments, executory costs, if any, and unguaranteed residual value as gross finance lease receivables. The gross finance lease receivables are reduced as customer payments are received.  There was   no   unguaranteed residual value at   September   30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5   included in gross finance lease receivables.

The difference between the gross finance lease receivables and the cost of the equipment or carrying amount at   the   lease inception is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income, together with initial direct costs, are amortized to income over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return. There were   no   unamortized initial direct costs as of   September   30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  .     

In order to estimate the allowance for losses contained in gross finance lease receivables, the Company reviews the credit worthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis. The review includes monitoring credit quality indicators, the aging of customer receivables and general economic conditions. 

The categories of gross finance lease receivables based on the Company's internal customer credit ratings can be described as follows: 

Tier 1    These customers are typically large international shipping lines that have been in business for many years and have world-class operating capabilities and significant financial resources. In most cases, the Company has had a long commercial relationship with these customers and currently maintains regular communication with them at several levels of management, which provides the Company with insight into the customer's current operating and financial performance. In the Company's view, these customers have the greatest ability to withstand cyclical down turns and would likely have greater access to needed capital than lower-rated customers. The Company views the risk of default for Tier 1 customers to range from minimal to moderate. 

Tier 2    These customers are typically either smaller shipping lines or freight forwarders with less operating scale or with a high degree of financial leverage, and accordingly the Company views these customers as subject to higher volatility in financial performance over the business cycle. The Company generally expects these customers to have less access to capital markets or other sources of financing during cyclical down turns. The Company views the risk of default for Tier 2 customers as moderate. 

Tier 3    Customers in this category exhibit volatility in payments on a regular basis. 

Based on the above categories, the Company's gross finance lease receivables were as follows (in thousands):

The fair value of stock options granted to the Company s employees and independent directors was estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions: 

The expected option term is calculated using the simplified method in accordance with SEC guidance. The expected volatility was derived from the average volatility of the Company s stock over a period approximating the expected term of the options. The risk-free rate is based on the daily U.S. Treasury yield curve with a term approximating the expected term of the options. No forfeiture rate was estimated on all options granted during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015  ,   as management believes that none of the grantees will leave the Company within the option vesting period.

The consolidated income tax expense for the three   and   nine     months ended   September   30, 2016   and 201  5  ,   was determined based upon estimates of the Company s consolidated effective income tax rates for the years ending December 31, 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively. The difference between the consolidated effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate is primarily attributable to foreign income taxes, state income taxes and the effect of certain permanent differences. 

The Company s estimated full year effective tax rate, before certain non-recurring discrete items, wa  s    3  7.1  %    a  t    September   30, 2016  , compared to   8.  8  %   at   September   30, 2015  . The   higher   estimated full year effective tax rate at   September   30, 2016   was due   to t  he increase in the proportion of   the   railcar fleet   s pretax income,   combined with a decrease of pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions   that   has led to a corresponding increase in the proportion of pretax income generated in higher tax jurisdictions.     Income tax expense   was also impacted by the Company s determination that foreign tax credits arising from the sale of a subsidiary could not be utilized, resulting in a non-cash tax charge of $1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions based on an evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. This evaluation is based on all available evidence and assumes that the appropriate tax authorities have full knowledge of all relevant information concerning the tax position. Once it has been determined that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on its technical merits, the tax benefit recognized is based on the largest amount that is grea  ter than   50%   likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of   September   30, 2016  , the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of   $0.2   million, which if recognized, would reduce the Company s effective tax rate. Total accrued interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits was less than   $0.1   mi  llion as of   September   30, 2016  . The Company does not believe the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of   September   30, 2016   will change for th  e remainder of 201  6  .   

(12  )    Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

T  he carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The Company s   senior secured notes of   $71.1   million, asset-backed notes of   $252.9   million, and   collateralized financing obligations of   $  91.6   million as of   September   30, 2016 were estimated to have a fair value of approximately   $72.3   million,   $244.7   million, and   $  90  .5   million  , respectively,   based on the fair value of estimated future payments calculated using prevailing interest rates. The fair value of these financial instruments would be categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Management believes that the balances of the Company s revolving credit facilities of   $  7  11  .0   million, term loans totaling   $  323  .3   million,   term loans held by VIE of   $  5.8   million, net inves  tment in direct finance leases of   $10  0.8   and liabilities relating to the expected future payments for   its acquisitions   (see Note   5  ) of   $  5  .0   million approximate their fair values as of   September   30, 201  6  . The fair value of these financial instruments would be categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

(13)    Commitments and Contingencies    

In addition to its debt obligations described in Note 9 above, the Company had commitments to purchase approximately $204.  7   million of rental equipment as of   September   30, 2016; $159.2 million in the twelve months ending   September   30, 2017, $32.1 million in the twelve months ending   September   30, 2018, and $13.4 million in the twelve months ending   September   30, 2019. The Company also utilizes certain office facilities and equipment under long-term non-cancellable operating lease agreements with total future minimum lease payments of approximately $2.3 million as of   September   30, 2016. 

On   October 21, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to   its m  ulti-  y  ear   r  ail   c  ar   o  rder dated June 2  9, 2015, by which it modified the types of railcars yet to be delivered as of the effective date of the amendment, reduced the overall baseline pricing and revised the amounts and delivery dates for various car types. These changes are estimated to reduce the commitments noted above by approximately $10.0 million.    

(  14  )      Related Party Transactions 

The Company transferred legal ownership of certain containers to Japanese container funds   that   were established by Japan Investment Adviser Co., Ltd. (JIA) and CAIJ  , Inc. (CAIJ)  .    Prior to April 2016,   CAIJ   was   an   80%  -owned subsidiary of CAI with the remaining   20%   owned by JIA  .    Prior to the transfer of containers from the Company, the container funds received contributions from unrelated Japanese investors, under separate Japanese investment agreements allowed under Japanese commercial laws. The contributions were used to purchase container equipment from the Company. Under the terms of the agreements, the CAI-related Japanese entities manage the activities of certain Japanese entities but may outsource the whole or part of each operation to a third party. Pursuant to its services agreements with investors, the Japanese container funds outsourced the general management of their operations to CAIJ. The Japanese container funds also entered into equipment management service agreements and financing arrangements whereby the Company manage  d    the leasing activity of containers owned by the Japanese container funds. 

As described in Note   4  , the Japanese managed container funds and financing arrangements are considered VIEs. However, with the exception of the financing arrangements described in Note 3, the Company does not consider its interest in the managed Japanese container funds to be a variable interest. As such, the Company did not consolidate the assets and liabilities, results of operations or cash flows of these funds in its consolidated financial statements.   

As described in Note   4  , the Company has included in its consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of the financing arrangements, in accordance with ASC   Topic   810,   Consolidation  .    

(15  )    Segment and Geographic Information 

The Company organizes itself by the nature of the services it provides which includes equipment leasing, equipment management and logistics.  

The container leasing segment is aggregated with equipment management and   derives its revenue from the ownership and leasing of   containers and fees earned for   managing   container   portfolios on behalf of third party investors  . The rail leasing segment derives its revenue from the ownership and leasing of railcars. The   logistics segment derives its revenue from   the   provision of logistics services.   There are   no   inter-segment revenues. 

With the exception of administrative expenses, operating expenses are directly attributable to each segment. Administrative expenses that are not directly attributable to a segment are allocated to container or rail leasing based on the net book value of equipment in each segment. 

The following tables show condensed segment information for the three   and nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   and 201  5  , reconciled to the Company s net income before income taxes and non-controlling interest as shown in its consolidated statements of income   for such periods   (in thousands):

(  16  )    Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock; however, potential common equivalent shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. 

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of basic and diluted net income per share for the three   and   nine     months ended   September   30, 2016   and 201  5   (in thousands, except per share data): 

The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended   September   30, 2016   and 201  5  ,   excluded from the denominat  or   1,  231,455     and   972,992   shares, respectively, of common stock options because their effect   would have been anti-dilutive.   The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   nine   months ended   September     30, 2016 and 2015  ,   excluded from the denominator   1,  103,495     and     670,8  50   shares, respectively, of common stock option because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

We are one of the world s leading   transportation finance and logistics   companies  . We purchase equipment,   primarily intermodal shipping containers and railcars,   which we lease to   our customers  . We also manage equipment for third  -  party investors. In operating our fleet, we lease, re-lease and dispose of equipment and contract for the repair, repositioning and storage of equipment.   We also provide domestic and international logistics services.  

In     July 2015  ,    we   purchased ClearPointt Logistics LLC   (ClearPointt)  , a  n   intermodal logistics company focused on the domestic intermodal market, for approximately   $4.1   million.   ClearPointt   is headquartered in Everett, Washington. 

In February 2016, we purchased   Challenger Overseas LLC (  Challenger  )  , a   Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (  NVOCC  ),   for approximately $10.8 million.   Challenger is headquartered in Eatontown, New Jersey. 

In June 2016, we purchased Hybrid Logistics, Inc. and its affiliate, General Transportation Services, Inc. (  collectively, Hybrid  ), asset light truck brokers, for approximately $1  2.0   million.   Hybrid   headquartered in Portland, Oregon. 

The following table  s   show the composition of our fleet as of   September   30, 2016   and 201  5   and our average utilization for the three   and   nine   months ended   September     30, 2016   and   2015: 

The intermodal marine container industry-standard measurement unit is the 20-foot equivalent unit, or TEU, which compares the size of a container to a standard 20-foot container. For example, a 20-foot container is equivalent to one TEU and a 40-foot container is equivalent to two TEUs. Containers can also be measured in cost equivalent units (CEUs), whereby the cost of each type of container is expressed as a ratio relative to the cost of a standard 20-foot dry van container. For example, the CEU ratio for a standard 40-foot dry van container is 1.6 and a 40-foot high cube container is 1.7. Utilization of containers is computed by dividing   the average   total units on lease   during the period   in CEUs, by the total CEUs in our container fleet  .   Utilization of railcars is computed by dividing the   average   number of railcars on lease   during the period   by the total number of railcars in our fleet. In both cases, the total fleet excludes new units not yet leased and off-hire units designated for sale.

On August 31, 2016, Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd. (Hanjin), the world s 7  th   largest container shipping line, announced that it had filed for court protection in South Korea from its creditors. A receiver was appointed on September 1, 2016. 

At the time of default, we had approximately 15,000 owned containers on lease to Hanjin representing $40 million of equipment exposure based on net book value, or approximately 2% of our rental revenue assets. We maintain insolvency insurance that covers the value of unreturned containers, damage to recovered containers, recovery costs, legal expenses, and the loss of post-bankruptcy income for a period from the default date to the earlier of the return of the equipment or six months. 

Our insolvency insurance has a $2.0 million deductible. Based on the level of exposure to Hanjin and recovery expectations,  we expect our insurance policy limits will be adequate to cover any potential losses in excess of the $2.0 million deductible. The losses related to the deductible were expensed during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and additional expenses are expected to be offset by the insurance policy.   Since the default, we have recovered, or cleared for redelivery, approximately 44% of containers on lease to Hanjin and expect the vast majority of the containers to be recovered. The container  s   on lease to Hanjin were manufactured for us, and are in our color, with our logo and marking, which should assist with recovery and re-leasing efforts. 

Thre  e Months Ended   September   30  , 2016     Compared to Three Months Ended   September   30  , 2015    

The following table   summarizes our operating results for the three months ended   September   30, 2016   and 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Total revenue for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016   increased $  12.  4   million, or   19  %, compared to the three months ended   September   30  , 2015  , due to a $  2.5   million, or   49  %, increase in   rail lease income   and     a    $  1  5.8   million  , or 292%,   increase in logistics revenue  , partially offset by   a $  5.5   million, or   10  %, decrease in   container lease income   and a $0.4 million, or 49%  ,   decrease in management fee revenue  . Operating expenses for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016   increased $  2  8  .2   million, or   6  6  %, compared to the three months ended   September   30  , 2015  , as a result of a $  7.2   million, or   32  %, increase in depreciation expense, a $  0.7   million, or   8  %  ,     in  crease in storage, handling and other expenses,   a $  1  3.2   million  , or 275%,    increase in logistics   transportation costs  , a $  3.  4   million, or   4  ,  715  %,   increase   in   loss   on sale of used rental equipment   and a $  3  .8   million, or   51  %, increase in administrative expenses.   Total o  ther   expense  s  , primarily net interest expense,   for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016     in  creased $  2.0   million, or   22  %, compared with the same three-month period in 201  5  . The increase in revenue was offset by the increase in operating expenses, and resulted in a  n    $  18.  4     million, or   14  2  %, decrease in net income attributable to CAI common stockholders for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016   compared to the same three-month period in 201  5  . 

Revenue.   The following discussion explains the significant changes in the composition of our total revenue for the three months ended   September   30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September     30, 2015  : 

Container Lease Income  .     Container lease income     de  creased $  5.5   million, or   10  %, to $  49.2   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016  , from $  5  4.7   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2015  .    While the average number of CEUs of   on  -  lease   owned containers remained relatively consistent between the two periods, there was a decrease of $4.  2   million   in rental revenue   resulting from a  n     8  % decrease in average owned container per diem rental rates   and a decrease of $1.8 million reflecting lost revenue   related to Hanjin   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .   The reduction in average container per diem rental rates has been caused by competitive market pressure, as well as our investment in used containers through sale and leaseback transactions. Used containers are purchased at a lower price, and command a lower per diem rental rate, than new containers. Approximately   9  % of our investment in containers during the last twelve months was in used containers. 

New container prices have declined in recent periods, primarily due to a drop in steel prices, leading to decreases in container per diem rates. Demand for new containers has also softened, primarily due to economic conditions in China, resulting in a decline in container rental revenue that may continue in future periods. As a result of current conditions in the container market   and our diversification strategy,   we are investing more heavily in railcars and expect our revenues in this business to grow in future periods. 

Rail Lease Income.   Rail lease income increased $  2.5   million, or   49  %, to $7.  6   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016 from $  5.1   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2015,   primarily   as a result of a   54  % increase in the average size of our   on-lease   railcar fleet during the last   twelve   months.   The average lease income per railcar has also increased as new railcars  , which command higher per diem rental rates than used railcars,   now form a larger percentage of the fleet.

Table of Contents  

Logistics Revenue.   Logistics revenue   increased $15.8 million, or 292%, to   $  21.2   million   for the three month ended   September   30, 2016 from $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was   mainly attributable to the acquisition of   Challenger in February 2016   and   Hybrid     in June 2016  . 

Management Fee Revenue.   Management fee revenue   de  creased $  0.  4   million, or   49  %, to $  0.  5   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016     from $  0  .  9   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2015  ,   primarily due to   a    2  1  % reduction in the size of the on-lease managed container fleet   as a result of our purchase of previously managed container portfolios,   and a decrease of   1  7  % in average per diem rates in our managed fleet for the three months ended   September     30  , 2016  ,   compared to the three months ended   September     30  , 2015  . 

The size of our managed fleet has decreased in the past several years as market conditions have favored the purchase of container portfolios from our managed container fleet rather than establishing new portfolios. We continue to believe that the management of equipment for third party investors is beneficial to our company and we will continue to pursue those opportunities. At the same time, based on market conditions, we intend to continue to pursue the purchase of container portfolios from our managed fleet if attractive opportunities present themselves. Consequently, market conditions will dictate whether there will be net additions or subtractions from our managed fleet. 

Expenses.      The following discussion explains the significant changes in expenses for the three months ended   September   30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September   30  , 2015  : 

Depreciation of Rental Equipment.   Depreciation of rental equipment increased by $  7.2   million, o  r    32  %, to $2  9.9   million     for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016  , from $  22.7   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2015  . This increase was   a  ttributable to an increase of   $3.  4     million as a result of a decrease in our estimate of residual value for 40-foot high cube dry van containers   (see Critical Accounting Policie  s and Estimates  )  , a $2.0 million impairment charge  , net of insurance recoveries,   related to estimated irrecoverable equipment on lease to   Hanjin  , an increase of   $  1.  0   million in depreciation   in   CAI Rail, reflecting the increase in size of our railcar fleet over the past   twelve   months  ,   and a $  0.9   million impairment charge recorded during the quarter for certain off-lease damaged containers that we intend to sell  .    

Storage, Handling and Other Expenses.   Storage, handling and other expenses increased by $  0.7   million, or   8  %, to $  8.8   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016  , from $  8.1   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable   to a $  0.  2   million increase in   storage costs   caused by the   average   volume of off-lease   and for sale   owned   container   equipment   increasing   by   9  %    compared to the prior year  .   In addition, repair costs in the   railcar     business increased by $0.  3   million as a result of the increase in the size of the rail fleet.    

Logistics   Transportation Costs  .    L  ogistics   transportation costs     increased by $13.2 million, or 275%, to $18.0 million for the three months ended   September   30, 2016, from $  4.8   million   for the three months ended   September   30, 2015. The increase was   mainly attributable to the acquisition of   Challenger     in February 2016 and Hybrid   in June 2016  . 

Loss   on   Sale     of Used Rental Equipment.     We incurred a loss on the sale of used rental equipment of $  3.3   million during the three months ended   September   30  , 2016, compared to a   gain   of   $  0.  1   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2015  .    While we sold approximately   52  % more used containers compared to prior year, there was a   reduction   of 2  8  %    in   the   average sale price   per unit  , reflecting the decline in new equipment prices   during the past year  , and a reduction of   90  % in the average margin per un  it.     T  he loss on sale has also been impacted by the strengthening of the dollar compared to other currencies, particularly the Euro. 

Administrative Expenses.   A  dministrative expenses increased by $  3  .8   million, or   51  %, to $  1  1  .1   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016  , from $  7.  3   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2015  . The increase was primarily a result of   $  2  .  8   million of administrative expenses incurred by   our new  ly acquired   logistics   businesses   and $2.5 million bad debt expense incurred during the period related to   Hanjin  , partially offset by a $1.0 million credit related to an adjustment to our estimated   contingent consideration   related to   our   acquisition  s  . 

Net Interest Expense  . Net interest expense   in  creased by $  1.  9   million, or   21  %, to   $  10  .  9   million for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016  , from $  9.0   million for the three   months ended   September   30  , 2015  . The   in  crease in net interest expense   was due primarily to a   slight   increase in our average loan principal balance as we continue to increase our borrowings to finance our acquisition of additional rental equipment, particularly in our   r  ail   business  ,   and   a slight increase in average interest rates. 

Income Tax Expense.   Income tax expense   increased by $0.  5    million, or   44  %, to   $1.  8     million f  or the three months ended   September   30  , 2016  , from $1.3 million for   the three months ended September   30  , 2015  . The full year estimated effective tax rate   at     September   30  , 2016  , before certain non-recurring discrete items, was   3  7.1  %, compared to   8.8  % for the three months ended   September   30  ,   2015  .    The   higher   estimated full year effective tax rate at   September   30, 2016   was due   to the increase in the proportion of the railcar fleet s pretax income, combined with a decrease of pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions that has led to a corresponding increase in the proportion of pretax income generated in higher tax jurisdictions.   Income tax expense   was also impacted by our determination that foreign tax credits arising from the sale of a subsidiary could not be utilized, resulting in a non-cash tax charge of $1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Nine   Months Ended   September   30  , 2016   Compared to   Nine   Months Ended   September   30  , 2015    

The following table   summarizes our operating results for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   and 2015 (dollars in thousands): 

Total revenue for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016 increased $  33.1   million, or 1  8  %, compared to the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015, due to a $  10.7   million, or   91  %, increase in rail lease income and a $  36.3   million increase in logistics revenue, partially offset by a $  13.0   million, or   8  %, decrease in container lease income and a $0.  9   million, or   35  %, decrease in management fee revenue. Operating expenses for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016  ,   increased $  6  2  .5   million, or   5  5  %, compared to the   nine months ended September   30,   2015, as a result of a  n    $  11.5   million, or   1  7  %, increase in depreciation expense, a $  5.3   million, or   2  4%, increase in storage, handling and other expenses, a $  30.2   million increase in logistics transportation costs, a  n    $  8.2   million   increase   in   loss   on sale of used rental equipment and a $  7  .2   million, or     3  3  %, increase in administrative expenses.   Total o  ther expenses  , primarily net interest expense,   for the   nine months ended September   30,   2016  ,   increased $  5  .0   million, or 1  8  %, compared with the same   nine  -month period in 2015. The increase in revenue was offset by the increase in operating expenses, and resulted in a $  3  3  .  9     million, or   8  6  %, decrease in net income attributable to CAI common stockholders for the   nine months ended September   30,   2016  ,   compared to the same   nine  -month period in 2015. 

Revenue.   The following discussion explains the significant changes in the composition of our total revenue for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September     30  , 2015: 

Container Lease Income.   Container lease income decreased $  13.0   million, or   8  %, to $  151.3   million for the   nine months ended September   30,   2016, from $  1  64.3   million for the   nine months ended September   30,   2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $  1.5     million decrease in rental revenue attributable to a   1  % decrease in the average number of CEUs of owned containers on lease  ,    a    $  9.4   million decrease in rental revenue resulting from a   6  % decrease in average owned container per diem rental rates  , and a decrease of $1.8 million reflecting lost revenue   related to Hanjin   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The reduction in average container per diem rental rates has been caused by competitive market pressure, as well as our investment in used containers through sale and leaseback transactions and the acquisition of container portfolios from our managed fleet. Used containers are purchased at a lower price, and command a lower per diem rental rate, than new containers. Approximately   9  % of our investment in containers during the last twelve months was in used containers. 

New container prices have declined in recent periods, primarily due to a drop in steel prices, leading to decreases in container per diem rates. Demand for new containers has also softened, primarily due to economic conditions in China, resulting in a decline in container rental revenue that may continue in future periods. As a result of current conditions in the container market we are investing more heavily in railcars and expect our revenues in this business to grow in future periods. 

Rail Lease Income.   Rail lease income increased $  10.7   million, or   91  %, to $  22.5   million for the   nine months ended September   30,   2016 from $  11.8   million for the   nine months ended September   30,   2015, primarily as a result of a  n     86  % increase in the average size of ou  r    on-lease   railcar fleet during the last twelve months. The average lease income per railcar has also increased as new railcars, which command higher per diem rental rates than used railcars, now form a larger percentage of the fleet. 

Logistics Revenue.   Logistics revenue   increased $36.3 million, or 663%, to   $  41.7   million   for the   nine months ended September     30, 2016 from $5.5 million for the   nine months ended September   30, 2015,   mainly attributable to the acquisition of Challenger   in February 2016 and Hybrid   in June 2016  . 

Management Fee Revenue.   Management fee revenue decreased $0.  9   million, or   35  %, to $  1.6   million for the   nine months ended September   30,   2016  ,   from $  2.5   million for the   nine months ended September   30,   2015  ,     primarily due to   a 2  3  % reduction in the size of the on-lease managed container fleet as a result of our purchase of previously managed container portfolios, and a decrease of 17% in average per diem rates in our managed fleet for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016  ,   compared to the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015  , partially offset by a non-recurring charge of $0.8 million recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2015  ,   related to an adjustment of prior period management fees  .

The size of our managed fleet has decreased in the past several years as market conditions have favored the purchase of container portfolios from our managed container fleet rather than establishing new portfolios. We continue to believe that the management of equipment for third party investors is beneficial to our company and we will continue to pursue those opportunities. At the same time, based on market conditions, we intend to continue to pursue the purchase of container portfolios from our managed fleet if attractive opportunities present themselves. Consequently, market conditions will dictate whether there will be net additions or subtractions from our managed fleet. 

Expenses.      The following discussion explains the significa  nt changes in expenses for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016  ,   compared to the   nine   months ended   September   30  , 2015: 

Depreciation of Rental Equipment.   Depreciation of rental equipment increased by $  11.5   million, or   1  7  %, to $  77.4   million     for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016, from $  65.9   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015.   This increase was attributable to an increase of $3.  4     million as a result of a decrease in our estimate of residual value for 40-foot high cube dry van containers   (see Critical Accounting Policies   and Estimates  )  , a $2.0 million impairment charge  , net of insurance recoveries,   related to estimated irrecoverable equipment on lease to   Hanjin  , an increase of $  3  .4 million in depreciation in CAI Rail, reflecting the increase in size of our railcar fleet over the past twelve months, and a $2.7 million impairment charge recorded during the   period   for certain off-lease damaged containers that we intend to sell.  

Storage, Handling and Other Expenses.   Storage, handling and other expenses increased by $  5.3   million, or   24  %, to $  27.2   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016, from $  21.8   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $  4.  2   million increase in storage costs caused by the average volume of off-lease   and for sale   owned container equipment increasing   by   47  %    compared to the prior year.   In addition, repair costs in the   railcar     business increased by $0.  8    million as a result of the increase in the size of the rail fleet.  

Logistics Transportation Costs.   L  ogistics transportation costs   increased by $30.2 million, or 619%, to    $  35  .1   million   for the   nine months ended September   30, 2016, from $4.9 million for the   nine months ended September   30, 2015  , mainly attributable to the acquisition of   Challenger in February 2016 and Hybrid and General Transportation   in June 2016  . 

Loss (Gain) on Sale   of Used Rental Equipment.   We incurred a loss on the sale of used rental equipment of $  8.0   million during the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016, compared to a gain of $0.  2   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015.   While we sold approximately   44  % more used containers compared to prior year, there was   a reduction   of 1  9  %    in   the   average sale price   per unit  , reflecting the decline in new equipment prices during the past year,   and a reduction of   2,435  % in the average margin per unit. The loss on sale has also been impacted by   the strengthening of the dollar compared to other currencies, particularly the Euro.     

Administrative Expenses.   Administrative expenses increased by $  7  .2   million, or   3  3  %, to $  2  8  .8   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016, from $  21.5   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015. The increase was primarily a result of $  5.7   million of administrative expenses incurred by our new  ly acquired   logistics   businesses   and $2.5 million bad debt expense incurred during the period related to   Hanjin  . There were also higher employee-related costs as a result of an increase in headcount, particularly in our   r  ail   and   l  ogistics   businesses.   These increases were partially offset by a $1.0 million credit related to an adjustment to our estimated   contingent consideration   related to   our   acquisition  s  . 

Net Interest Expense  . Net interest expense increased by $  4.6   million, or 1  7  %, to $  31.4   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016, from $  26.8   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015.   The increase in net interest expense was due primarily to an increase in our average loan principal balance as we continue to increase our borrowings to finance our acquisition of additional rental equipment, particularly in our Rail business   and   a slight increase in average interest rates. 

Other Expense.   Other expense of $0.  4   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016   inc  reased $0.  3   million, or   568  %, from   expense   of $0.1 million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015. The   increase   was attributable to a loss on foreign exchange of $0.  4   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016. Gains and losses on foreign currency primarily occur when foreign denominated financial assets and liabilities are either settled or re  -  measured in U.S. dollars. The loss on foreign exchange for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016 was primarily the result of movements in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against the Euro. 

Income Tax Expense.   Income tax expense decreased by $0.  4     million, or   10  %, to $  3.  3     million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016, from $  3.7   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015. The full year estimated effective tax rate at   September   30  , 2016, before certain non-recurring discrete items, was   3  7.1  %, compared to   8.  8  %    at     September   30  , 2015.   The   higher   estimated full year effective tax rate at   September   30, 2016  ,   was due   to the increase in the proportion of the railcar fleet s pretax income, combined with a decrease of pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions that has led to a corresponding increase in the proportion of pretax income generated in higher tax jurisdictions.   Income tax expense   was also impacted by our determination that foreign tax credits arising from the sale of a subsidiary could not be utilized, resulting in a non-cash tax charge of $1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Liquidity and   Capital Resources 

Our principa  l sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations, sales of equipment portfolios, borrowings from financial institutions and equity offerings. We believe that cash flow from operations, future sales of equipment portfolios and borrowing availability under our credit facilities are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.

We have typically funded a significant portion of the purchase price for new equipment through borrowings under our credit facilities. However, from time to time we have funded new equipment acquisitions through the use of working capital. 

Revolving Credit Facilities 

(i)  On March 15, 2013, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, with a consortium of banks to fina  nce the   acquisition of container rental equipment and for genera  l working capital purposes. As of   September     30, 2016  , the maximum commitment under the revolving credit facility was $775.0 million, which may be increased to a maximum of $960.0 million under certain conditio  ns described in the agreement.   As of   September     30, 2016  , we had an outstanding balance of $  5  08.5   million and availability of $  266.4   million under the revolving credit facility (net of $0.1 mill  ion in letters of credit), subject to our ability to meet the collateral requirements under the agreement governing the facility.   Based on the borrowing base and collateral requirements at   September   30, 2016  , the borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was $  74.9   million, assuming no additional contribution of assets.   The entire amount of the facility drawn at any time plus accrued interest and fees is callable on demand in the event of certain specified events of default. 

There is a commitment fee on the unused amount of the total commitment, payable quarterly in arrears. The revolving credit facility provides that swing line loans (short-term borrowings of up to $  25  .0 million in the aggregate that are payable within 10 business days or at maturity date, whichever comes earlier) and standby letters of credit (up to $  30  .0 million in the aggregate) will be available to us. These credit commitments are part of, and not in addition to, the maximum credit commitment. The interest rates vary depending upon whether the loans are characterized as Base Rate loans or Eurodollar Rate loans as defined in   the revolving credit facility.   Interest rates are based on LIBOR for Eurodo  llar loans and Base Rate for Base Rate loans. As of   September     30, 2016  , the average interest rate on the revolving credit facility was   2.  3  %. The revolving credit facility will mature in March 2020. 

We use the revolving credit facility primarily to fund the purchase of containers and for general working capital needs. As of   September 30  , 2016  , we had commitments to purchase $  4.  0   million of   containers   and had rental equipment payable of $  1  8.3   million. We have typically used our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from sales of equipment portfolios to third-party investors to repay our revolving credit facility. As we expand our ow  ned fleet, the revolving credit facility balance will be higher and will result in higher interest expense.  

(ii)  On   October 22, 2015  , we entered into   the Second   Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement for CAI Rail with a consortium of banks  , pursuant to which the prior revolving credit facility was amended  . As of   September   30, 2016  , the maximum credit commitment under the revolving   credit facility   was $  500  .0 million. CAI   Rail s   revolving credit facility may be increased   up   to a maximum of $  700  .0 million, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate. The interest rates vary depending upon whether the loans are characterized as Base Rate loans or Eurodollar loans  ,   as define  d in the revolving credit agreement. Interest rates are based on LIBOR for Eurodollar loans and Base Rate for Base Rate loans. As of   September   30, 2016  , the average interest rate under the agreement was   2.0  %. 

As of   September   30, 2016  , the outstanding balance under CAI Rail s revolving credit facility was $  2  02.5   million. As of   September   30, 2016  , we had $  2  97.5   million in availability under the facility, subject to our ability to meet the collateral requirements under the agreement governing the facility.   Based on the borrowing base and collateral requirements at   September   30, 2016  , the borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was $  2.0   million, assuming no additional contribution of assets.   The entire amount of the facility drawn at any time plus accrued interest and fees is callable on demand in the event of certain specified events of default. The revolving credit facility   for CAI Rail   matures   in   October 2020  . 

We use the revolving credit facility primarily to fund the purchase of railcars. As of   September   30, 2016  , we had commitments to purchase $  2  00.7   million of railcars; $  1  55.2   million in the twelve months ending   September   30  , 2017  , $  32.1   million in the twelve months ending   September   30  , 2018 and    $  13.4   million in the twelve months ending   September   30  , 2019.     We also had rental equipment payable of $  6.1   million as of   September   30, 2016. 

(iii)   On September 23, 2016,   we entered into   a Revolving Credit Agreement   for CAI International GmbH   with a financial institution to finance the acquisition of rental equipment. As of September 30, 2016, the maximum credit commitment under the revolving credit facility was EUR 25.0 million. Borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate. Interest rates are based on EURIBOR. As of September 30, 2016,   we   had not drawn on the facility. The entire amount of the facility drawn at any time plus accrued interest and fees is callable on demand in the event of certain specified events of default. The revolving credit facility matures in September 2020. 

Term Loan Facilities 

(i)  On March 22, 2013, we entered into a $30.0 million five-year loan agreement with Development Bank of Japan (DBJ). The loan   is payable in 19   q  uarterly installments of $0.5 million starting July 31, 2013 and a final payment of $21.5 million on April 30, 2018. The loan bears a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. As of   September   30, 2016  , the loan had a balance of $  24.  2   million and an average interest rate of   2.6  %.

(ii)  On December 20, 2010, we entered into a term loan agreement with a consortium of banks. Under this loan agreement, we were eligible to borrow up to $300.0 million, subject to certain borrowing conditions, which amount is secured by certain assets of our whol  ly owned foreign subsidiaries.   The loan agreement is an amortizing facility with a term of six years. The interest rates vary depending upon whether the loans are characterized as Base Rate loans or Eurodollar rate loans, as defined in the term loan agreement. The loan bears a variable interest rate based on LIBOR for Eurodollar loans and Base Rate for base rate loans.    

On March 28, 2013, the term loan agreement was amended which reduced the principal balance of the loan from $249.4 million to $125.0 million through payment of $124.4 million from the proceeds of the $229.0 million fixed-rate asset-backed notes issued by the Company s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CAL Funding II Limited (see paragraph (ii) of   Asset-Backed Notes   below)  . 

On October 1, 2014, we entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement, pursuant to which the prior loan agreement was refinanced.

On June 30, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated term   loan   agreement, pursuant to which the prior loan agreement was refinanced. The amended and restated term loan agreement, which contains similar terms to the prior loan agreement, was amended to, among other things: (a) provide us with the ability to increase the commitments under the facility   to a maximum of     $100.0   million, subject to certain conditions, (2) extend the maturity date to   June 30, 2021  , and (c) revise certain of the covenants and restrictions under the prior agreement to provide us with additional flexibility.   The term loan s outstanding principal is amortized quarterly, with quarterly payments equal to 1.75% multiplied by the original outstanding principal.   The amended and restated term loan agreement bears a variable inte  rest rate based on LIBOR for Eurodollar loans, and Base Rate for base rate loans. As of   September     30, 2016, the loan had a balance of $  98.3   million and an interest rate of 2.  4  %. 

(iv) On December 22, 2015, we entered   into a $20.0 million five-year term loan agreement for CAI Rail with   a financial institution  . The term loan s outstanding principal bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% per annum and is amortized quarterly. Any unpaid principal and interest is due and payable on December 22, 2020. The proceeds from the term loan were primarily   used to repay outstanding amounts under CAI Rail s revolving credit facility. As of   September   30, 2016  , the loan had a balance of $  19.  2     mi  llion. 

(v  )   On   August 30, 2016,   we   entered into a term loan agreement of up to $100.0 million with a consortium of banks for the acquisition of railcars, subject to certain borrowing conditions, which is secured by certain   of our   railcars and other assets.

Other Debt Obligations 

On September 13, 2012,   our   wholly-owned subsidiary  ,    Container Applications Limited (CAL  )  , entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which CAL issued $103  .0   million of its 4.90% Senior Secured Notes due September 13, 2022 (the Notes) to the investors  .

On June 25, 2014, one of the Japanese investor funds that is consolidated by us as a VIE (see Note   4   to our unaudited consolidated financial statements) entered into a term loan agreement with a bank. Under the terms of the agreement, the Japanese investor fund entered into two loans; a five  -  year, amortizing loan of $9.2 million at a fixed interest rate of 2.7%, and a five  -  year, non-amortizing loan of $1.6 million at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The debt is secured by assets of the Japanese investor fund, and is subject to certain borrowing conditions set out in the loan agreement. As of   September   30, 2016  , the term loans held by the Japanese investor fund totaled $  5.8   million and had an average interest rate of   2.  7  %. 

A  s of   September     30, 2016  , we had collateralized financing obligations totaling $  91.6     million (see Note   4   to our unaudited conso  lidated financial statements).   The obligations had an average interest rate of   1.0  % as of   September   30, 2016  ,   with maturity dates between   November   2016   and   September   2019.    

Our term loans, senior secured notes, asset-backed notes, collateralized financing obligations, term loans held by VIEs and capital lease obligations are secured by specific pools of rental equipment and other assets owned by the Company, the underlying leases thereon and the Company s interest in any money received under such contracts. 

In addition to customary events of default, our revolving credit facilities and term loans contain restrictive covenants, including limitations on certain liens, indebtedness and investments.  In addition, all of our debt facilities contain various restrictive financial and other covenants.  The financial   covenants in our debt facilities require us to maintain  :   (1) a consolidated funded debt to consolidated tangible net worth ratio of   no more than   3.75:1.00  , and in the case of our asset-backed notes, of no more than 4.50:  1.00  ; and (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio of   at least   1.20:1.00  , and in the case of our asset-backed notes, of at least 1.10:1.00  . As of   September   30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 

Under certain conditions, as defined in our credit agreements with our banks and/or note holders, we are subject to certain cross default provisions that may result in an acceleration of principal repayment  s   if an uncured default condition were to exist. Our asset-backed notes are not subject to any such cross default provisions.

Operating Activities Cash Flows 

Net cash provided by operating activities of $  9  3.9     million for the   nine   months ended   September   30  , 2016  ,     de  creased   $  1  6.0   million from $  109.9   million for the   nine months ended September   3  0  , 2015  . The   de  crease was due to a $  10  .9     million   de  crease in net income as adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items   and    a    $  5  .0     million   decrease   in our net working capital adjustments.   The decrease in net income as adjusted for non-cash items was primarily due to a $  3  4.0   million decrease in net income   and a $1.0 million reduction in contingent consideration  , partially offset by an increase of $  11.4   million in depreciation expense  ,   an increase of $  8.2   million in loss on sale of used rental equipment  , an increase of $2.1 million in bad debt expense   as a result of the Hanjin bankruptcy  , and a $1.  7     million increase in deferred income taxes  .     Net working capital   used in operating activities of   $  5  .  2     million in the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016  ,     was   due to a    $  7.6     million increase in accounts receivable, primarily caused by   an increase in rail lease billings and   the timing of receipts  ,   partially offset by   a   $  1  .  5     million   in  crease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, primarily caused by the timing of payments  ,     and a $  1.0   million increase in   unearned rev  enue  . Net working capital   used     in   operating activities of    $  0.2   million in the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015  ,     was   due to a   $5.  4   million decrease in amounts due to investors, primarily as a result of a decrease in the average managed container fleet, partially offset by a   $  2.  7   million     de  crease   in accounts receivable, primarily caused by the timing of receipts, and a $  2.3   million   in  crease in   unearned revenue, caused by an increase in the amount of advanced billings. 

Investing Activities Cash Flows 

Net cash used in investing activities   de  creased $  118.3   million to $  1  23.2   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016  ,   from $  241.5   million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015  . The   de  crease in cash usage was primarily attributable to a $  1  34.0   million   de  crease in the purchase of rental equipment   and a $1.3 million increase in receipt of princi  pal payments from direct financing   lea  s  es  , partially offset by   an increase of $11.5 million for the acquisition   of our new logistics companies   and a $5.1 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of used containers  .   

Fina  ncing Activities Cash Flows  

Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016  ,     de  creased $  12  7.9   million compared to the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015  ,   primarily as a result of   lower   net borrowings being required to finance the acquisition of rental equipment. During the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016  , our net cash   inflow   from borrowings was $  24.2   million compared to $  1  49.5     million for the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015  , reflecting   a   de  crease in investment in rental equipment during the   nine months ended September   30  , 2016  ,   compared to the   nine months ended September   30  , 2015  .   The decrease was also attributable to a decrease of $4.  7   million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options  , partially offset by a decrease of $3.0 million used to repurchase our stock   pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase plan  .    

Stock Repurchase Plan 

On December 14, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to one million shares of our outstanding common stock.     On February 4, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a one million share increase in the previously approved share repurchase program bringing the total authorized for repurchase to two million shares of our outstanding common stock. T  he number, price, structure and timing of the repurchases, if any, will be at our sole discretion and future repurchases will be evaluated by us depending on market conditions, liqu  idity needs and other factors.   Stock repurchases may be made in the open market, block trades or priv  ately negotiated transactions.   The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not oblige us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock  . During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased and retired 260,531 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $7.88 per share for an aggregate price of approximately $2.1 million excluding related commission charges, under our publicly-announced repurchase plan. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 0.8 million shares remained available for repurchase under our share repurchase plan.

Contractu  al Obligations and Commercial Commitments 

The following table sets for  th our contractual obligations and commercial commitments by due date as of   September   30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1) 

Our estimate   of interest expense commitment includes $  56.4   million relating to our revolving credit facilities, $  2  8.1   million relating to our term loans, $  1  6.0   million relating to our senior secured notes, $  2  7.5   million relating to our asset back notes, $  3.3   million relating to our collateralized financing obligations,   and   $0.  2     million relat  ing   to our term loans held by VIEs. The calculation of interest commitment related to our debt assumes the following w  eighted-average interest rates as of   September   30, 2016  : revolving credit facilit  ies,   2.  2  %; term loans,   2.  6  %; se  nior secured notes, 4.9%; asset-backed notes, 3.4%; collateralized financing obligations  ,    1.0  %;   and   term loans held by VIE  , 2.  7  %.   These calculations assume that weighted-average interest rates will remain at the same level over the next five years. We expect th  at interest rates will vary over time based upon fluctuations in the underlying indexes upon which these rates are based.     

See Note   9     to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q   for a description of the terms of our debt. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of   September   30, 2016  , we had no   material   off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations other than noted below. An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which we would have: (1) retained a contingent interest in transferred assets; (2) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity; (3) any obligation arising out of a material variab  le interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us; or (4) made guarantees. 

We transferred ownership of certain equipment to Japanese equipment funds which were established by Japan Investment Adviser Co., Ltd. (JIA) and CAIJ.   Prior to April 2016   CAIJ   was   an 80%-owned subsidiary of CAI with the remaining 20% owned by JIA. Prior to the purchase of equipment from us, the purchasing entities received contributions from unrelated Japanese investors, under separate Japanese investment agreements allowed under Japanese commercial laws. The contributions were used to purchase equipment from us. Under the terms of the agreements, the CAI-related Japanese entities manage  d   each of the investments but may outsource the whole or part of each operation to a third party. Pursuant to its services agreements with investors, the Japanese equipment funds outsourced the general management of their operations to CAIJ. The Japanese equipment funds also entered into equipment management service agreements and financing arrangements whereby we manage the leasing activity of equipment owned by the Japanese equipment funds. The profit or loss from each investment will substantially belong to each respective investor, except with respect to certain financing arrangements where the terms of the transaction provide us with an option to purchase equipment at a fixed price. If we decide to exercise our purchase options and resell equipment to a third party, we would realize any profit from the sale. See Notes   4   and 1  4   to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Container   rental   equipment is recorded at   original   cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives and residual values of   our   container equipment are based on historical disposal experience and   our   expectations for future used container sale prices.   Depreciation estimates are reviewed   on a regular basis to determine whether changes have taken place that would suggest that a change in depreciation   estimates  , useful lives of   our   equipment or the assigned residual values, is warranted. 

After   we   conducted   our   regular depreciation policy review,   we     concluded that a change in   the estimated residual value for 40-foot high cube dry van containers from $1,650 to $1,400   per container  , effective July 1, 2016  , was appropriate  .    The change increased our d  epreciation expense by   $3.  4   million  , decreased net income by $3.2 million, and decreased diluted earnings per share by   $0.1  7     for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Depreciation estimates were last change  d   for 40-foot high cube dry van containers (and other container types within   our   fleet) during 2012. Since that time, disposal prices for 40-foot high cube dry van containers have declined and   we   experienced losses when selling certain of these assets during   2015 and   2016. The change in residual value estimate was made to better align residual value with expectations for future used container sale prices. 

In considering changes to residual values for the three major dry van categories, we reviewed 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, and 11-year average disposition pricings trends. As with all estimates, particularly related to long-lived assets, current market performance may not necessarily be indicative of long-term residual values, so we do not adjust residual values to point-in-time prices. Rather, we consider the mix of data shown in the following table and use the average over time to either confirm residual value estimates or support revisions to those estimates. 

The sale-related unit proceeds by dry   v  an container category that we considered as of September 30, 20  1  6  ,   are shown below: 

Our residual value estimates ($1,050 for a 20-ft. dry van, $1,300 for a 40-ft. dry van, and $1,400 for a 40-ft. high cube dry van) are lower in each instance than the historical averages, with the exception of the 3-year average. While we experience  d   losses   when selling certain of these assets during 2015 and 2016  , we do not adjust long-term residual value estimate  s   based on short-term data points, such as current year sale results and the 3-year average shown above, as we do not believe they are indicative of a change in the long-term market value for these containers. We do regularly review this data and update the analysis and will make further revisions to residual value estimates as and when conditions warrant. 

The largest segment of our non-dry   v  an container fleet consists of 20-ft. refrigerated containers and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers. We regularly review the residual value estimates associated with our refrigerated containers. Given the specific nature of these assets and the lower volumes of containers that are sold each year in the secondary market, there is less variability in asset pricing. Similar to our dry van containers, we evaluate the relationship between sales prices and residual values over a long-term horizon. When measured at September 30, 2016, sales proceeds for 20-ft. refrigerated and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers averaged $3,180 and $4,065, respectively, over the prior 3-year period, and $3,219 and $4,111, respectively, over the prior 5-year period. We excluded 7-year and 11-year historical averages from our analysis as we do not have a long enough history of sales for refrigerated containers. The current residual values for 20-ft. refrigerated and 40-ft. high cube refrigerated containers are set at $2,750 and $3,500, respectively. Based on the data trends, we believe that the residual value estimates for our refrigerated containers are appropriate and do not warrant revision. 

We continuously monitor disposal prices across our entire portfolio for indications of a deeper, more sustained market downturn. If necessary, we will adjust our estimates if there are indicators that the current weak market for containers will be sustained over a longer time horizon. 

There have been no   other   changes to our accounting policies during the   nine   months ended   September     30, 2016  .  See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5  ,   filed with the SEC on   March   3  ,    2  016  .

ITEM 3.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE   DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows. We are exposed to the market risks described below. 

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk  . Although we have significant foreign-based operations, the U.S. Dollar is our primary operating currency. Thus, most of our revenue and expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars. We have equipment sales in British Pound Sterling, Euros and Japanese Yen and incur overhead costs in foreign currencies, primarily in British Pound Sterling and Euros. CAI Consent Sweden AB, one   of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, has significant amo  unts of revenue as well as expenses denominated in Euros and Swedish Krone. During the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016  , the U.S. Dollar   increased   in value in relation to other major foreign currencies (such as the Euro and British Pound Sterling). The   increase   in the U.S. Dollar has   decreased   our revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The   increase   in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies will also result in U.S. dollar denominated assets held at some of our foreign subsidiaries to   increase   in value relative to the foreign subsidiaries  local currencies. For the   nine     months ended   September   30, 2016  , we recognized a   loss   on foreign exchange o  f $  0.  4   million. A 10% change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our business, financial position, results of oper  ations or cash flows. 

Interest Rate Risk.   The   nature of our business exposes us to market risk arising from changes in interest rates to which our variable-rate debt is linked. As of   S  eptember   30, 2016  , the principal amount of debt outstanding under the variable-rate arrangement  s   of our revolving credit facilities was $  7  11  .0   million.   In addition, at   September   30, 2016  , we had balances on our variable  -  rate term loans of $  2  5  4.4   million   and     term loans held by VIE of $  5.8   million  . The average interest rate on our variable rate debt was     2.  3  % as of   September   30, 2016  ,   based on LIBOR plus a m  argin based on certain   conditions   set forth in our debt agreements  . 

A 1.0% increase or decrease in underlying interest rates for these   debt   obligations will increase or decrease interest expense by approximately   $  9.7   million annually assuming debt remains constant at   September   30, 2016  ,   levels. 

We do not currently participate in hedging, interest rate swaps or other transactions to manage the market risks described above. 

ITEM 4.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15  (e)   and 15d-15  (e)   of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   Based upon such evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of   September     30, 2016   our disclosure controls and procedures were effective with respect to controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the   SEC   s rules and forms and are accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under Exchange Act) that occurred during the   quarter   ended   September   30, 2016  , which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II       OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.        LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time we may be a party to litigation matters or disputes arising in the ordinary course of business, including in connection with enforcing our rights under our leases. Currently, we are not a party to any legal proceedings which are material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A.        RISK   FACTORS 

Before making an investment decision, investors should carefully consider the risks described below and in the  Risk Factors  in Part 1: Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5   filed with the SEC on   March   3  , 2016  . These risks are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could fluctuate due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form10-Q.   Except as set forth below, there   have been no material changes in our risk factors from those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5  . 

Lessee defaults may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow 

We believe that the risk of large lessee defaults remains elevated. Excess vessel capacity over the last several years has led to low ocean freight rates  ,   which has resulted in large financial losses   for certain carriers  .    For example,   Hanjin, the world s 7  th   largest container shipping line, declared bankruptcy on August 31, 2016, and     a second     major     shipping line     entered into restructuring negotiations with   its     creditors  , which   was successfully   completed   as of September 30, 2016  . We expect ex  cess vessel capacity to persist and freight rates to remain   under pressure  , which could adversely affect the credit worthiness of our customers.   The Hanjin bankruptcy resulted in us recording charges of $4.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016. Additional   large lessee default  s   could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 

ITEM 2.        UNREGISTERED   SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

_______________________________________________________ 

(1) 

On December 14, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to one million shares of our outstanding common stock.   On February 4,   2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a one million share increase in the previously approved share repurchase program bringing the total authorize  d for repurchase to two million shares of our outstanding common stock.   The repurchase plan does not have an expiration date.   During the three months ended   September   30  , 2016, we repurch  ased and retired   260,531   shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $  7.  88   per share for an aggregate price of approximately $  2  .1   million excluding related commission charges, under our publicly-announced repurchase plan. As of   September   30  , 2016,   approximately   0.8   mi  llion shares remained available for repurchase under our share repurchase plan.
