NOTE
1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

PREMIER
PRODUCTS GROUP, INC. (the Company ) has prepared the accompanying financial statements without audit. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows for all periods presented herein, have been made.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31,
2015 audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on May 18, 2016. The results of operations for the period ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
Company s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company has a working capital deficit and has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to
cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.  

These
factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it consummates
a business combination. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.  

In
order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s
plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient
to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances
that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
3   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes.  This statement
requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic No.
740,  Accounting for Income Taxes,  on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of ASC Topic No. 740, the
Company recognized no liability for unrecognized tax liabilities. The Company has no tax positions at December 31, 2015 and 2014
for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.  

Interest
Accruals   

The
Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax liabilities in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.
During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized interest accruals of $10,186 and $4,868, respectively.  

Loss
Per Share   

The
computation of loss per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period presented in accordance
with ASC Topic No. 260,   Earnings Per Share.   

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

Management
has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. The Company s
management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.  

On
June 10, 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10,  Development
Stage Entities (Topic 915):  Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest
Entities Guidance in Topic 810, consolidation,   which removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from GAAP
for development stage entities, including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. For the first
annual period beginning after December 15, 2014, the presentation and disclosure requirements in Topic 915 will no longer be required
for the public business entities. The revised consolidation standards are effective one year later, in annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted the amendment as of fiscal year ended December 31,
2014.  

There
are several new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, which are not yet effective. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable,
has been or will be adopted by the Company. As of September 30, 2016, none of these pronouncements is expected to have a material
effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  

Impact
of New Accounting Standards   

The
FASB periodically issues new accounting standards in a continuing effort to improve standards of financial accounting and reporting.
The Company has reviewed the recently issued pronouncements. During this review, the Company decided to early adopt ASU 2014-10,
which eliminates the definition of a development stage entity, eliminates the development stage presentation and disclosure requirements
under ASC 915, and amends provisions of existing variable interest entity guidance under ASC 810.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, amounts due to a related party, accounts payable and accrued
expenses, and derivative liabilities. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, establish
a framework for measuring fair value, establish a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value,
and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.  

The
Company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs, including warrants not indexed to the Company s
stock. The Company is required to record its derivative instruments at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
are recognized in earnings in accordance with ASC 815.  

The
fair value of the derivative instruments are determined based on  Level 3  inputs, which consist of inputs that are
both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. We believe that the recorded values of all of our other
financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates
or durations.  

The
Company has categorized its financial instruments, based on the priority of inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level
fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  

Financial
assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:  

Level
1 Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities
in an active market that management has the ability to access.  

Level
2 Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs
that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (commodity derivatives
and interest rate swaps).  

Level
3 Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both
unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management s own assumptions about
the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.

  Notes
to the Financial Statements  

  September
30, 2016  

  (Unaudited)  

When
the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement
is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company
conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs
may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities.

over control of the note and subsequently retired the debt in the amount of $273,774, resulting in a gain on discharge of debt
on the Statement of Operations.

NOTE
6   FIX ASSETS AND IMPAIRMENTS   

In
December 2014, the Company acquired a Grow Pod in exchange for 16,125,000 shares of common stock. At the time of the transaction,
the common stock of the Company was valued at $0.008 per share for a total booked asset of $129,000. Subsequently, the Company
impaired the asset to its current replacement cost valued at $50,000 based on estimates from contractors. The difference between
the purchase price and the replacement cost is attributed to the intellectual property applied to the configuration of the asset.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Company added electrical improvements to the Pod in the amount of $1,000.
As of the filing, and in conjunction with the departure of our prior CEO, the Company is not aware of the current location of
the Pod. Therefore, while the Company maintains legal ownership of the Pod, the Company has chosen to fully impair the Pod due
to the unknown whereabouts. The transaction has been accounted for as follows:  

NOTE
7   NOTES PAYABLE AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITY   

Notes
Payable   

At
the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company had third party notes payable and accrued interest in the amount of $342,878
compared to $337,109 in the prior fiscal year. The notes included notes to four unaffiliated parties at interest rates of between
6% and 8% per year. The notes expire during the 2015 and 2016 fiscal year and are not secured by collateral of the Company. Several
of these notes are in default and the Company is in communication with the holders to resolve these outstanding issues. The notes
are convertible into common stock, at the election of the holder, at discounts of between 40% and 50%. Two additional notes, totaling
$11,250 are convertible into common stock of the Company at $0.001. The two notes payable are contingent liability that are either
in dispute or the Company is unable to substantiate.  

Derivative
Liability   

The
Company entered into an agreement, which has been accounted for as a derivative. The Company has recorded a loss contingency associated
with this agreement because it is both probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be
estimated. The main factors that will affect the fair value of the derivative are the number of the Company s shares outstanding
post acquisition or post offering and the resulting market capitalization.  

ASC
Topic 815 ( ASC 815 ) requires that all derivative financial instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value. Fair values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not
readily available, fair values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and
requiring judgment and estimates.

The
Company issued warrants and has evaluated the terms and conditions of the conversion features contained in the warrants to determine
whether they represent embedded or freestanding derivative instruments under the provisions of ASC 815. The Company determined
that the conversion features contained in the warrants represent freestanding derivative instruments that meet the requirements
for liability classification under ASC 815. As a result, the fair value of the derivative financial instruments in the warrants
is reflected in the Company s balance sheet as a liability. The fair value of the derivative financial instruments of the
warrants was measured at the inception date of the warrants and each subsequent balance sheet date. Any changes in the fair value
of the derivative financial instruments are recorded as non-operating, non-cash income, or expense at each balance sheet date.  

The
Company valued the conversion features in its warrants using the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model values the embedded
derivatives based on a risk-free rate of return of 0.0131%, grant dates at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the term
of the warrant extending 3 years from the date of a  reverse merger , conversion of warrant shares is equal to 0.005%
of the then outstanding common stock of the company, the conversion price is $0.001, current stock prices on the measurement date
ranging from $0.0017 to $0.0980, and the computed measure of the Company s stock volatility, ranging from 220% to 580%.  

Included
in the September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 financial statements is a derivative liability in the amount of $2,620 and $681,
respectively, to account for this transaction. It is revalued quarterly henceforth and adjusted as a gain or loss to the consolidated
statements of operations depending on its value at that time.  

Included
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and year-end December 31, 2015 are $6,974
and $1,118 in change of fair value of derivative in non-cash charges pertaining to the derivative liability as it pertains to
the gain (loss) on derivative liability and debt discount, respectively.   

NOTE
8   ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $348,365,
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 of $768,022. The accounts payable and accrued expenses include $191,885 in legal
and professional fees and $144,000 to related parties for work performance.  

NOTE
9   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

Contingent
Liabilities   

The
Company recorded contingent and legal liabilities for the period ending September 30, 2016 for $242,283. The legal liability includes
$167,283 for settlement of an arbitration dispute plus accrued interest and fees, and contingent liability of a $75,000 note payable,
as further defined below. Also included in contingent liability are two additional prior notes payable in the amount $10,000 and
$140,200.  

The
Company recorded contingent and legal liabilities for the period ended September 30, 2016 for $392,483. The legal liability includes
$167,283 for settlement of an arbitration dispute as further defined below. Additional contingent liabilities have been accounted
for in the amount of $150,200 and $75,000 for notes payable. These notes date back to the purchase of the mineral properties with
a related party. The Company believes that these notes are to be discharged, however, until additional research and agreements
have been reached, the Company is treating the amount as a contingent liability.  

In
March 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a third party. A dispute arose with respect to the Company s
performance under such settlement agreement and, in accordance with the terms of such agreement, such party moved for arbitration
to resolve such dispute. The matter has been closed as of September 2016, with the Company recording a legal liability in the
amount of $125,000, plus $42,283 in accrued penalties and fees, to account for liability they have incurred.

performance under such settlement agreement and, in accordance with the terms of such agreement, such party moved for arbitration
to resolve such dispute. The matter has been closed as of September 2016, with the Company recording a legal liability in the
amount of $125,000, plus $42,283 in accrued penalties and fees, to account for liability they have incurred.  

On
February 24, 2015, the Company was named a defendant in a complaint filed by John Michael Coombs in the Third Judicial District
Court in and For Salt Lake County, State of Utah, alleging, among other things, Breach of Contract, in connection with a Warrant
Agreement issued by the Company to Mr. Coombs in 2010. Management has informed Mr. Coombs that it fully intends to honor the Warrant
Agreement and is in discussions to settle this matter.

On

to the Definitive Agreement and in connection with the Acquisition, the Company will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock

NOTE
11   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

On
September 18, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive letter of intent to acquire Satic, Inc. ( Satic USA )  www.saticusa.com ,
an American manufacturer of a proprietary line of trademarked clean power solar products and other patented energy saving products
and lighting. Terms of the letter of intent have not been finalized pending due diligence. The previously announced acquisition
of GEAR Sports Nutrition has been terminated. After final due diligence, a closer look revealed GEAR s primary business
relationships not up to standard and therefore not in the shareholders  best interest. From the outcome of those findings,
we terminated the acquisition and management sought to explore other opportunities prior to the resolving the closing, which lead
to the discovery of the exciting and revenue producing Satic USA. Concurrent with the termination of the GEAR transaction, 225
million shares of the Company s common stock will be returned to treasury, reducing the outstanding shares by over 50%;
effective October 2016.   

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other reports filed by PREMIER PRODUCTS GROUP, INC. (the  Company ) from time to
time with the SEC (collectively, the  Filings ) contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information
that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company s management as well as estimates and
assumptions made by Company s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the Filings, the words  anticipate, 
 believe,   estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan, 
or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s management identify
forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject
to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including the risks relating to the Company s business, industry,
and the Company s operations and results of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed,
estimated, expected, intended, or planned.  

Although
the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee
future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities
laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results.  

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.
In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s
judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative
would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  

Plan
of Operation   

As
of the date of this Report, we are a mining company that is currently seeking a viable prospect to develop. We are not limiting
our search to any specific geographic region. Our plan of operation for the twelve months following the date of this Report is
to continue to review potential acquisitions in the resource sector. Currently, we are in the process of completing due diligence
investigation of various opportunities in the base metal and mineral sector. We do not have enough funds currently on hand to
cover our administrative expenses for the next 12 months and therefore we will need additional funding for the review, acquisition,
and development of a mining property once the same is identified. We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the
form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or debt financing.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Total
operating expenses, which included general and administrative expenses incurred during the three-month period, ended September
30, 2016 were $5,652 compared to $34,975 during the similar period in 2015, a decrease of $153,919. This decrease was as a result
of decrease in depreciation expense of $0, management expense of $10,500, professional fees of $1,224, travel, meals, and entertainment
of $-0-, and a decrease in general and administrative expense of $2,071. Additionally, we recorded $0 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 in non-cash gains arising from a gain on discharge of debt, compared to $0 for the three months ended June
30, 2015. Additionally, we recorded other expenses of $5,652 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which included $6,974
loss on derivative liability, $5,652 in interest expense, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, where we recorded
a gain on derivative liability of $1,184 and interest expense of $2,131. We are currently actively engaged in transitioning our
business; incurring costs associated with identifying businesses and expanding our current organic grow pods.  

As
a result, we incurred a net loss of $57,178, approximately $0.00 per share, during our three-month period ended September 30,
2016, compared to a net loss of $ (123,399), approximately ($0.00) per share, during the three-month period ended September 30,
2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash or cash equivalents of $84.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $(46,995) during the three month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $41,607 for
the three month period ended June 30, 2015. The decrease is due to the change in business operations during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, specifically decreases in management and professional fees. We anticipate that overhead costs in current operations
will continue to increase in the future once we identify and acquire additional business opportunities to develop.  

Cash
flows from financing activities were $(46,961) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $62,322 during
the three months ended June 30, 2015 as a result of our issuance of debt instruments. Cash flows provided by investing activities
were ($ 0) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to ($.0) for the three month period ended June 30, 2015.  

Certain
of our shareholders have provided us with loans and contributions aggregating $342,878 as of September 30, 2016. These loans bare
interest of 6% to 8% and are due upon demand. We utilized the funds from these loans to cover our costs for working capital.  

We
are not generating revenue from our operations, and our ability to implement our new business plan for the future will depend
on the future availability of financing. Such financing will be required to enable us to identify and develop alternative growing
methods, new business acquisition opportunities, and continue operations. We intend to raise funds through private placements
of our Common Stock and through short-term borrowing from our shareholders. Because we have not identified or secured a specific
acquisition as of the date of this report we cannot estimate how much capital we will need to fully implement our business plan
in the future and there are no assurances that we will be able to raise this capital. Our inability to obtain sufficient funds
from external sources when needed will have a material adverse effect on our plan of operation, results of operations and financial
condition. We need to raise additional funds in order to continue our existing operations, to initiate new projects and to finance
our plans to expand our operations for the next year.  

Inflation   

Although
our operations are influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results
of operations during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016.  

Critical
Accounting Estimates   

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following represents a summary of
our critical accounting policies, defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often
as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.  

Leases
    We follow the guidance in SFAS No. 13    Accounting for Leases  ,  as amended, which requires
us to evaluate the lease agreements we enter into to determine whether they represent operating or capital leases at the inception
of the lease.  

Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards     As of November 1, 2011, we adopted new guidance on the testing of goodwill impairment
that allows the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two step goodwill impairment assessment
is necessary. Under the option, the calculation of the reporting unit s fair value is not required to be performed unless
as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the
unit s carrying amount. The adoption of this guidance impacts testing steps only, and therefore adoption did not have an
impact on our consolidated financial statements. As of November 1, 2011, we adopted new guidance regarding disclosures about fair
value measurements. The guidance requires that new disclosures related to activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance
requires purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements to be presented separately in the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair
value measurements. There were various other accounting standards and interpretations issued during 2010 and 2011, none of which
are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures,
or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

We
are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide the information under this item pursuant to Regulation S-K.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Report.  

These
controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Based
on management s assessment, management believes that, as of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting
presented a material weakness. The assessment is based on the nature of the acts taken by the prior CEO, Mr. Johnson, leading
up to his quick departure. We also did not effectively implement comprehensive entity level internal controls and were unable
to adequately segregate duties within the accounting department due to an insufficient number of staff, and implement appropriate
information technology controls.  

Inherent
Limitations   

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any system of controls is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdown can occur because of simple error or mistake. In particular,
many of our current processes rely upon manual reviews and processes to ensure that neither human error nor system weakness has
resulted in erroneous reporting of financial data.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. As such, there remains a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting.  

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

On
February 24, 2015, the Company was named a defendant in a complaint filed by John Michael Coombs in the Third Judicial District
Court in and For Salt Lake County, State of Utah, alleging, among other things, Breach of Contract, in connection with a Warrant
Agreement issued by the Company to Mr. Coombs in 2010. Management has informed Mr. Coombs that it fully intends to honor the Warrant
Agreement and is in discussions to settle this matter.  

In
March 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with one of its former CEO s Andrew Telsey. A dispute arose
with respect to the Company s performance under such settlement agreement and, in accordance with the terms of such agreement,
such party moved for arbitration to resolve such dispute. An agreement was reached in April 2015 during arbitration; however,
the Company was unable to perform under the settlement agreement. The Company has recorded a liability in the amount of $125,000,
plus accrued interest and fees of 42,283, to account for a total liability of $167,283, which was recorded as a judgment amount
in September 2016.  

Other
than described above and as previously disclosed; we are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or
investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the
knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our
common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities
as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors.
