NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 September 30, 2016 

NOTE 1.  ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:   

SAFE LANES SYSTEMS, INC. (the  Company ),
was incorporated in the State of Colorado on September 10, 2013. The Company was formed to engage in the sale of traffic safety
equipment. The Company may also engage in any other business permitted by law, as designated by the Board of Directors of the Company.
During the second quarter of 2014 the Company secured a perpetual license to all of the intellectual property of Superior Traffic
Control in exchange for the issuance of nonvoting convertible stock in the company. In the second quarter of 2016 the Company determined
that license and related intellectual property should be written off as worthless due to problems with the engineering provided
and the inability to obtain meaningful sales. The Company was redomiciled to become a Delaware Holding Corporation in September
of 2016 and is currently pursuing new business opportunities. 

Basis of Presentation - The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP )
and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information and the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of the Company s management, the information contained herein
reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s results of operations, financial position and
cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. 

Reclassifications - Certain amounts in the
prior period s financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current quarter s presentation and to
correct prior period errors. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Cash Flows - During the period ending September
30, 2016, the Company primarily utilized cash proceeds from an unsecured short term loan and proceeds from a convertible note payable
to fund its operations. 

Cash flows used by operations for the period
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $34,911 and $186,689 respectively. 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash
equivalents of $7,871 as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $15,282 as of December 31, 2015. 

Impairment of Long-life Assets  

In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company
reviews its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future
net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and
carrying amount of the asset. No impairment was deemed necessary as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Intangible Assets, Patents  

During the second quarter of 2014 fiscal year
the Company acquired the exclusive license rights and intellectual property for the patent of the Kone General device which expires
July 2022. As payment for the license rights the company agreed to issue 22,768,273 shares of class B preferred, nonvoting shares
to the shareholders of the original license holders  Superior Traffic Controls . The Company accounts for its patent
sub-license in accordance with ASC 350-30-30  Intangibles   goodwill and other  and 805-50-30 and 805-50-15 related
to  Business Combinations  by recognizing the fair value to the amount paid by the company for the asset at the time
of purchase. Since Safe Lanes Systems has a limited operating history management determined to use par value as the value recognized
for the transaction. Since the patent has a predetermined, finite life span, the cost of the asset will be recognized on a straight
line basis over the remaining life of the patent. 

At the conclusion of each reporting period
the patent is evaluated for impairment. As of September 30, 2016 due to the lack of sales and determining that incomplete engineering
plans were provided the Company determined it should impair the entire remaining value of the intangible asset and at that time
the remaining value was of $1,683 was written off to impairment expense. 

Amortization expense for the NINE-month period ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 was $149 and $29 respectively. 

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities  

Accounts payable consisted of $42,092 at September
30, 2016 and $1,080 at December 31, 2015 respectively. Accrued expense consisted of $11,308 at September 30, 2016 and $0 at December
31, 2015 respectively. Accrued interest consisted of $27,404 at September 30, 2016 and $14,942 at December 31, 2015 respectively. 

Unsecured, short-term notes payable  

The company obtained an unsecured, short-term
note of $250,000 at 4% from the original holder of the license to the Kone-General patent in the second quarter of 2014. As of
September 30, 2016 the Company had received funding of $250,000 on the note payable and an additional $165,000 under the same terms
with a verbal agreement in place and had recognized $27,404 in accrued interest expense. 

Convertible, long-term notes payable  

The company obtained five unsecured, long-term
notes totaling $7,500 in the third quarter of 2016. The notes do not bear interest until December 31, 2016, after which they will
bear interest at 10% per year. The notes are due and payable December 31, 2017 but can be converted into the company s common
stock at the holders request at any time before they are due. Each note will convert into approximately 4% of the companies then
outstanding common stock. The Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock representing a value of $805 or
$0.0009 per share. Since the stock price was determined to be below this at the time of signing, the notes were issued at a premium
so no value is apportioned to the conversion feature when recording the issuance per ASC 470-20-05. The debt and its interest
are reported as if it were a nonconvertible debt. Upon Conversion, the stock may be valued at either the book value or the market
value at that time. 

Stockholders  Equity  

At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Company was authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share. In addition, 10,000,000 shares
of Class A preferred super majority voting stock, $.0001 par value and 50,000,000 shares of Class B preferred, $.0001 par value
nonvoting convertible shares were authorized. All common stock shares have full dividend rights. However, it is not anticipated
that the Company will be declaring distributions in the foreseeable future. 

Upon formation, the Company sold the founder
2,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock for $1,000 cash. Also upon formation, the Company paid the founder stock based
compensation for services rendered of 10,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value class A preferred super majority voting stock. These
preferred shares have a stated value of par value of $0.0001. The holder of the Class Stock shall have the right to vote on any
matter with holders of Common Stock and may vote as required on any action, which Colorado law provides may or must be approved
by vote or consent of the holders of the specific series of voting preferred shares and the holders of common shares. The Record
Holders of the Class B Preferred Shares shall have that number of votes equal to that number of common shares which is not less
than 60% of the vote required to approve any action, which Colorado law provides may or must be approved by vote or consent of
the holders of other series of voting preferred shares and the holders of common shares or the holders of other securities entitled
to vote, if any 

Upon execution of a patent sublicense agreement
the Company issued 22,768,273 shares of its class B preferred convertible stock to a trustee on behalf of shareholders of the original
license agreement. These shares were converted into regular common stock upon the company registering the underlying shares with
the SEC and distribution to stockholders which occurred in the 2015 fiscal year. 

In the last quarter of 2015 the Company issued
350,000 shares of stock to two contractors for past work. As the Company has issued no stock for cash the Company valued the compensation
based upon par value of $.0001 per share resulting in a compensation expense of $35 per share in the period the stock was issued. 

In the third quarter of 2016 the Company issued
14,881,727 shares to the Company CEO as part of the reorganization into the Delaware Holding Corporation. As the Company has issued
no stock for cash the Company valued the transaction based upon par value of $.0001 per share, resulting in general and administrative
expense of $1,488 in the current period. 

Professional and contractor expenses  

Professional and contractor expenses are comprised of the following
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016: 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Stock Based Compensation  

The Company accounts for share-based payments
pursuant to ASC 718,  Stock Compensation  and, accordingly, the Company records compensation expense for share-based
awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for stock options and restricted stock awards using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. 

Stock compensation expense for stock options
is recognized over the vesting period of the award or expensed immediately under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 when options are given
for previous service without further recourse. The Company issued stock options to contractors that had been providing services
to the Company upon their termination of services. Under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 these options were recognized as expense in the
period issued because they were given as a form of compensation for services already rendered with no recourse. 

The following table summarizes  share-based
compensation expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses during each period presented: 

In the last quarter of 2015 the Company issued
350,000 shares of stock to two contractors for past work. As the Company has issued no stock for cash the Company valued the compensation
based upon par value of $.001 per share resulting in a compensation expense of $35 per share in the period the stock was issued. 

Stock option activity was as follows: 

The following table presents information regarding
options outstanding and exercisable as of September 30, 2016: 

Weighted average contractual remaining term - options outstanding  

0.0 years  

Aggregate intrinsic value - options outstanding  

Warrants exercisable  

1,000,000  

Weighted average exercise price - options exercisable  
       
      $  
      0.20  

The fair value of each option granted is estimated
on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for grants as follows: 

Income Tax  

The Company accounts for income taxes under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ( SFAS 109 ).  Under SFAS 109 deferred taxes are provided
on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry-forwards
and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary differences are the differences
between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date
of enactment. 

Fiscal year  

The Company employs a fiscal year ending December 31. 

Net Income (Loss) per share  

The net income (loss) per share is computed
by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common outstanding. Warrants, stock options, and
common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Company s preferred stock (if any), are not included in the computation
if the effect would be anti-dilutive and would increase the earnings or decrease loss per share. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company is currently in the Development stage and has very limited
revenues. Revenue will be recognized on an accrual basis as earned once operations commence. 

Financial Instruments  

The carrying value of the Company s financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, as reported in the accompanying balance sheet, are stated at fair value. 

Going Concern and Managements  Plans  

As shown in the accompanying financial statements
for the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company has a limited operating history. 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to do so.  The financial statements do not include any adjustment to reflect the possible
future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company has a plan in place to remove this
threat through the issuance of notes payable and common stocks offerings. If the Offering raises at least $250,000,
then the Company s estimated expenses related to the Offering and the expenses related to initial projected operating costs
of the Company will be covered. However, the Company will need to generate more than the expenses of the Offering in order to have
enough capital to execute its business plan. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company has reviewed all recently issued
but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected
to cause a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations. 

Related Party Transactions  

The Company pays its Chief Executive Officer,
Paul Dickman through Mr. Dickman s consulting company, Breakwater Finance, LLC. For the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, management fees were $48,600 and $48,600 respectively. In the third quarter of 2016 the Company issued
14,881,727 shares to the Company CEO as part of the reorganization into the Delaware Holding Corporation 

Subsequent Events  

Subsequent to period end the Company finalized
a reorganization into a Delaware holding corporation and changed its name to Southeastern Holdings, Inc. Additional information
related to this transaction has been presented in our 8-K filed November 3, 2016.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations  

General  

The Company was incorporated
in Colorado in September of 2013. 

The Company had minimal
operations from inception to December 31, 2015. 

The Company is in the business
of marketing and selling traffic safety equipment. We have licensed and sub-licensed I.P. for a spring traffic cone dispenser designed
to protect highway workers, first responders to vehicle collisions and highway incidents, law enforcement personnel, towing operators,
private and public utility workers, as well as pedestrians and motorists. Our flagship product, The Kone General Automatic Safety
Cone Deployment System, is the world s first and only portable safety cone dispensing system. Safe D-Ploy Spring Cones are
patented MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices) compliant highway safety cones. However, due to lack of success in developing
a market for our current product we have fully impaired the intellectual property and license agreement and are currently seeking
a new product to take to market. 

We have begun initial minimal operations and
are currently without revenue. We engaged a marketing consultant to develop a marketing and sales plan for both the spring traffic
cone and our automatic traffic cone dispenser in 2015. We have engaged and are currently under agreement with a globally recognized
manufacturer s representation firm, The Johander Company of Minneapolis, to help guide us into retail markets, build a manufacturer s
representative network, and drive retail sales of our Spring Cone and Safe-D-ploy product accessories. Up to this point these efforts
have not resulted in sustainable sales and the company is currently looking for additional product lines that it can add to its
product offerings though none have been identified at this time. 

We are in the developmental stage of our business.
Since our incorporation September 2013, we have been engaged in securing both exclusive and non-exclusive license agreements for
our key products, designing a marketing plan, and lining up suppliers and manufacturers for production. 

During the 2016 fiscal year, we intend to focus
our efforts on raising additional operating capital and finding additional business areas we can expand into. 

Results of Operations  

There were no revenues
in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and one sale resulting in revenue of $1,725 in the similar calendar period of 2015. 

Expenses decreased from
$188,519 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 to $90,550 in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016. This
decrease was primarily caused by the Company reducing professional fees and services while it determines its ongoing financing
strategy. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

During the nine-months
ended September 30, 2016 the Company received $20,000 from the issuance of notes payable as compared to no funding during the nine-months
ended June 30, 2015. In addition the company received $7,500 from the issuance of convertible notes payable. 

During the twelve -months
ending September 30, 2017 the Company estimates it will need approximately $250,000 to implement its business plan. Other than
the foregoing, the Company does not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably expected to have,
a material impact on sales, revenues or income from continuing operations, or liquidity and capital resources. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

An evaluation was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report
on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures are procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and is communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the NINE-months ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

The Company is not a party to any legal proceeding that it believes
