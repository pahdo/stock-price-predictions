Basis
of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Operating
results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes
thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K relating to Research Frontiers Incorporated (the  Company ) for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Business   

Research
Frontiers Incorporated ( Research Frontiers  or the  Company ) operates in a single business segment which
is engaged in the development and marketing of technology and devices to control the flow of light. Such devices, often referred
to as  light valves  or suspended particle devices (SPDs), use colloidal particles that are either incorporated within
a liquid suspension or a film, which is usually enclosed between two sheets of glass or plastic having transparent, electrically
conductive coatings on the facing surfaces thereof. At least one of the two sheets is transparent. SPD technology, made possible
by a flexible light-control film invented by Research Frontiers, allows the user to instantly and precisely control the shading
of glass/plastic manually or automatically. SPD technology has numerous product applications, including: SPD-Smart  windows,
sunshades, skylights and interior partitions for homes and buildings; automotive windows; sunroofs, sun-visors, sunshades, rear-view
mirrors, instrument panels and navigation systems; aircraft windows; train windows; eyewear products; frames, cases and partitions
protecting light-sensitive artwork, documents and artifacts; and flat panel displays for electronic products. SPD-Smart light
control film is now being developed for, or used in, architectural, automotive, marine, aerospace and appliance applications.  

The Company has historically utilized its
cash and the proceeds from the sale of its investments to fund its research and development of SPD light valves, for marketing
initiatives, and for other working capital purposes. The Company s working capital and capital requirements depend upon
numerous factors, including the results of research and development activities, competitive and technological developments, the
timing and cost of patent filings, and the development of new licensees and changes in the Company s relationships with
its existing licensees. The degree of dependence of the Company s working capital requirements on each of the forgoing factors
cannot be quantified; increased research and development activities and related costs would increase such requirements; the addition
of new licensees may provide additional working capital or working capital requirements, and changes in relationships with existing
licensees would have a favorable or negative impact depending on the nature of such changes. There can be no assurance that expenditures
will not exceed the anticipated amounts or that additional financing, if required, will be available when needed or, if available,
that s its terms will be favorable or acceptable to the Company. Eventual success of the Company and generation of positive
cash flow will be dependent upon the commercialization of products using the Company s technology by the Company s
licensees and payments of continuing royalties on account thereof. To date, the Company has not generated sufficient revenue from
its licensees to fully fund its operations. 

Patent
Costs   

The Company expenses costs relating to the
development or acquisition or enforcement of patents due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of these items. 

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company has entered into a number of license agreements covering its light-control technology. The Company receives minimum annual
royalties under certain license agreements and records fee income on a ratable basis each quarter. In instances when sales of
licensed products by its licensees exceed minimum annual royalties, the Company recognizes fee income as the amounts have been
earned. Certain of the fees are accrued by, or paid to, the Company in advance of the period in which they are earned resulting
in deferred revenue. Such excess amounts are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized into income in future periods as earned.  

Fee
Income   

Fee income represents amounts earned by the
Company under various license and other agreements relating to technology developed by the Company. During the first nine months
of 2016, three licensees accounted for 10% or more of fee income of the Company; these licensees accounted for approximately 30%,
29% and 15%, respectively, of fee income recognized during such period. During the first nine months of 2015, two licensees accounted
for 10% or more of fee income of the Company; these licensees accounted for approximately 33% and 15% respectively of fee income
recognized during this period. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, approximately 17% of revenues was
related to fees generated by a large architectural glass project and no such income from this project was recorded in the comparable
2016 period. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company has granted option/warrants to
consultants. GAAP requires that all stock-based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that
such costs be measured at the fair value of the award. 

The Company has granted options/warrants to
consultants. These awards generally vest ratably over 12 to 60 months from the date of grant and the Company charges to operations
quarterly the current market value of the options using the Black-Scholes method. There were no such charges during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, there were no such charges related to options granted to consultants during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a charge of $10,007 was recorded to
operations reflecting the fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes method with the following weighted average assumptions: 

The
Company did not grant any stock options to employees and directors during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015.  

In connection with the restricted stock grants
to employees and directors, the Company charged $57,967 to operations during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and $173,890
was charged to operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. There were no such charges during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016. 

Income
Taxes   

Since inception, the Company has incurred
losses from operations and as a result has not recorded income tax expense. Benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards
and deferred items have been fully reserved since it is not more likely than not that the Company would achieve profitable operations. 

Equity   

The Company did not sell any equity securities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The Company received proceeds of $535,123
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in connection with stock issued by the exercise of options and warrants previously
granted. 

Treasury
Stock   

The
Company did not repurchase any of its stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Investments

The
Company classifies investments in marketable securities as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase
and periodically re-evaluates such classifications. Trading securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains
and losses included in earnings. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at cost and are adjusted for the amortization or accretion
of premiums or discounts over the life of the related security. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized.
In determining realized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest
and dividends on the investments are accrued at the balance sheet date. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 all investments
were classified as held to maturity and consisted of the following:  

Fair
Value Measurements   

We
value financial instruments using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets that are either directly
or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring
an entity to develop its own assumptions.  

Financial assets accounted for at fair value
on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 include cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately $4.5 million.
These assets are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices for identical securities (Level 1 inputs). 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

New
Accounting Standards   

In
May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) jointly issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606), which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for
GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. In July 2015, the FASB approved a deferral of the
ASU effective date from annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its financial position and results
of operations.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification
of Deferred Taxes. The amendments under the new guidance require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent
in a classified statement of financial position. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities
as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to
all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of adopting this guidance.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement
of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities
under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU
clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized
losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the
balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted
except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific
credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.  

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Updated ( ASU )
No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at,
or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption
of the new guidance is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting, which will change certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees. ASU 2016-09 is effective for
fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the provisions of ASU 2016-09.  

In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight
specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented
and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
provisions of ASU 2016-15.  

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of   

   Financial
Condition and Results of Operations   

Critical
Accounting Policies    

The
following accounting policies are important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and should be read
as an integral part of the discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial position. For additional accounting
policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in our
Form 10-K report for the period ending December 31, 2015.  

The
Company has entered into a number of license agreements covering products using the Company s SPD technology. The Company
receives fees and minimum annual royalties under certain license agreements and records fee income on a ratable basis each quarter.
In instances when sales of licensed products by its licensees exceed minimum annual royalties, the Company recognizes fee income
as the amounts have been earned. Certain of the fees are accrued by, or paid to, the Company in advance of the period in which
they are earned resulting in deferred revenue.  

The
Company expenses costs relating to the development or acquisition of patents due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of these
items. All of our research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Our research and development expenses
consist of costs incurred for internal and external research and development. These costs include direct and indirect overhead
expenses.  

The
Company has historically used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of each option grant.
The Black-Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected lives, and risk-free interest
rates. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties based on market conditions generally
outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense
could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation
expense could be materially impacted in future years.  

On
occasion, the Company may issue consultants either options or warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company at specified
share prices. These options or warrants may vest based upon specific services being performed or performance criteria being met.
In accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring, or in conjunction with selling, goods
or services, the Company would be required to record consulting expenses based upon the fair value of such options or warrants
on the earlier of the service period or the period that such options or warrants vest as determined using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model.  

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. An example of a critical estimate is the full valuation
allowance for deferred taxes that was recorded based on the uncertainty that such tax benefits would be realized in future periods.  

Results
of Operations    

The majority of the Company s fee income
comes from the activities of several licensees participating in the automotive market. The Company currently believes that the
automotive market will be the largest source of its royalty income over the next several years. The Company s royalty income
from this market may be influenced by numerous factors including various trends affecting demand in the automotive industry and
the rate of introduction of new technology in OEM product lines. In addition to these macro factors, the Company s royalty
income from the automotive market could also be influenced by specific factors such as whether the Company s SPD -SmartGlass
technology appears as standard equipment or as an option on a particular vehicle, the number of additional vehicle models that
SPD-SmartGlass appears on, the size of each window on a vehicle and the number of windows on a vehicle that use SPD-SmartGlass,
fluctuations in the total number of vehicles produced by a manufacturer, and in the percentage of cars within model like produced
with SPD-SmartGlass, and changes in pricing or exchange rates. Certain license fees, which are paid to the Company in advance
of the accounting period in which they are earned resulting in the recognition of deferred revenue for the current accounting
period, which will be recognized as fee income in future periods. Also, licensees may offset some or all of their royalty payments
on sales of licensed products for a given period by applying these advance payments towards such earned royalty payments. Because
the Company s license agreements typically provide for the payment of royalties by a licensee on product sales within 45
days after the end of the quarter in which a sale of a licensed product occurs (with some of the Company s more recent license
agreements providing for payments on a monthly basis), and because of the time period which typically will elapse between a customer
order and the sale of the licensed product and installation in a home, office building, automobile, aircraft, boat or any other
product, there could be a delay between when economic activity between a licensee and its customer occurs and when the Company
gets paid its royalty resulting from such activity. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine
months ended September 30, 2015   

The Company s fee income from licensing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $958,337 from $1,628,736 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. A substantial majority of this decrease was principally the result of non-recurring fees earned last year associated
with the Company s participation in the Milan Expo, and non-recurring fee income under several licenses in 2015. To a much
lesser extent, fee income from automobiles and aircraft using the Company s technology was lower in the first nine months
of 2016 due to: (1) lower production levels of certain car models in the period; (2) lower costs to the OEM (and therefore lower
royalties per car to the Company) for glass incorporating the Company s technology on certain car models, and (3) a design
improvement in certain aircraft that caused a short-term reduction in new window installations. These factors were partially offset
by higher sales volumes on other car and aircraft models using the Company s technology. The Company believes that the factors
causing reduced royalty income in the first half of 2016 to be short term. As expected, in the third quarter of 2016 (when the
2017 model year cars are produced by Mercedes-Benz), the Company started to see higher take rates and levels of production in
cars using the Company s technology, as compared to second quarter 2016 levels. The Company expects this improving trend
to continue in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

In the first nine months of 2016, the Company
received royalty revenues from sales of the Magic Sky Control option on the S-Class Coupe, Maybach and S-Class Sedan, and SL and
SLK/SLC roadsters in excess of the minimum annual royalty levels for the two licensees supplying products using the Company s
technology to Daimler. As such, royalties from these five car models will be accretive to the Company s royalty revenue.
Production efficiencies are expected to continue and accelerate with the introduction of the higher vehicle production volumes
for various car models going forward, and the Company expects that lower pricing per square foot of the Company s technology
could expand the market opportunities, adoption rates, and revenues for its technology in automotive and non-automotive applications.
The Company expects to generate additional royalty income from the near-term introduction of additional new car and aircraft models
from other OEMS (original equipment manufacturers), continued growth of sales of products using the Company s technology
for the marine industry in yachts and other watercraft, in trains, in museums, and in larger architectural projects. 

Operating expenses decreased by $353,208 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $2,676,178 from $3,029,386 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease
was principally the result of lower patent costs ($153,000), lower payroll costs ($133,000) principally due to lower noncash stock
and option grant compensation costs of $153,000 in the prior year period. In addition, the Company incurred lower investor relations
and marketing costs ($53,000) and lower professional fees ($18,000). 

Research and development expenditures increased
by $64,124 to $1,160,544 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,096,420 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. This increase was principally the result of higher payroll costs ($86,000) partially offset by lower allocated facility
and office expense costs ($11,000) as well as lower materials costs ($7,000). 

The Company s net investment income
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $25,203 compared to $32,085 earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
due to lower cash available for investment. 

As a consequence of the factors discussed
above, the Company s net loss was $2,853,182 ($0.12 per common share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $2,464,985 ($0.10 per common share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three months ended September 30, 2015    

The Company s fee income from licensing
activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $304,772 from $445,846 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. This decrease was principally due to lower sales levels in automotive, aircraft and museum products and non-recurring
royalty income which occurred during 2015. As noted earlier, sales levels have begun to increase in automotive during the third
quarter of 2016, and are expected to further increase in automotive and in the other markets for the Company s technology
starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Operating expenses decreased by $271,043 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $624,080 from $895,123 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease
was principally the result of lower patent costs ($142,000) as well as lower payroll ($59,000), almost all of which is due to
lower non-cash compensation charges relating to grants of common stock and options to employees, and lower investor relations
and marketing costs ($66,000). 

Research and development expenditures decreased
by $80,693 to $246,755 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $327,448 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
This decrease was principally the result of lower payroll costs ($100,000) partially offset by higher allocated facility and office
expenses ($13,000). 

The Company s net investment income
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,332 compared to $9,405 earned for the three months ended September 30, 2015
with the reduction due to lower cash balances available for investment. 

As a consequence of the factors discussed
above, the Company s net loss was $559,731 ($0.02 per common share) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $767,320 ($0.03 per common share) for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources    

The
Company has primarily utilized its cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and the proceeds from its investments to fund
its research and development, for marketing initiatives, and for other working capital purposes. The Company s working capital
and capital requirements depend upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the results of research and development
activities, competitive and technological developments, the timing and costs of patent filings, and the development of new licensees
and changes in the Company s relationship with existing licensees. The degree of dependence of the Company s working
capital requirements on each of the foregoing factors cannot be quantified; increased research and development activities and
related costs would increase such requirements; the addition of new licensees may provide additional working capital or working
capital requirements, and changes in relationships with existing licensees would have a favorable or negative impact depending
upon the nature of such changes.  

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company s cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by $2,723,648. The decrease was mainly due to cash used
for operations of $2,714,757, the purchase of fixed assets of $8,055, the change in short term investments of $6,836 and by the
proceeds from the sale of a fixed asset of $6,000. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital (total current assets
less total current liabilities) of $5,494,042 and total shareholder s equity of $6,222,623. 

The Company expects to use its cash to fund
its research and development of SPD light valves, its expanded marketing initiatives, and for other working capital purposes.
The Company s working capital and capital requirements depend upon numerous factors, including the results of research and
development activities, competitive and technological developments, the timing and cost of patent filings, the development of
new licensees and changes in the Company s relationships with its existing licensees. The degree of dependence of the Company s
working capital requirements on each of the foregoing factors cannot be quantified; increased research and development activities
and related costs would increase such requirements; the addition of new licensees may provide additional working capital or working
capital requirements, and changes in relationships with existing licensees would have a favorable or negative impact depending
upon the nature of such changes. Based upon existing cash reserves and historical revenues and cash expenditures, the Company
believes that its current cash and cash equivalents would fund its operations through early 2018. There can be no assurances that
expenditures will not exceed the anticipated amounts or that additional financing, if required, will be available when needed
or, if available, that its terms will be favorable or acceptable to the Company. Eventual success of the Company and generation
of positive cash flow will be dependent upon the extent of commercialization of products using the Company s technology
by the Company s licensees and payments of continuing royalties on account thereof. To date the Company has not generated
sufficient revenue from licensees to fully fund its operations.

December 31, 2015. There has been no material change in the disclosure regarding market risk.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our disclosure controls and procedures, as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, with assistance from other members of our management, have reviewed the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
