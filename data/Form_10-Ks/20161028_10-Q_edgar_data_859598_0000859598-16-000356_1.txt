SEACOR HOLDINGS INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 
   
           1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
     The condensed consolidated financial information for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   has been prepared by the Company and has not been audited by its independent registered certified public accounting firm.  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SEACOR Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made to fairly present the Company s financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , its results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , its comprehensive income (loss) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , its changes in equity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and its cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full year or any future periods. 
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States have been condensed or omitted.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Unless the context otherwise indicates, any reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the "Company" refers to SEACOR Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and any reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to "SEACOR" refers to SEACOR Holdings Inc.  Capitalized terms used and not specifically defined herein have the same meaning given those terms in the Company's Annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Revenue Recognition.    The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.  Revenue is realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.  Revenue that does not meet these criteria is deferred until the criteria are met. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , deferred revenues of   $6.8 million  , included in other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, related to the time charter of several offshore support vessels scheduled to be paid through the conveyance of an overriding royalty interest (the  Conveyance ) in developmental oil and gas producing properties operated by a customer in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  Payments under the Conveyance, and the timing of such payments, were contingent upon production and energy sale prices.  On August 17, 2012, the customer filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  The Company is vigorously defending its interest in connection with the bankruptcy filing; however, payments received under the Conveyance subsequent to May 19, 2012 are subject to creditors  claims in bankruptcy court.  The Company will recognize revenues when reasonably assured of a judgment in its favor.  All costs and expenses related to these charters were recognized as incurred. 
    Property and Equipment.    Equipment, stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated salvage value.  With respect to each class of asset, the estimated useful life is based upon a newly built asset being placed into service and represents the time period beyond which it is typically not justifiable for the Company to continue to operate the asset in the same or similar manner.  From time to time, the Company may acquire older assets that have already exceeded the Company s useful life policy, in which case the Company depreciates such assets based on its best estimate of remaining useful life, typically the next survey or certification date.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated useful life (in years) of each of the Company s major categories of new equipment was as follows: 
                 Offshore support vessels (excluding wind farm utility) 
    20 
      Wind farm utility vessels 
    10 
      Inland river dry-cargo barges 
    20 
      Inland river liquid tank barges 
    25 
      Inland river towboats 
    25 
      Product tankers - U.S.-flag 
    25 
      Short-sea Container/RORO   (1)        vessels 
    20 
      Harbor and offshore tugs 
    25 
      Ocean liquid tank barges 
    25 
      Terminal and manufacturing facilities 
    20 

______________________ 
           (1) 
    Roll on/Roll off ( RORO ). 
     Equipment maintenance and repair costs and the costs of routine overhauls, drydockings and inspections performed on vessels and equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred.  Expenditures that extend the useful life or improve the marketing and commercial characteristics of equipment as well as major renewals and improvements to other properties are capitalized. 
  Certain interest costs incurred during the construction of equipment are capitalized as part of the assets  carrying values and are amortized over such assets  estimated useful lives.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , capitalized interest totaled   $14.3 million  . 
    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.    The Company performs an impairment analysis of long-lived assets used in operations, including intangible assets, when indicators of impairment are present.  These indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.  If the carrying value of the assets is not recoverable, as determined by the estimated undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the assets is reduced to fair value, if lower.  Generally, fair value is determined using valuation techniques, such as expected discounted cash flows or appraisals, as appropriate.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized impairment charges of   $51.7 million   and   $6.9 million  , respectively, related to long-lived assets held for use. 
  When reviewing the Company s Offshore Marine Services  fleet for impairment, including stacked vessels expected to return to active service, the Company groups vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics into vessel classes.  As a result of the continued weak market conditions, the Company has identified indicators of impairment for certain of its owned offshore support vessels or vessel classes.  As a consequence, the Company estimated their undiscounted future cash flows and determined that for one mini-supply vessel, one specialty vessel,   13   anchor handling towing supply vessels, eight supply vessels and   13   liftboats, there is sufficient uncertainty as to whether or not their carrying values would be recovered.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company obtained independent appraisals and other market data resulting in impairment charges of   $50.6 million   related to these identified vessels and associated intangible assets.  Due to limited market transactions, the primary valuation methodology applied by the appraisers was an estimated cost approach less estimated economic depreciation for comparably aged assets with a discount applied for economic obsolescence based on current and prior two years  performance trending. 
  The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions on expected future rates per day worked and utilization levels for vessels and vessel classes over their expected remaining lives.  Those estimates and assumptions are based on the projected magnitude and timing of a market recovery from offshore oil and gas exploration and production activity in the geographic regions where the Company operates and, as such, are highly subjective.  If difficult market conditions persist and an anticipated recovery is delayed beyond the Company s expectation, further deterioration in the fair value of vessels already impaired or revisions to management s forecasts may result in the Company recording additional impairment charges related to its long-lived assets in future periods.

Impairment of 50% or Less Owned Companies.    Investments in 50% or less owned companies are reviewed periodically to assess whether there is an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the investment.  The periodic assessment considers, among other things, whether the carrying value of the investment is able to be recovered and whether or not the investee s ability to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying value of the investment.  When the Company determines its investment in the 50% or less owned company is not recoverable or the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to fair value.  Actual results may vary from the Company s estimates due to the uncertainty regarding the projected financial performance of 50% or less owned companies, the severity and expected duration of declines in value, and the available liquidity in the capital markets to support the continuing operations of the 50% or less owned company.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a   $0.3 million   impairment charge, net of tax, related to one of Offshore Marine Services  equity method investments in equity in earnings (losses) of 50% or less owned companies in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).  In addition, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a   $6.5 million   impairment charge related to a Shipping Services  cost investment in a foreign container shipping company in other, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to its 50% or less owned companies. 
    Deferred Gains.    The Company has sold certain equipment to its 50% or less owned companies, entered into vessel sale-leaseback transactions with finance companies, and provided seller financing on sales of its equipment to third parties and its 50% or less owned companies.  A portion of the gains realized from these transactions were deferred and recorded in deferred gains and other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Deferred gain activity related to these transactions for the   nine months ended September 30   was as follows (in thousands): 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.    The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows (in thousands): 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share.    Basic earnings (loss) per common share of SEACOR is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding during the relevant periods.  Diluted earnings (loss) per common share of SEACOR is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding plus the effect of potentially dilutive securities through the application of the treasury stock and if-converted methods.  Dilutive securities for this purpose assumes restricted stock grants have vested, common shares have been issued pursuant to the exercise of outstanding stock options and common shares have been issued pursuant to the conversion of all outstanding convertible notes.

            (2) 
    For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , diluted earnings per common share of SEACOR excluded   2,382,626   common shares issuable pursuant to the Company s   2.5%   Convertible Senior Notes,   1,825,326   common shares issuable pursuant to the Company s   3.0%   Convertible Senior Notes and   2,243,500   common shares issuable pursuant to the Company s   3.75%   Subsidiary Convertible Senior Notes as the effect of their inclusion in the computation would be anti-dilutive.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , diluted earnings per common share of SEACOR excluded   2,910,688   common shares issuable pursuant to the Company s   2.5%   Convertible Senior Notes,   1,825,326   common shares issuable pursuant to the Company s   3.0%   Convertible Senior Notes and   2,243,500   common shares issuable pursuant to the Company s   3.75%   Subsidiary Convertible Senior Notes as the effect of their inclusion in the computation would be anti-dilutive. 
              (3) 
    For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , diluted earnings per common share of SEACOR excluded   4,200,525   common shares issuable pursuant to the Company s   2.5%   Convertible Senior Notes and   1,825,326   common shares issuable pursuant to the Company s   3.0%   Convertible Senior Notes as the effect of their inclusion in the computation would be anti-dilutive. 
     New Accounting Pronouncements.    On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  The core principal of the new standard is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company has not yet selected the method of adoption or determined what impact, if any, the adoption of the new standard will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued a comprehensive new leasing standard, which improves transparency and comparability among companies by requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts.  It also requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements.  The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has not yet determined what impact, if any, the adoption of the new standard will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting standards, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted.  The Company has not yet determined what impact, if any, the adoption of the new standard will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

    Included in other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, except for the exchange option liability on subsidiary convertible senior notes. 
     Fair Value Hedges.    From time to time, the Company may designate certain of its foreign currency exchange contracts as fair value hedges in respect of capital commitments denominated in foreign currencies.  By entering into these foreign currency exchange contracts, the Company may fix a portion of its capital commitments denominated in foreign currencies in U.S. dollars to protect against currency fluctuations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had euro denominated forward currency exchange contracts with an aggregate U.S. dollar equivalent of   $9.7 million   related to offshore support vessels scheduled to be delivered in 2017.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the fair value of these contracts decreased by   $0.2 million   and was included as an increase to the corresponding hedged equipment included in construction in progress in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  Cash Flow Hedges.    The Company and certain of the Company s 50% or less owned companies have interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges.  By entering into these interest rate swap agreements, these companies have converted the variable LIBOR or EURIBOR component of certain of their outstanding borrowings to a fixed interest rate.  The Company recognized losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of   $3.9 million   and   $2.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate swaps held by the Company and the Company s 50% or less owned companies were as follows: 
             
    The Company had two interest rate swap agreements maturing in   2021   that call for the Company to pay a fixed rate of interest of   (0.03)%   on the aggregate notional value of    15.0 million   (  $16.9 million  ) and receive a variable interest rate based on EURIBOR on the aggregate notional value. 
                
    MexMar had four interest rate swap agreements with maturities in   2023   that call for MexMar to pay a fixed rate of interest ranging from   1.71%   to   2.05%   on the aggregate amortized notional value of   $108.6 million   and receive a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the aggregate amortized notional value. 
                
    Sea-Cat Crewzer II had an interest rate swap agreement maturing in   2019   that calls for Sea-Cat Crewzer II to pay a fixed rate of interest of   1.52%   on the amortized notional value of   $23.9 million   and receive a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the amortized notional value. 
                
    Sea-Cat Crewzer had an interest rate swap agreement maturing in   2019   that calls for Sea-Cat Crewzer to pay a fixed rate of interest of   1.52%   on the amortized notional value of   $21.1 million   and receive a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the amortized notional value.

Other Derivative Instruments.    The Company recognized gains (losses) on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as follows (in thousands): 

The exchange option liability relates to a bifurcated embedded derivative in the Company s   3.75%   Subsidiary Convertible Senior Notes. 
  The Company holds positions in publicly traded equity options that convey the right or obligation to engage in future transactions in the underlying equity security or index.  The Company s investment in equity options primarily includes positions in energy, marine, transportation and other related businesses.  These contracts are typically entered into to mitigate the risk of changes in the market value of marketable security positions that the Company is either about to acquire, has acquired or is about to dispose. 
  The Company enters and settles forward currency exchange, option and future contracts with respect to various foreign currencies.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding forward currency exchange contracts translated into a net purchase of foreign currencies with an aggregate U.S. dollar equivalent of   $2.1 million  .  These contracts enable the Company to buy currencies in the future at fixed exchange rates, which could offset possible consequences of changes in currency exchange rates with respect to the Company s business conducted outside of the United States.  The Company generally does not enter into contracts with forward settlement dates beyond twelve to eighteen months. 
  The Company and certain of its 50% or less owned companies have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the general purpose of providing protection against increases in interest rates, which might lead to higher interest costs.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate swaps held by the Company or its 50% or less owned companies were as follows: 
             
    OSV Partners had two interest rate swap agreements with maturities in   2020   that call for OSV Partners to pay a fixed rate of interest ranging from   1.89%   to   2.27%   on the aggregate amortized notional value of   $39.3 million   and receive a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the aggregate amortized notional value. 
                
    Dynamic Offshore had an interest rate swap agreement maturing in   2018   that calls for Dynamic Offshore to pay a fixed interest rate of   1.30%   on the amortized notional value of   $76.4 million   and receive a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the amortized notional value. 
                
    Falcon Global had an interest rate swap agreement maturing in   2022   that calls for Falcon Global to pay a fixed interest rate of   2.06%   on the amortized notional value of   $62.5 million   and receive a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the amortized notional value. 
     The Company and certain of its 50% or less owned companies enter and settle positions in various exchange and non-exchange traded commodity swap, option and future contracts.  ICP enters into exchange traded positions (primarily corn, ethanol and natural gas) to protect its raw material and finished goods inventory balances from market changes.  VA E enters into exchange traded positions to protect its fixed price future purchase and sale contracts for sugar as well as its inventory balances from market changes.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the net market exposure to these commodities under these contracts was not material.

    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
     The fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value and defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.    Level 1   inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.    Level 2   inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included in   Level 1   that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs derived from observable market data.    Level 3   inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
  The Company s financial assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in thousands):

______________________ 
   Level 3 Inputs.    The fair value of the exchange option liability on subsidiary convertible senior notes is estimated with significant inputs that are both observable and unobservable in the market and therefore is considered a   Level 3   fair value measurement.  Observable inputs include market quotes, current interest rates, benchmark yield curves, volatility, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and historical dividends.  The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement is the probability assessment of a SMH Spin-off.  In the fair value measurement, holding the observable inputs constant, a significant increase in the probability of a SMH Spin-off would result in a significantly lower exchange option liability. 
  The estimated fair values of the Company s other financial assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands): 
   
 ______________________ 
           (1) 
    The estimated fair value includes the embedded conversion options on the Company s   2.5%   and   3.0%   Convertible Senior Notes. 
     The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash approximates fair value.  The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was estimated based upon quoted market prices or by using discounted cash flow analyses based on estimated current rates for similar types of arrangements.  It was not practicable to estimate the fair value of certain of the Company s investments, at cost, in 50% or less owned companies because of the lack of quoted market prices and the inability to estimate fair value without incurring excessive costs.  It was not practicable to estimate the fair value of the Company s notes receivable

from third parties as the overall returns are uncertain due to certain provisions for additional payments contingent upon future events.  Considerable judgment was required in developing certain of the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. 
  The Company s other assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands): 

______________________ 
           (1) 
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized impairment charges of   $51.7 million     associated with certain Offshore Marine Services  offshore support vessels (see Note 1) and certain Inland River Services  equipment currently under construction.  The fair value of two offshore support vessels were determined based on the contracted sales prices of the vessels.  The fair value of the equipment under construction was determined based on scrap steel value.  The fair value of the remaining offshore support vessels were determined based on third-party valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and therefore are considered a   Lev  el 3 fair value measurement.  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement were the construction costs of similar new equipment and estimated economic depreciation for comparably aged assets with a discount applied for economic obsolescence based on current and prior two years  performance trending. 
              (2) 
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company identified indicators of impairment in a Shipping Services  cost investment in a foreign container shipping company and, as a consequence, recognized an impairment charge of   $6.5 million   for an other-than-temporary decline in fair value.  The fair value was based on the value of the common stock issued in a recent offering. 
              (3) 
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company identified indicators of impairment in one of Offshore Marine Services  equity method investments as a result of continuing weak market conditions and, as a consequence, recognized a   $0.3 million   impairment charge, net of tax, for an other-than-temporary decline in fair value.  The investment was determined to have no value and the Company has suspended equity method accounting. 
              (4) 
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a   $6.7 million   reserve for one of its notes receivable from third parties following a decline in the underlying collateral value.  The collateral was determined to have no value.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
     The Company's capital commitments as of   September 30, 2016   by year of expected payment were as follows (in thousands): 

Offshore Marine Services' capital commitments included   nine   fast support vessels,   four   supply vessels and   one   wind farm utility vessel.  These commitments included   $15.4 million   for   one   supply vessel that may be assumed by a third party at their option.  Shipping Services  capital commitments included   two   U.S.-flag product tankers,   one   U.S.-flag chemical and petroleum articulated tug-barge and   two   U.S.-flag harbor tugs and other equipment and upgrades.

  On December 15, 2010, both ORM and NRC, a subsidiary of the Company prior to the SES Business Transaction were named as defendants in   one   of the several  master complaints  filed in the overall multi-district litigation relating to the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response and clean-up in the Gulf of Mexico pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (the  MDL ).  The  B3  master complaint naming ORM and NRC asserts various claims on behalf of a putative class against multiple defendants concerning the clean-up activities generally and the use of dispersants specifically.  Both prior to and following the filing of the aforementioned master complaint, individual civil actions naming the Company, ORM, and/or NRC alleging B3 exposure-based injuries and/or damages were consolidated with the MDL and stayed pursuant to court order, discussed in turn below.  The Company has continually taken the position that all of the B3 claims asserted against ORM and NRC have no merit, and on February 28, 2011, ORM and NRC moved to dismiss all claims asserted against them in the master complaint.  On September 30, 2011, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss that ORM and NRC had filed, although the Court recognized the validity of the derivative immunity and implied preemption arguments that ORM and NRC advanced in their motion and directed ORM and NRC to (i) conduct limited discovery to develop evidence to support those arguments and (ii) then re-assert those arguments.  A schedule for limited discovery and motion practice was established by the Court and, in accordance with that schedule, ORM and NRC filed for summary judgment re-asserting their immunity and preemption arguments on May 18, 2012.  Those motions were argued on July 13, 2012 and taken under advisement.  On July 17, 2014, the Court issued a pretrial order that established a protocol for disclosures clarifying the basis for the B3 claims asserted against the Clean-Up Responder Defendants, including ORM and NRC, in the MDL, whether by joinder in the master complaint, individual complaint or otherwise.  Under this protocol, plaintiffs who satisfied certain criteria and believed they had specific evidence in support of their claims, including that any Clean-Up Responder Defendant(s) failed to act pursuant to the authority and direction of the federal government in conducting   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill remediation and clean-up operations, had to submit a sworn statement or face dismissal.  Plaintiffs  deadline to serve such sworn statements in support of their claims was September 22, 2014, with the exception of several Plaintiffs who were granted an extension until October 10, 2014.  On November 14, 2014, the Clean-Up Responder Defendants and the Plaintiffs  Steering Committee ( PSC ) in the MDL submitted a joint report to the Court regarding claimants  compliance with the pretrial order.  In this joint report, the parties (i) explained how they complied with the notice requirements of the Court s July 17, 2014 pretrial order, (ii) noted that they had received 102 sworn statements in connection with this pretrial order, and (iii) provided the Court with an assessment of the sworn statements received.  An additional sworn statement was received after the joint report was submitted.  On January 7, 2016, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause ( OSC ) as to the B3 claims against the Clean-Up Responder Defendants, including ORM and NRC.  The OSC ordered any plaintiff(s) opposed to the Court entering the proposed Order   Reasons ( O R ) attached to the OSC to show cause, in writing, on or before January 28, 2016 why the Court should not dismiss their B3 claim(s) with prejudice for the reasons set forth in the O R.  The O R addressed the pending summary judgment motions and stated, among other things, why the Clean-Up Responder Defendants are entitled to derivative immunity under the Clean Water Act and discretionary function immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and why Plaintiffs  claims are preempted by the implied conflict preemption doctrine.  The O R also discussed the results of the protocol delineated in the Court s July 17, 2014 pretrial order and concluded with the dismissal of all but   eleven   Plaintiffs  B3 claims against the Clean-Up Responder Defendants with prejudice.  Eight individual Plaintiffs submitted responses to the OSC by the January 28, 2016 deadline, and the Clean-Up Responder Defendants submitted a response thereto on February 4, 2016.  On February 16, 2016, the Court issued an order overruling the objections relayed in the eight individual Plaintiffs  responses to the OSC, and then entered a dismissal order nearly identical to the O R.  Accordingly, the final Order   Reasons entered on February 16, 2016 dismissed all but   eleven   B3 claims against ORM and NRC with prejudice, whether by joinder in the master complaint, individual complaint,

or otherwise (the  B3 Dismissal Order ).  The deadline for Plaintiffs to appeal the B3 Dismissal Order has passed and the Company continues to evaluate how this ruling will impact the individual civil actions.  Moreover, on April 8, 2016, the Court entered an order establishing a summary judgment briefing schedule as to the remaining   eleven   B3 claimants (the  Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs ).  The Clean-Up Responder Defendants, including ORM and NRC, filed an omnibus motion for summary judgment as to the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs on May 9, 2016.  Following briefing by the parties, on August 2, 2016, the Court granted the omnibus motion as it concerns ORM and NRC in its entirety, dismissing the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  against ORM and NRC with prejudice (the  Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order ).  To date, no appeal has been filed.  In addition to the indemnity provided to ORM, pursuant to contractual agreements with the responsible party, the responsible party has agreed, subject to certain potential limitations, to indemnify and defend ORM and NRC in connection with the B3 claims in the MDL.  Although the Company is unable to estimate the potential exposure, if any, resulting from the remaining B3 claims, the Company does not expect they will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  As noted above, various civil actions concerning the   Deepwater Horizon   clean-up have been consolidated with the MDL and stayed.  However, as discussed further below, the individual B3 exposure-based claims asserted against ORM and/or NRC have been dismissed pursuant to the B3 Dismissal Order or the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order.  On July 20, 2010, two individuals purporting to represent a class commenced a civil action in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans in the State of Louisiana,   John Wunstell, Jr. and Kelly Blanchard v. BP, et al.  , No. 2010-7437 (Division K) (the    Wunstell   Action ), in which they assert, among other theories, that Mr. Wunstell suffered injuries as a result of his exposure to certain noxious fumes and chemicals in connection with the provision of remediation, containment, and response services by ORM during the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response and clean-up in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  Mr. Wunstell is one of the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs and his claim was dismissed by virtue of the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order; Ms. Blanchard s B3 claim against ORM was dismissed by virtue of the B3 Dismissal Order.  On April 8, 2011, ORM was named as a defendant in   Johnson Bros. Corporation of Louisiana v. BP, PLC, et al.  , No. 2:11-CV-00781 (E.D. La.), which is a suit by an individual business seeking damages allegedly caused by a delay on a construction project alleged to have resulted from the clean-up operations.  On April 15, 2011, ORM and NRC were named as defendants in   Thomas Edward Black v. BP Exploration, et al.  , No. 2:11-CV-00867 (E.D. La.) (the    Black   Action ), which is a suit by an individual who is seeking damages for, among other things, lost income because he allegedly could not find work in the fishing industry after the oil spill and exposure during the spill.  The B3 exposure claims against ORM and NRC in the   Black   Action have been dismissed by virtue of the B3 Dismissal Order.  On October 3, 2012, ORM and NRC were served with a Rule 14(c) Third-Party Complaint by Jambon Supplier II, L.L.C. and Jambon Marine Holdings L.L.C. in their Limitation of Liability action, In the Matter of   Jambon Supplier II, L.L.C., et al.  , No. 2:12-CV-00426 (E.D. La.).  This Third-Party Complaint alleges that if claimant David Dinwiddie, who served as a clean-up crewmember aboard the   M/V JAMBON SUPPLIER     II   vessel during the clean-up efforts, was injured as a result of his exposure to dispersants and chemicals during the course and scope of his employment, then said injuries were caused by the third-party defendants.  On November 25, 2012, ORM was named as a defendant in   Victoria Sanchez v. American Pollution Control Corp. et al.  , No. 2:12-CV-00164 (E.D. La.), a maritime suit filed by an individual who allegedly participated in the clean-up effort and sustained personal injuries during the course of such employment.  Ms. Sanchez s B3 claim against ORM has been dismissed by virtue of the B3 Dismissal Order.  On December 17, 2012, the Court unsealed a False Claims Act lawsuit naming ORM as a defendant,   Dillon v. BP, PLC et al.  , No. 2:12-CV-00987 (E.D. La.), which is a suit by an individual seeking damages and penalties arising from alleged false reports and claims made to the federal government with respect to the amount of oil burned and dispersed during the clean-up.  The federal government has declined to intervene in this suit.  On April 8, 2013, the Company, ORM, and NRC were named as defendants in   William and Dianna Fitzgerald v. BP Exploration et al.  , No. 2:13-CV-00650 (E.D. La.) (the    Fitzgerald   Action ), which is a suit by a husband and wife whose son allegedly participated in the clean-up effort and became ill as a result of his exposure to oil and dispersants.  While the decedent in the   Fitzgerald   Action s claims against ORM and NRC were dismisses by virtue of the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order, the claim as against the Company remains stayed.  Finally, on April 17, 2013, ORM was named as a defendant in   Danos et al. v. BP America Production Co. et al.  , No. 2:13-CV-03747 (removed to E.D. La.) (the    Danos   Action ), which is a suit by eight individuals seeking damages for dispersant exposure either as a result of their work during clean-up operations or as a result of their residence in the Gulf.  The claims asserted by Messrs. Jorey Danos and Frank Howell, two plaintiffs in the   Danos   Action were dismissed by virtue of the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order; the other   Danos   Action plaintiffs  B3 claims against ORM were previously dismissed by virtue of the B3 Dismissal Order.  The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the B3 Dismissal Order, the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order, and other developments in the MDL, including the settlements discussed below, on these individual actions.  The Company is unable to estimate the potential exposure, if any, resulting from these matters, to the extent they remain viable, but believes they are without merit and does not expect that they will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On February 18, 2011, Triton Asset Leasing GmbH, Transocean Holdings LLC, Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc., and Transocean Deepwater Inc. (collectively  Transocean ) named ORM and NRC as third-party defendants in a Rule 14(c) Third-Party Complaint in Transocean's own Limitation of Liability Act action, which is part of the overall MDL, tendering to ORM and NRC the claims in the referenced master complaint that have already been asserted against ORM and NRC.  Transocean, Cameron International Corporation ( Cameron ), Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., and M-I L.L.C. ( M-I ) also filed cross-claims against ORM and NRC for contribution and tort indemnity should they be found liable for any damages in Transocean's Limitation of Liability Act action and ORM and NRC asserted counterclaims against those same parties for identical relief.  The remainder of the aforementioned cross-claims in Transocean's limitation action remain pending, although the Court has found Cameron and M-I to be not liable in connection with the   Deepwater Horizon   incident and resultant oil spill and dismissed these parties from the MDL.  As indicated above, the Company is unable to estimate the potential exposure, if any, resulting from these actions but believes they are without merit and does not expect that these matters will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  On November 16, 2012,   668   individuals who served as beach clean-up workers in Escambia County, Florida during the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response commenced a civil action in the Circuit Court for the First Judicial Circuit of Florida, in and for Escambia County,   Abney et al. v. Plant Performance Services, LLC et al.  , No. 2012-CA-002947, in which they allege, among other things, that ORM and other defendants engaged in the contamination of Florida waters and beaches in violation of Florida Statutes Chapter 376 and injured the Plaintiffs by exposing them to dispersants during the course and scope of their employment.  This case was removed to federal court and ultimately consolidated with the MDL on April 2, 2013.  On April 22, 2013, a companion case to this matter was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida,   Abood et al. v. Plant Performance Services, LLC et al.  , No. 3:13-CV-00284 (N.D. Fla.), which alleges identical allegations against the same parties but names an additional   174   Plaintiffs, all of whom served as clean-up workers in various Florida counties during the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response.  This case was consolidated with the MDL on May 10, 2013.  By court order, both of these matters have been stayed since they were consolidated with the MDL.  The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the developments in the MDL, including the settlements discussed below, on these cases, but believes that the potential exposure, if any, resulting from these matters has been reduced as a result of the B3 Dismissal Order and does not expect that these matters will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Separately, on March 2, 2012, the Court announced that BP Exploration and BP America Production Company ( BP America ) (collectively  BP ) and the Plaintiffs had reached an agreement on the terms of two proposed class action settlements that will resolve, among other things, Plaintiffs  economic loss claims and clean-up related claims against BP.  Both settlements were granted final approval by the Court, all appeals have concluded, and the deadline for submitting claims with respect to both settlements has passed.  Although neither the Company, ORM, nor NRC are parties to the settlement agreements, the Company, ORM, and NRC are listed as released parties on the releases accompanying both settlement agreements.  Consequently, class members who did not file timely requests for exclusion will be barred from pursuing economic loss, property damage, personal injury, medical monitoring, and/or other released claims against the Company, ORM, and NRC.  The Company believes these settlements have reduced the potential exposure, if any, from some of the pending actions described above, and continues to evaluate the settlements  impacts on these cases. 
  In the course of the Company s business, it may agree to indemnify the counterparty to an agreement.  If the indemnified party makes a successful claim for indemnification, the Company would be required to reimburse that party in accordance with the terms of the indemnification agreement.  Indemnification agreements generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. 
  In connection with the SES Business Transaction, the Company remains contingently liable for certain obligations, including potential liabilities relating to work performed in connection with the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response.  Pursuant to the agreement governing the sale, the Company s potential liability to the purchaser may not exceed the consideration received by the Company for the SES Business Transaction.  The Company is currently indemnified under contractual agreements with BP for the potential liabilities relating to work performed in connection with the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response. 
  In the normal course of its business, the Company becomes involved in various other litigation matters including, among other things, claims by third parties for alleged property damages and personal injuries.  Management has used estimates in determining the Company s potential exposure to these matters and has recorded reserves in its financial statements related thereto where appropriate.  It is possible that a change in the Company s estimates of that exposure could occur, but the Company does not expect such changes in estimated costs would have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The number of days available for charter were 8,626 in the Current Year Quarter compared with 8,788 in the Prior Year Quarter, a 162 day or 2% reduction. 
  In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, time charter revenues were $22.8 million lower in the Current Year Quarter compared with the Prior Year Quarter primarily due to a $16.1 million reduction from anchor handling towing supply vessels, a $5.4 million reduction from the liftboat fleet and a $1.3 million reduction from the fast support vessels.  Time charter revenues were $22.5 million lower due to reduced utilization, of which $20.5 million was a consequence of cold-stacking vessels, and $0.6 million lower due to a decrease in average day rates.  Time charter revenues were $0.3 million higher due to net fleet additions.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 37 of 45 owned and leased-in vessels cold-stacked in this region compared with 19 of 36 as of September 30, 2015.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the cold-stacked vessels consisted of ten anchor handling towing supply vessels, 13 fast support vessels, two supply vessels and twelve liftboats.  As of   September 30, 2015  , the cold-stacked vessels consisted of five anchor handling towing supply vessels, two fast support vessels, four supply vessels and eight liftboats. 
  In Africa, time charter revenues were $3.7 million lower in the Current Year Quarter compared with the Prior Year Quarter.  Time charter revenues were $2.2 million lower due to reduced utilization, of which $1.6 million was a consequence of cold-stacking vessels, $1.4 million lower due to a decrease in average day rates and $0.1 million lower due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the cold-stacked vessels consisted of one anchor handling towing supply vessel, two fast support vessels and one mini-supply vessel.  As of   September 30, 2015  , the cold-stacked vessels consisted of two fast support vessels. 
  In the Middle East, time charter revenues were $0.3 million higher in the Current Year Quarter compared with the Prior Year Quarter.  Time charter revenues were $0.7 million higher due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions and $0.6 million higher due to net fleet additions.  Time charter revenues were $0.9 million lower due to a decrease in average day rates and $0.1 million lower due to reduced utilization. 
  In Brazil, Mexico, Central and South America, time charter revenues were $3.7 million lower in the Current Year Quarter compared with the Prior Year Quarter due to the change in contract status for two vessels from time charter to bareboat charter during the first quarter of 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had two of four owned and leased-in vessels cold-stacked in the region compared with none of six as of September 30, 2015.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the cold-stacked vessels consisted of one fast support vessel and one supply vessel. 
  In Europe, excluding wind farm utility vessels, time charter revenues were $5.7 million lower in the Current Year Quarter compared with the Prior Year Quarter.  Time charter revenues were $0.3 million lower due to reduced utilization, $0.4 million lower due to reduced average day rates, $2.6 million lower due to fleet dispositions and $2.4 million lower due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.  For the wind farm utility vessels, time charter revenues were $0.6 million lower.  Time charter revenues were $0.1 million lower due to reduced utilization, $0.1 million lower due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions and $1.0 million lower due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.  Time charter revenues were $0.4 million higher due to an increase in average day rates and $0.2 million higher due to fleet additions. 
  In Asia, time charter revenues were $1.2 million lower in the Current Year Quarter compared with the Prior Year Quarter.  Time charter revenues were $1.3 million lower due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions and $0.1 million higher due to an increase in average day rates.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had none of one owned vessel cold-stacked in the region compared with one of four as of September 30, 2015.  As of   September 30, 2015  , one anchor handling towing supply vessel was cold-stacked. 
  Other operating revenues were $4.0 million lower in the Current Year Quarter compared with the Prior Year Quarter primarily due to a reduction in other marine services revenue associated with decreased activity levels. 
    Operating Expenses.    Operating expenses were $29.1 million lower in the Current Year Quarter compared with the Prior Year Quarter.  On an overall basis, operating expenses were $3.0 million lower due to net fleet dispositions, $9.4 million lower due to the effect of cold-stacking vessels, $7.2 million lower for vessels in active service, $1.1 million lower due to the change in contract status for two vessels from time charter to bareboat charter during the first quarter of 2016, $1.5 million lower due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions and other changes in fleet mix and $6.9 million lower due to the Prior Year Quarter recognition of charge for a U.K. subsidiary s share of a funding deficit in the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund ( MNRPF ) for North Sea mariners arising from a 2014 actuarial valuation.

     Table of Contents  

Personnel costs were $1.0 million lower due to net fleet dispositions, $7.2 million lower due to the effect of cold-stacking vessels, $3.3 million lower for vessels in active service primarily due to favorable changes in currency exchange rates partially offset by increased seafarer compensation costs, $1.0 million lower due to the change in contract status for two vessels from time charter to bareboat charter during the first quarter of 2016, $0.3 million lower due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions and other changes in fleet mix and $6.9 million lower due to the above referenced recognition of a charge for a U.K subsidiary s share of a funding deficit in the MNRPF. 
    Administrative and General.    Administrative and general expenses were $2.2 million lower in the Current Year Quarter compared with the Prior Year Quarter primarily due to a reduction in shore side personnel costs. 
    Losses on Asset Dispositions and Impairments, net.    During the Current Year Quarter, the Company sold four offshore support vessels and other equipment for net proceeds of $2.2 million and an immaterial gain.  In addition, the Company recorded impairment charges of $29.2 million primarily related to the anchor handling towing supply fleet and one specialty vessel.  During the Prior Year Quarter, the Company recognized impairment charges of $0.2 million related to other marine equipment spares. 
    Operating Loss.    Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on asset dispositions and impairments, net, operating loss as a percentage of operating revenues was 22% in the Current Year Quarter compared with 3% in the Prior Year Quarter primarily due to weaker market conditions. 
  Current Nine Months compared with Prior Nine Months

    To the extent a SMH Spin-off does not occur prior to December 1, 2017, the holders of the 3.75% Subsidiary Convertible Senior Notes may require us to purchase for cash all or part of the notes at par on that date; however, if the SMH Spin-off is consummated, this put option of $175.0 million would immediately terminate.

       Short and Long-Term Liquidity Requirements 
  The Company anticipates it will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations and that these cash flows will be adequate to meet the Company s working capital requirements.  In support of the Company s capital expenditure program and debt service requirements, the Company believes that a combination of cash balances on hand, cash generated from operating activities, funding under existing subsidiary financing arrangements and access to the credit and capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations.  The Company continually evaluates possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets.  The Company s sources of liquidity may be impacted by the general condition of the markets in which it operates and the broader economy as a whole, which may limit its access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms.  Management will continue to closely monitor the Company s liquidity and the credit and capital markets.

Contingencies 
  On December 15, 2010, both ORM and NRC, a subsidiary of the Company prior to the SES Business Transaction were named as defendants in   one   of the several  master complaints  filed in the overall multi-district litigation relating to the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response and clean-up in the Gulf of Mexico pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (the  MDL ).  The  B3  master complaint naming ORM and NRC asserts various claims on behalf of a putative class against multiple defendants concerning the clean-up activities generally and the use of dispersants specifically.  Both prior to and following the filing of the aforementioned master complaint, individual civil actions naming the Company, ORM, and/or NRC alleging B3 exposure-based injuries and/or damages were consolidated with the MDL and stayed pursuant to court order, discussed in turn below.  The Company has continually taken the position that all of the B3 claims asserted against ORM and NRC have no merit, and on February 28, 2011, ORM and NRC moved to dismiss all claims asserted against them in the master complaint.  On September 30, 2011, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss that ORM and NRC had filed, although the Court recognized the validity of the derivative immunity and implied preemption arguments that ORM and NRC advanced in their motion and directed ORM and NRC to (i) conduct limited discovery to develop evidence to support those arguments and (ii) then re-assert those arguments.  A schedule for limited discovery and motion practice was established by the Court and, in accordance with that schedule, ORM and NRC filed for summary judgment re-asserting their immunity and preemption arguments on May 18, 2012.  Those motions were argued on July 13, 2012 and taken under advisement.  On July 17, 2014, the Court issued a pretrial order that established a protocol for disclosures clarifying the basis for the B3 claims asserted against the Clean-Up Responder Defendants, including ORM and NRC, in the MDL, whether by joinder in the master complaint, individual complaint or otherwise.  Under this protocol, plaintiffs who satisfied certain criteria and believed they had specific evidence in support of their claims, including that any Clean-Up Responder Defendant(s) failed to act pursuant to the authority and direction of the federal government in conducting   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill remediation and clean-up operations, had to submit a sworn statement or face dismissal.  Plaintiffs  deadline to serve such sworn statements in support of their claims was September 22, 2014, with the exception of several Plaintiffs who were granted an extension until October 10, 2014.  On November 14, 2014, the Clean-Up Responder Defendants and the Plaintiffs  Steering Committee ( PSC ) in the MDL submitted a joint report to the Court regarding claimants  compliance with the pretrial order.  In this joint report, the parties (i) explained how they complied with the notice requirements of the Court s July 17, 2014 pretrial order, (ii) noted that they had received 102 sworn statements in connection with this pretrial order, and (iii) provided the Court with an assessment of the sworn statements received.  An additional sworn statement was received after the joint report was submitted.  On January 7, 2016, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause ( OSC ) as to the B3 claims against the Clean-Up Responder Defendants, including ORM and NRC.  The OSC ordered any plaintiff(s) opposed to the Court entering the proposed Order   Reasons ( O R ) attached to the OSC to show cause, in writing, on or before January 28, 2016 why the Court should not dismiss their B3 claim(s) with prejudice for the reasons set forth in the O R.  The O R addressed the pending summary judgment motions and stated, among other things, why the Clean-Up Responder Defendants are entitled to derivative immunity under the Clean Water Act and discretionary function immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and why Plaintiffs  claims are preempted by the implied conflict preemption doctrine.  The O R also discussed the results of the protocol delineated in the Court s July 17, 2014 pretrial order and concluded with the dismissal of all but   eleven   Plaintiffs  B3 claims against the Clean-Up Responder Defendants with prejudice.  Eight individual Plaintiffs submitted responses to the OSC by the January 28, 2016 deadline, and the Clean-Up Responder Defendants submitted a response thereto on February 4, 2016.  On February 16, 2016, the Court issued an order overruling the objections relayed in the eight individual Plaintiffs  responses to the OSC, and then entered a dismissal order nearly identical to the O R.  Accordingly, the final Order   Reasons entered on February 16, 2016 dismissed all but   eleven   B3 claims against ORM and NRC with prejudice, whether by joinder in the master complaint, individual complaint, or otherwise (the  B3 Dismissal Order ).  The deadline for Plaintiffs to appeal the B3 Dismissal Order has passed and the Company continues to evaluate how this ruling will impact the individual civil actions.  Moreover, on April 8, 2016, the Court entered an order establishing a summary judgment briefing schedule as to the remaining   eleven   B3 claimants (the  Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs ).  The Clean-Up Responder Defendants, including ORM and NRC, filed an omnibus motion for summary judgment as to the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs on May 9, 2016.  Following briefing by the parties, on August 2, 2016, the Court granted the omnibus motion as it concerns ORM and NRC in its entirety, dismissing the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  against ORM and NRC with prejudice (the  Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order ).  To date, no appeal has been filed.  In addition to the indemnity provided to ORM, pursuant to contractual agreements with the responsible party, the responsible party has agreed, subject to certain potential limitations, to indemnify and defend ORM and NRC in connection with the B3 claims in the MDL.  Although the Company is unable to estimate the potential exposure, if any, resulting from the remaining B3 claims, the Company does not expect they will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  As noted above, various civil actions concerning the   Deepwater Horizon   clean-up have been consolidated with the MDL and stayed.  However, as discussed further below, the individual B3 exposure-based claims asserted against ORM and/or NRC have been dismissed pursuant to the B3 Dismissal Order or the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order.  On July 20, 2010, two individuals purporting to represent a class commenced a civil action in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans in the State of Louisiana,   John Wunstell, Jr. and Kelly Blanchard v. BP, et al.  , No. 2010-7437 (Division K) (the    Wunstell   Action ), in which they assert, among other theories, that Mr. Wunstell suffered injuries as a result of his exposure to certain noxious fumes  
  
   44 

     Table of Contents  

and chemicals in connection with the provision of remediation, containment, and response services by ORM during the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response and clean-up in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  Mr. Wunstell is one of the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs and his claim was dismissed by virtue of the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order; Ms. Blanchard s B3 claim against ORM was dismissed by virtue of the B3 Dismissal Order.  On April 8, 2011, ORM was named as a defendant in   Johnson Bros. Corporation of Louisiana v. BP, PLC, et al.  , No. 2:11-CV-00781 (E.D. La.), which is a suit by an individual business seeking damages allegedly caused by a delay on a construction project alleged to have resulted from the clean-up operations.  On April 15, 2011, ORM and NRC were named as defendants in   Thomas Edward Black v. BP Exploration, et al.  , No. 2:11-CV-00867 (E.D. La.) (the    Black   Action ), which is a suit by an individual who is seeking damages for, among other things, lost income because he allegedly could not find work in the fishing industry after the oil spill and exposure during the spill.  The B3 exposure claims against ORM and NRC in the   Black   Action have been dismissed by virtue of the B3 Dismissal Order.  On October 3, 2012, ORM and NRC were served with a Rule 14(c) Third-Party Complaint by Jambon Supplier II, L.L.C. and Jambon Marine Holdings L.L.C. in their Limitation of Liability action, In the Matter of   Jambon Supplier II, L.L.C., et al.  , No. 2:12-CV-00426 (E.D. La.).  This Third-Party Complaint alleges that if claimant David Dinwiddie, who served as a clean-up crewmember aboard the   M/V JAMBON SUPPLIER     II   vessel during the clean-up efforts, was injured as a result of his exposure to dispersants and chemicals during the course and scope of his employment, then said injuries were caused by the third-party defendants.  On November 25, 2012, ORM was named as a defendant in   Victoria Sanchez v. American Pollution Control Corp. et al.  , No. 2:12-CV-00164 (E.D. La.), a maritime suit filed by an individual who allegedly participated in the clean-up effort and sustained personal injuries during the course of such employment.  Ms. Sanchez s B3 claim against ORM has been dismissed by virtue of the B3 Dismissal Order.  On December 17, 2012, the Court unsealed a False Claims Act lawsuit naming ORM as a defendant,   Dillon v. BP, PLC et al.  , No. 2:12-CV-00987 (E.D. La.), which is a suit by an individual seeking damages and penalties arising from alleged false reports and claims made to the federal government with respect to the amount of oil burned and dispersed during the clean-up.  The federal government has declined to intervene in this suit.  On April 8, 2013, the Company, ORM, and NRC were named as defendants in   William and Dianna Fitzgerald v. BP Exploration et al.  , No. 2:13-CV-00650 (E.D. La.) (the    Fitzgerald   Action ), which is a suit by a husband and wife whose son allegedly participated in the clean-up effort and became ill as a result of his exposure to oil and dispersants.  While the decedent in the   Fitzgerald   Action s claims against ORM and NRC were dismisses by virtue of the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order, the claim as against the Company remains stayed.  Finally, on April 17, 2013, ORM was named as a defendant in   Danos et al. v. BP America Production Co. et al.  , No. 2:13-CV-03747 (removed to E.D. La.) (the    Danos   Action ), which is a suit by eight individuals seeking damages for dispersant exposure either as a result of their work during clean-up operations or as a result of their residence in the Gulf.  The claims asserted by Messrs. Jorey Danos and Frank Howell, two plaintiffs in the   Danos   Action were dismissed by virtue of the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order; the other   Danos   Action plaintiffs  B3 claims against ORM were previously dismissed by virtue of the B3 Dismissal Order.  The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the B3 Dismissal Order, the Remaining Eleven Plaintiffs  Dismissal Order, and other developments in the MDL, including the settlements discussed below, on these individual actions.  The Company is unable to estimate the potential exposure, if any, resulting from these matters, to the extent they remain viable, but believes they are without merit and does not expect that they will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  On February 18, 2011, Triton Asset Leasing GmbH, Transocean Holdings LLC, Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc., and Transocean Deepwater Inc. (collectively  Transocean ) named ORM and NRC as third-party defendants in a Rule 14(c) Third-Party Complaint in Transocean's own Limitation of Liability Act action, which is part of the overall MDL, tendering to ORM and NRC the claims in the referenced master complaint that have already been asserted against ORM and NRC.  Transocean, Cameron International Corporation ( Cameron ), Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., and M-I L.L.C. ( M-I ) also filed cross-claims against ORM and NRC for contribution and tort indemnity should they be found liable for any damages in Transocean's Limitation of Liability Act action and ORM and NRC asserted counterclaims against those same parties for identical relief.  The remainder of the aforementioned cross-claims in Transocean's limitation action remain pending, although the Court has found Cameron and M-I to be not liable in connection with the   Deepwater Horizon   incident and resultant oil spill and dismissed these parties from the MDL.  As indicated above, the Company is unable to estimate the potential exposure, if any, resulting from these actions but believes they are without merit and does not expect that these matters will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  On November 16, 2012,   668   individuals who served as beach clean-up workers in Escambia County, Florida during the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response commenced a civil action in the Circuit Court for the First Judicial Circuit of Florida, in and for Escambia County,   Abney et al. v. Plant Performance Services, LLC et al.  , No. 2012-CA-002947, in which they allege, among other things, that ORM and other defendants engaged in the contamination of Florida waters and beaches in violation of Florida Statutes Chapter 376 and injured the Plaintiffs by exposing them to dispersants during the course and scope of their employment.  This case was removed to federal court and ultimately consolidated with the MDL on April 2, 2013.  On April 22, 2013, a companion case to this matter was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida,   Abood et al. v. Plant Performance Services, LLC et al.  , No. 3:13-CV-00284 (N.D. Fla.), which alleges identical allegations against the same parties but names an additional   174   Plaintiffs, all of whom served as clean-up workers in various Florida counties during the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response.  This case was consolidated with the MDL on May 10, 2013.  By court order, both of these matters have been stayed since they were consolidated with the MDL.  The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the developments in the MDL,

including the settlements discussed below, on these cases, but believes that the potential exposure, if any, resulting from these matters has been reduced as a result of the B3 Dismissal Order and does not expect that these matters will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Separately, on March 2, 2012, the Court announced that BP Exploration and BP America Production Company ( BP America ) (collectively  BP ) and the Plaintiffs had reached an agreement on the terms of two proposed class action settlements that will resolve, among other things, Plaintiffs  economic loss claims and clean-up related claims against BP.  Both settlements were granted final approval by the Court, all appeals have concluded, and the deadline for submitting claims with respect to both settlements has passed.  Although neither the Company, ORM, nor NRC are parties to the settlement agreements, the Company, ORM, and NRC are listed as released parties on the releases accompanying both settlement agreements.  Consequently, class members who did not file timely requests for exclusion will be barred from pursuing economic loss, property damage, personal injury, medical monitoring, and/or other released claims against the Company, ORM, and NRC.  The Company believes these settlements have reduced the potential exposure, if any, from some of the pending actions described above, and continues to evaluate the settlements  impacts on these cases. 
  In the course of the Company s business, it may agree to indemnify the counterparty to an agreement.  If the indemnified party makes a successful claim for indemnification, the Company would be required to reimburse that party in accordance with the terms of the indemnification agreement.  Indemnification agreements generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. 
  In connection with the SES Business Transaction, the Company remains contingently liable for certain obligations, including potential liabilities relating to work performed in connection with the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response.  Pursuant to the agreement governing the sale, the Company s potential liability to the purchaser may not exceed the consideration received by the Company for the SES Business Transaction.  The Company is currently indemnified under contractual agreements with BP for the potential liabilities relating to work performed in connection with the   Deepwater Horizon   oil spill response. 
  In the normal course of its business, the Company becomes involved in various other litigation matters including, among other things, claims by third parties for alleged property damages and personal injuries.  Management has used estimates in determining the Company s potential exposure to these matters and has recorded reserves in its financial statements related thereto where appropriate.  It is possible that a change in the Company s estimates of that exposure could occur, but the Company does not expect such changes in estimated costs would have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
           ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       For a discussion of the Company s exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  There has been no material change in the Company s exposure to market risk during the   Current Nine Months  . 
   
           ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  With the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on their evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only a level of reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
