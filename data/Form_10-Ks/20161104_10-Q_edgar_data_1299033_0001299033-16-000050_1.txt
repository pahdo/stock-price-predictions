  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(1)    Organization and Description of Business 
  Calamos Asset Management, Inc.   ( CAM ),   representing the public shares outstanding, as of   September 30, 2016  , owned   22.2%   of the operating company, Calamos Investments LLC   ( Calamos Investments ),   with the remaining   77.8%   privately owned by Calamos Partners LLC   ( Calamos Partners )  , a Delaware limited liability company, and John P. Calamos, Sr., the Founder, Chairman and Global Chief Investment Officer of CAM. Calamos Partners received its interest from Calamos Family Partners, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on July 26, 2016. CAM, together with Calamos Investments and Calamos Investments  subsidiaries   (the  Company )  , operates the investment advisory and distribution services businesses reported within these consolidated financial statements. CAM operates and is the sole manager, and thus controls all of the business and affairs of Calamos Investments and, as a result of this control, consolidates the financial results of Calamos Investments with its own financial results. Calamos Partners' and John P. Calamos, Sr.'s (collectively   "Calamos Interests"  ) ownership interest, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, is reflected and referred to within these consolidated financial statements as "non-controlling interest in Calamos Investments LLC". As shown in the diagram below, Calamos Partners also owns all of CAM s outstanding Class B common stock, which represents   97.4%   of the combined voting power of all classes of CAM s voting stock. The graphic below illustrates our organizational and ownership structure as of   September 30, 2016  :

For reporting purposes, the offshore funds are included within the open-end funds. 
   
  (2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America   ( GAAP )  , which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management believes the accounting estimates are appropriate and reasonably stated; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual amounts could differ from these estimates.  
  The consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015   have not been audited by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. In the opinion of management, these statements contain all adjustments, including those of a normal recurring nature, necessary for fair presentation of the financial condition and results of operations. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year. This Form 10-Q filing should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  New Accounting Guidance 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  "FASB"  ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , to add or clarify guidance on the   classification of  certain cash receipts and cash payments, such as debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, on the statement of cash flows. The amendment is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance, resulting in debt extinguishment costs of   $4.9 million   being classified as cash flows from financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company implemented Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which amended the consolidation requirements under GAAP, on January 1, 2016, using the modified retrospective method. The modified retrospective method did not require the restatement of prior year periods. In connection with the adoption of this guidance, the Company reevaluated all of its investments for consolidation, including its investments in open-end funds. The adoption of the guidance resulted in open-end funds regulated outside the U.S. previously accounted for as voting interest entities (  "VOE"  ) to be evaluated as variable interest entities (  "VIE"  ) and led to the consolidation of   five   open-end funds that were previously accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The adoption also resulted in the consolidation of   four   U.S. regulated open-end funds that were previously accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The impact to the consolidated statements of financial condition upon adoption was the consolidation of   $333.6 million   of assets,   $15.4 million   of liabilities, and   $318.2 million   of redeemable non-controlling interests. In connection with the adoption, the Company reclassified   $1.9 million   and   $6.6 million  , respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings and non-controlling interest in Calamos Investments LLC. Additional disclosures related to consolidated voting interest entities and variable interest entities, and the impact the new accounting guidance has had on the quarter are included in Note 5,   Consolidated Funds and Partnership Investments  . 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of CAM, Calamos Investments, Calamos Investments  wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company s partnerships, and open-end funds in which it has a controlling financial interest or operating control. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a   50%   controlling interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
  The Calamos Interests  combined   77.8%   interest in Calamos Investments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is represented as a non-controlling interest in Calamos Investments LLC in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The non-controlling interest in Calamos Investments is derived by multiplying the historical equity of Calamos Investments by the Calamos Interests  aggregate ownership percentage for the periods presented. Issuances and repurchases of CAM s common stock may result in changes to CAM s ownership percentage and to the non-controlling interests  ownership percentage of Calamos

Investments with resulting changes reflected in the consolidated statements of changes in equity. Income is allocated based on the average ownership interest during the period in which the income is earned. 
  CAM owns certain assets to which it has exclusive economic rights. As of   September 30, 2016  , these assets included cash and cash equivalents of   $55.8 million  , net non-current deferred tax assets of   $37.0 million  , net current income taxes receivable of   $256,000  , and a loan receivable from Calamos Investments of   $45.0 million  . As of   December 31, 2015  , these assets included cash, cash equivalents and investment securities of   $77.3 million  , net current and non-current deferred tax assets of   $38.3 million  , net current income taxes receivable of   $355,000  , and a loan receivable from Calamos Investments of   $25.0 million  . These assets are reported together with Calamos Investments  consolidated assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Additionally, net income before income taxes of   $23.3 million   and   $14.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, each included   $303,000   and   $721,000  , respectively, of interest income and realized gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents held solely by CAM. These portions of CAM s income and expense are not affected by non-controlling interests. 
  The Company consolidates investments in which the Company s controlling interest exceeds   50%  , or in which the Company operates and controls the business and affairs of the entity or is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. In order to make this determination, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment in an affiliate, partnership or open-end fund is a VOE or VIE. The analysis involves judgment and considers several factors, including an entity s legal organization, capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders, the Company's ownership interest in the entity, and its contractual involvement with the entity. The Company continually reviews and reconsiders its previously reached VIE or VOE conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events, such as changes to its ownership interest, changes to an entity s organization and legal structure, or amendments to governing documents.  
  The open-end funds that the Company consolidates in its consolidated financial statements are generally those products to which it provided initial seed capital at the time of their formation and has a controlling interest. The Company's U.S. regulated open-end funds are considered VOEs while those regulated outside the U.S. are considered VIEs. VIEs are entities that, by design (i  )   lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities independently, or (ii) have equity holders that do not have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, the obligation to absorb the entity s losses, or the rights to receive the entity s residual returns. The Company consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary, which is the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant. For the periods the funds and partnerships are consolidated, the assets and liabilities of the funds and partnerships are presented as consolidated funds and partnership investments and liabilities of consolidated funds and partnership investments, respectively, in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The net income for these funds and partnerships is included in investment and other income in the consolidated statements of operations, and the change in funds and partnership investments is included in contributions to or distributions from consolidated funds and partnership investments in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The combined interests of all of the consolidated funds and partnerships not owned by the Company and that are redeemable at the option of the holder, are presented as redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated funds and partnership investments in the Company s consolidated financial statements for the periods those funds and partnerships were consolidated. See Note 5,   Consolidated Funds and Partnership Investments  , for more discussion regarding these funds. 
  Calamos Investments, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates, is indirectly the general partner and controls the operations of Calamos Global Opportunities Fund LP. The results of this partnership are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
  The Company holds non-controlling interests in certain other partnership investments that are included in partnership investments and consolidated funds in the consolidated statements of financial condition. These other partnership investments are accounted for under the equity method. 
  Restricted Cash 
  The Company has a   $430,000   security deposit related to a property lease that is restricted from the Company s general corporate use and is being reported in other non-current assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition. 
  Treasury Stock 
  On November 13, 2014, the Company announced a repurchase of up to an additional   3 million   shares of the Company's outstanding Class A Common Stock primarily to continue to manage the dilution from share issuances under the Company s incentive compensation plan. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Calamos Investments repurchased   525,328   shares of Class A common stock, at an average purchase price of   $8.95   and a total cost of   $4.7 million   under this repurchase program. As Calamos Investments is consolidated with CAM, the repurchased shares are reported as treasury shares. As such, CAM s   22.2%   ownership interest in these shares totaling   $1.0 million   is reported in treasury stock, with Calamos Interests    77.8%   ownership interest in

CALAMOS ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

these shares, totaling   $3.7 million  , reported in non-controlling interest in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The total shares repurchased are not included in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with GAAP. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , CAM redeemed   6,634   and   361,679  , respectively, Class A common shares from Calamos Investments for a value of   $75,000   and   $4.1 million  , respectively, which represents the fair value of the shares on the date of redemption. As Calamos Investments is consolidated with CAM, the impact of the distribution reflecting the non-controlling interest is   $58,000   and   $3.2 million  , respectively.  
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , dividends on shares held by Calamos Investments totaled   $567,000   and   $1.7 million  , respectively. The payment of these dividends increased Calamos Investments' equity by   $441,000   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , and   $1.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from additional paid in capital to non-controlling interest in Calamos Investments LLC in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Those amounts represent Calamos Interests' ownership interest in those dividend payments.  
  For a comprehensive disclosure of the Company's significant accounting policies, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  (3)  Investment Securities 
  The Company carries all investment securities it owns at fair value and records all changes in fair value in current earnings or as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in equity. As such, unrealized gains and losses on trading securities, as well as realized gains and losses on all investment securities, are included in investment and other income in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported, net of CAM's deferred income tax, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in equity until realized. 
  The following table provides a summary of investment securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

11 

CALAMOS ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

The investments in Funds at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   of   $57.6 million   and   $256.7 million  , respectively, were invested in affiliated funds that are not consolidated and accounts that are separately managed. In connection with the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2016, the Company reevaluated all of its investments for consolidation, including its investments in open-end funds. The Company determined that its interests in certain available-for-sale securities with a fair value of   $197.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  , were deemed controlling interests under the new accounting guidance and resulted in these open-end funds being consolidated on January 1, 2016.  
  The aggregate fair value of available-for-sale investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $164,000   and   $12.5 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   investment securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer. 
  The Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of   $55,000   and   $374,000  , respectively, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   on certain available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses. Other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   $4.5 million   and   $5.3 million  , respectively. The other-than-temporary impairment charges were reported in non-operating income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company believes that the remaining   $4,000   and   $443,000  , respectively, in unrealized losses on certain available-for-sale securities are only temporary in nature, as these losses are a result of short-term declines in the net asset value of the funds. Further, the Company has the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the fair value. The Company also considered current market conditions and the nature of the securities held when determining the recoverability of those securities' fair value.  
  The following table provides a summary of changes in investment securities for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

CALAMOS ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

The table below summarizes the tax provision (benefit) on unrealized gains (losses) and (gains) losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on available-for-sale securities for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Reclassification of realized (gains) losses out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reported in non-operating income (loss), in investment income (loss), in the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 9,   Non-Operating Income (Loss)  . 
   
  (4)  Derivative Assets and Liabilities 
  The Company used exchange-traded option contracts as an economic hedge of price changes in its investment securities portfolio in order to reduce the volatility equity markets have on the fair value of the Company's corporate investment portfolio and that could result in realized or unrealized gains and losses. The Company's investment securities and consolidated funds, net of redeemable non-controlling interest, totaling   $216.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , consist primarily of positions in several Calamos equity and fixed income funds. The equity price risk in the investment portfolio may be hedged using exchange-traded option contracts that correlate most closely with the change in value of the portfolio being hedged. The use of these option contracts are part of a hedge overlay strategy to minimize downside risk in the hedged portfolio. The Company may adjust its hedge position in response to movement and volatility in prices and changes in the composition of the hedged portfolio, but generally is not actively buying and selling contracts. 
  The Company has elected not to offset its derivative assets with its derivative liabilities even if a right of offset exists. When applicable, the fair value of option contracts is reported on a gross basis in derivative assets and derivative liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Net gains and losses on these contracts are reported in investment and other income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded net losses of   $3.7 million   and   $8.4 million  , respectively, on these contracts for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company did not record a gain or loss for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The Company may use these derivatives for risk management purposes but does not designate the contracts as hedges for accounting purposes. The Company had   $6.9 million   and   $4.3 million  , respectively, of derivative assets outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $15.5 million   and   $5.5 million  , respectively, of derivative liabilities outstanding.

(5)  Consolidated Funds and Partnership Investments 
  Presented below are the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds and partnership investments that the Company reports on a consolidated basis, as well as partnership investments that the Company accounts for under the equity method. These investments are presented as consolidated funds and partnership investments and liabilities of consolidated funds and partnership investments, respectively, in its consolidated statements of financial condition as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

The Company's U.S. regulated open-end funds are considered voting interest entities while those regulated outside the U.S. are considered variable interest entities. The Company is required to recognize the valuation changes associated with all underlying investments held by these funds in its consolidated financial statements of operations, and disclose the portion attributable to third party investors as net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests.

Profits and losses are allocated to the general partner and limited partners in proportion to their ownership interests at the beginning of each month. Partners' admissions, additional contributions and withdrawals are permitted on a monthly basis. 
   
  (6)  Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company utilizes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1   observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets; Level 2   inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices of similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, fair value adjustments to quoted foreign securities, etc.); and Level 3   unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, and require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. For each period presented, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 measurements. Transfers between levels are measured at the end of the reporting period. The Company had no transfers between levels during the period. 
  Investments are presented in the consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with GAAP. Investments in open-end funds are stated at fair value based on end of day published net asset values of shares owned by the Company. The fair value of investment securities and consolidated funds, net of redeemable non-controlling interest, in open-end funds was   $180.5 million   and   $228.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. There are no unfunded commitments related to these investments. These investments may be redeemed daily with a redemption notice period of up to   seven days  . Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange are stated at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation. Other securities, including derivatives, traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated at the last quoted bid price. However, short sales positions and call options written are reported at the last quoted ask price. Convertible bonds, fixed income securities and other securities for which quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value based on observable inputs such as market prices for similar instruments as validated by third party pricing agencies and the Company s prime broker. Debt securities are valued based upon prices received from an independent pricing service or from a dealer or broker who makes markets in such securities. Pricing services utilize various observable market data and as such, debt securities are generally categorized as Level 2. 
  The following tables provide the hierarchy of inputs used to derive the fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Foreign currency contracts are carried in the Company's consolidated funds and partnership investments and are presented on a net basis where the right of offset exists, and had an insignificant impact for the periods presented.

The fair value of the Company s long-term debt, which had a total carrying value of   $46.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  , was approximately   $51.6 million  , calculated using discounted cash flows based on the Company's incremental borrowing rates and market inputs for similar bonds. The fair value of the debt was based on Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. The Company repaid its long-term debt on July 28, 2016 and incurred debt extinguishment costs of   $4.9 million  , included in non-operating income (loss). 
  The fair value and carrying value of the Company's contingent consideration at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was   $409,000   and   $998,000  , respectively. This contingent consideration is associated with the Company's purchase of Phineus Partners LP in 2015, reported in other current and non-current liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration is not material, and is included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration is based on Level 3 unobservable inputs within the fair value hierarchy as it is calculated using certain assumptions regarding business performance and probability of payment. 
  The carrying value of all other financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these financial instruments. 
   
  (7)  Loans Payable 
  The Company has access to margin loans for the settlement of option liabilities, as well as an additional source of liquidity. The interest rate that can be charged on margin loans is   1.75%   per annum, based on the brokerage firm s lending rate. These loans are due on demand. The Company had no margin loan balances outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

(8)  Stock-Based Compensation 
  Under the Company s incentive compensation plan, certain employees of the Company receive stock-based compensation comprised of stock options and restricted stock units   ( RSUs )  . Historically, RSUs have been settled with newly issued shares so that no cash was used by the Company to settle awards; however, the Company may also use treasury shares upon the exercise of stock options and upon conversion of RSUs. The Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   provides details of this plan and its provisions. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   2,364,892   RSUs and there were   158,768   RSUs forfeited. The RSUs granted in the first   nine   months of   2016  , included awards to key investment personnel and officers as part of a strategic plan to promote retention and succession planning. During the same period, the Company granted   no   stock options and there were   299,412   stock options forfeited. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   478,173   RSUs vested with   116,494   units withheld for taxes and   361,679   RSUs converted into an equal number of shares of CAM s Class A common stock. The total intrinsic value and the fair value of the converted shares was   $3.1 million  . The total tax benefit realized in connection with the vesting of the RSUs during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $412,000  , as the Company receives tax benefits based upon the portion of Calamos Investments  expense that it recognizes. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , compensation expense recorded in connection with the RSUs and stock options was   $5.7 million   and   $4.7 million  , respectively, of which   $1.3 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, was credited as additional paid-in capital after giving effect to the non-controlling interests. The amount of deferred tax asset created was   $467,000   and   $382,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $21.1 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option and RSU awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   4.0   years. 
   
  (9)  Non-Operating Income (Loss) 
  Non-operating income (loss) was comprised of the following components for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

(10)  Income Taxes 
  Calamos Investments is subject to certain income-based state taxes; therefore, income taxes reflect not only the portion attributed to CAM stockholders but also a portion of income taxes attributable to non-controlling interests. 

________________ 
  * Not meaningful 
  CAM's effective income tax rate was   40.8%   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with   (13.4)%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . For the first   nine   months of   2016  , CAM's income tax provision was consistent with income before income tax provision attributable to CAM, resulting in an income tax rate that was not meaningful. The income tax provision for the first   nine   months of   2016   included   $964,000   of deferred tax expense related to expired employee stock options and an allowance for employee stock options expected to expire in future periods. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's valuation allowance on this deferred tax asset was   $628,000  . Excluding the deferred tax valuation allowance and deferred tax expense related to expired employee stock options, CAM's effective income tax rate would be   41.2%   for the first   nine   months of   2016  . CAM's effective income tax rate was   40.0%   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , a result of   $238,000   of deferred tax expense related to expired employee options in the prior year.  
  On January 1, 2016 the Company early adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The Company has applied the requirements of this standard prospectively, which resulted in the reclassification of   $8.3 million   from current deferred tax assets to non-current deferred tax assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition as of January 1, 2016. 
   
  (11)  Earnings Per Share 
  The following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

When dilutive, diluted shares outstanding are calculated (a) assuming that Calamos Interests exchanged all of their ownership interest in Calamos Investments and their CAM Class B common stock for shares of CAM s Class A common stock (the "  Exchange  ")  
  
   19 

CALAMOS ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

and (b) including the effect of outstanding dilutive equity incentive compensation awards. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , the impact of the Exchange was anti-dilutive and, therefore, excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 
  The Company uses the treasury stock method to reflect the dilutive effect of unvested RSUs and unexercised stock options on diluted earnings (loss) per share. Under the treasury stock method, if the average market price of common stock increases above the option s exercise price, the proceeds that would be assumed to be realized from the exercise of the option would be used to acquire outstanding shares of common stock. However, the awards may be anti-dilutive even when the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the option s exercise price. This result is possible because compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized is included as a component of the assumed proceeds upon exercise. The dilutive effect of such options and RSUs would increase the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 
  The Company amended its certificate of incorporation requiring that the Exchange be based on a fair value approach (details of the amendment are set forth in the Company s Schedule 14C filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 12, 2009). The amendment results in the same or fewer shares of Class A common stock being issuable at the time of the Exchange. 
  The shares issuable upon the Exchange as presented are estimated solely on the formula as described in Schedule 14C that does not necessarily reflect all inputs used in a fair valuation. It is critical to note that this formula does not incorporate certain economic factors and as such, in the event of an actual Exchange, the majority of the Company s independent directors may determine the fair market value of CAM s net assets and its ownership in Calamos Investments. For example, premiums and/or discounts for control and marketability as well as a different discount rate for future cash flows may be applied. Therefore, the directors  valuation may result in the actual number of shares being materially different from the shares presented. Further, based upon currently available information, the Company believes it is unlikely that any Exchange would transpire without a fair market valuation of CAM s net assets and possibly an agreement by Calamos Interests to Exchange, based upon that fair market valuation. 
  The following table shows the number of shares which were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as they were anti-dilutive: 

* Number of shares calculated with the value of Calamos Investments determined by using the closing price of our shares as of   September 30, 2016   (  $6.82  ) and   September 30, 2015   (  $9.48  ) as well as assuming said closing prices fully reflect all of CAM's assets; including the application of a   12%   discount rate to certain deferred tax assets at each of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The value of Calamos Investments is then multiplied by Calamos Interests' percentage ownership in Calamos Investments, with the result divided by the applicable period-end closing price. See Note 2,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Principles of Consolidation,   for a description of certain assets owned by CAM. 
   
  (12)  Commitments and Contingencies 
  In the normal course of business, the Company may be party to various legal proceedings from time to time. Management believes that a current complaint filed against CAL and CFS, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties with respect to the receipt of advisory, distribution and servicing fees paid by an open-end investment company advised by CAL, is without merit and CAL and CFS intend to defend themselves vigorously against the allegations. Currently, management believes that the ultimate resolution of this complaint will not materially affect the Company s business, financial position or results of operations and that the likelihood of a material adverse impact is remote. 
   
  (13)  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  The Company has reviewed all newly issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to its business and to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements, including those not yet required to be adopted. Accounting guidance that will become effective in future years, with respect to the Company s consolidated financial statements, is described below: 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update related to employee share-based payment accounting. The amendment includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in  
  
   20 

CALAMOS ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

the financial statements, including: income tax effects of share-based payments, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements and forfeitures. The amendment is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The provisions may be applied using various transition approaches, including prospective, retrospective and modified retrospective. The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update related to the accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The new guidance will require the change in fair value of equity instruments with readily determinable fair values to be recognized through the statements of operations. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the full impact of the standard, however, upon adoption the change in the fair value of available-for-sale securities will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations instead of accumulated other comprehensive income on the statements of financial position. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the new revenue guidance by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption being permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company's effective date is January 1, 2018. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
   
  (14)  Subsequent Event 
  The Company has received notice that one account, representing approximately   $1.1 billion  , or   5%  , of our total assets under management at   September 30, 2016  , will be terminated in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
   
  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and     Results of Operations 
   
  We are a firm of   335   full-time associates that primarily provides investment advisory services to institutions and individuals, managing and servicing   $20.1 billion   and   $22.5 billion   in assets under management as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Assets under management do not include assets under advisement of   $460 million   and   $612 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for which the Company provides model portfolio design and oversight. 
  Our operating results fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of our assets under management. The value and composition of our assets under management are, and will continue to be, influenced by a variety of factors including: purchases and redemptions of shares of open-end funds; net inflows into and withdrawals from separate accounts that we manage; fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of assets under management; and the number and types of our investment strategies and products. We routinely experience inflows and outflows in our assets under management. We have received notice that one account, representing approximately   $1.1 billion  , or   5%  , of our total assets under management at   September 30, 2016  , will be terminated in the fourth quarter of this year. The expected impact of this termination on annual revenue, if not replaced, is approximately   $4.8 million  . Based on our current pipeline and preliminary discussions with prospective new accounts, we see the potential to completely replace this lost revenue, starting with expected new awards in the first quarter of 2017. 
  We market our investment strategies to our clients through a variety of products designed to suit their investment needs. We currently categorize the portfolios that we manage within four investment product types captured in our funds and separate accounts. The following table lists our assets under management by product as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  
   21 

Our revenues are substantially comprised of investment management fees earned under contracts with funds and separate accounts that we manage or service. Our revenues are also comprised of distribution and underwriting fees, including asset-based distribution and/or service fees received pursuant to Rule 12b-1 plans. Investment management fees and distribution and underwriting fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors including: the total value and composition of our assets under management; market appreciation and depreciation on investments; the level of net inflows and outflows, which represent the sum of new and existing client funding, withdrawals and terminations; and purchases and redemptions of open-end fund shares. The mix of assets under management among our investment products impacts our revenues as our fee schedules vary by product. 
  Our largest operating expenses are typically related to: employee compensation and benefits expenses, which include salaries, incentive compensation and related benefits costs; distribution expenses, which include open-end funds distribution costs (such as Rule 12b-1 payments) and amortization of deferred sales commissions; and marketing and sales promotion expenses, which include expenses necessary to market products offered by us. Operating expenses may fluctuate due to a number of factors including variations in staffing and compensation, changes in distribution expense as a result of fluctuations in open-end fund net sales and market appreciation or depreciation, and marketing-related expenses that include supplemental distribution payments. 
  Operating Results 
  Third Quarter   and   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Third Quarter     and   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  Assets Under Management 
  Assets under management were   $20.1 billion   and   $22.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and consisted of   86%   funds and   14%   separate accounts as of   September 30, 2016  , and   84%   funds and   16%   separate accounts as of   September 30, 2015  .

  * Not meaningful 
  Fund sales in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016   were primarily due to our alternative, U.S. equity, and global equity strategies, but were not sufficient to overcome the aggregate outflows sustained from redemptions in these strategies. Net   redemptions   in our funds were   $651 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with net   redemptions   of   $619 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Market appreciation in our funds was   $556 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with market depreciation of   $1.3 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Net   redemptions   in our funds of   $1.7 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , represent   an unfavorable   change of   $500 million   from net   redemptions   of   $1.2 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Market appreciation in our funds totaled   $341 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with depreciation of   $918 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
  Separate accounts, which represent accounts we manage for both institutions and individuals, combined net   redemptions   were   $95 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with net   sales   of   $183 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Institutional net  
  
   23 

redemptions   were   $123 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , driven primarily from U.S. equity strategies, compared with net sales of   $136 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Managed account net   sales   were   $28 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with net sales of   $47 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Separate account combined appreciation in the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $109 million  , compared with depreciation of   $233 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
  Separate account net   redemptions   in the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $513 million  , compared with net   sales   of   $1.2 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . Institutional net   redemptions   were   $601 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with net   sales   of   $1.1 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . Managed account net   sales   were   $88 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with net   sales   of   $108 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . Separate account combined appreciation in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $3 million  , compared with depreciation of   $132 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
   
  Financial Overview   

  ________________ 
  * Not meaningful 
  Operating income for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $4.1 million  , compared with   $8.6 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Operating margin for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased to   8.5%   from   15.0%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The decrease in both operating income and operating margin for the   third   quarter of   2016   was primarily due to the decrease in investment management fees. Operating income for the  first   nine   months of   2016   decreased to   $10.9 million   from   $21.2 million   for the same period a year ago. Operating margin was   7.5%   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with   12.1%   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in both operating income and operating margin for the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily attributable to the decrease in investment management fees, partially offset by the closed-end fund launch expenses of   $11.5 million   in the prior year.  
   
  Revenues 
  Total revenues decreased by   $9.3 million  , or   16%  , to   $48.3 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $57.6 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Total revenues decreased by   $30.3 million  , or   17%  , to   $145.1 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , from   $175.4 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to lower investment management fees and distribution and underwriting fees.  

Investment management fees decreased by  15%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  , which was primarily due to a   $3.5 billion  , or   15%  , decrease in average assets under management for the same period. Investment management fees from open-end funds decreased by   20%   to   $20.7 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , from   $25.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  , driven by a   16%   decrease in average open-end fund assets. Investment management fees from our closed-end funds decreased by   9%   to   $14.4 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , from   $15.9 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  , due to a   9%   decrease in average closed-end fund assets. Investment management fees from our separately managed accounts decreased by   8%   to   $4.3 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , from   $4.6 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  , due to a   20%   decrease in average separately managed accounts assets under management. Investment management fees that we earned as a percentage of average assets under management for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   0.78%  , compared with   0.77%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Investment management fees from assets under advisement for which we provide model portfolio design and oversight were   $320,000   for  
  
   24 

the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with   $475,000   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Investment management fees that we earned for assets under advisement for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015   were   0.30%  .  
  Investment management fees decreased by   16%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared with the first   nine   months of   2015  , which was primarily due to a   $3.5 billion  , or   15%  , decrease in average assets under management for the same period. Investment management fees from open-end funds decreased by   22%   to   $62.5 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , from   $80.6 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , driven by a   19%   decrease in average open-end fund assets. Investment management fees from our closed-end funds decreased by   9%   to   $42.1 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , from   $46.1 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , due to a   9%   decrease in average closed-end fund assets. Investment management fees from our separately managed accounts decreased by   4%   to   $12.9 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , from   $13.4 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , due to a   6%   decrease in average separately managed accounts assets under management. Investment management fees that we earned as a percentage of average assets under management for the first   nine   months of   2016   were   0.77%  , compared with   0.78%   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Investment management fees from assets under advisement for which we provide model portfolio design and oversight were   $1.2 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with   $1.5 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Investment management fees that we earned for assets under advisement for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   were   0.30%  . 
  Distribution and underwriting fees decreased by   22%  , or   $2.2 million  , to   $8.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  . Distribution and underwriting fees decreased by   22%  , or   $7.1 million  , to   $24.8 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a shift in open-end fund assets from Class A, B and C shares to Class I shares. More open-end fund investors are choosing to compensate their financial advisors through fee-based models, increasing the demand for and a shift towards our Class I shares. Because we do not collect distribution fees from Class I shares, our distribution revenue has decreased with this shift in assets. For the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , average open-end fund assets decreased by   16%   and   19%  , respectively, across most share classes, compared with the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in average open-end fund assets when compared with the prior year period is largely due to net redemptions in our U.S. equity and alternative strategies. 
   
  Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses decreased by   $4.8 million   and   $20.0 million   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, from the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  . The   third   quarter of   2016   reflected decreases in distribution expenses, general and administrative, marketing and sales promotion expenses, and employee compensation and benefits expenses. For the first   nine   months of   2016   decreases in marketing and sales promotion expenses, distribution expenses, and general and administrative expenses were offset by an increase in employee compensation and benefits expenses. The first   nine   months of   2015   included   $11.5 million   of expenses related to the launch of a new closed-end fund, comprised of   $10.0 million   of marketing and sales promotion expenses and   $1.5 million   of employee compensation and benefits expenses.  

Employee compensation and benefits expenses decreased by   $212,000   and increased by   $2.5 million   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, when compared with the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in the   third   quarter of   2016   is primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses. The increase in the first   nine   months of   2016   is primarily due to increases in equity compensation expenses, offset by decreases in salary and related benefits expenses and incentive compensation expenses. The increase in equity compensation expenses for the first   nine   months of   2016   is primarily a result of short-term and long-term equity awards to key investment personnel and officers. These awards are part of a strategic plan to promote retention and succession planning. The first   nine   months of   2015   included incentive compensation expenses related to the launch of a new closed-end fund. 
  Distribution expenses decreased by   $2.2 million   and   $6.4 million   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, when compared with the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  . The decreases are primarily due to a shift of average open-end fund assets to Class I shares which do not result in distribution expenses. 
  
   25 

Marketing and sales promotion expenses decreased by   $644,000   and   $12.5 million   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, when compared with the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in the   third   quarter of   2016   is primarily due to lower reimbursements of fund operating expenses that are above the expense cap, and lower supplemental distribution payments to distribution intermediaries. The decrease in the first   nine   months of   2016   is largely the result of the launch of a new closed-end fund in the first quarter of   2015  , lower reimbursements of fund operating expenses that are above the expense cap, and lower supplemental distribution payments to distribution intermediaries. 
  General and administrative expenses decreased by   $1.8 million   and   $3.6 million   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, when compared with the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in the   third   quarter of   2016   is primarily due to lower professional services expenses and travel and entertainment expenses. The decrease in the first   nine   months of   2016   is due to reductions in professional services expenses, travel and entertainment expenses, occupancy-related costs, and depreciation expenses. 
   
  Non-Operating Activities, Net of Redeemable Non-controlling Interest in Consolidated Funds and Partnership Investments 
  Non-operating income (loss), net of redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated funds and partnership investments increased by   $11.8 million   and   $941,000   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, when compared with the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  . The increase in the   third   quarter of   2016   included an increase in investment income of   $40.9 million   offset by an increase in net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated funds and partnership investments of   $25.0 million   and   $4.9 million   in debt extinguishment costs related to the repayment of long-term debt on July 28, 2016. The increase in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with the first   nine   months of   2015  , was due to increases in investment income of   $22.7 million   and dividend income of   $815,000  , and a decrease in interest expense of   $596,000  , offset by an increase in net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated funds and partnership investments of   $18.2 million   and   $4.9 million   in debt extinguishment costs related to the repayment of long-term debt. The increase in investment income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared with the same period in   2015  , was mainly due to the consolidation of funds from the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement and realized and unrealized gains from investment securities offset by option contract losses within the Company's investment portfolio.  
  The following table summarizes our non-operating activities, net of redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated funds and partnership investments for the   third   quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

________________ 
            (1)    
    Non-operating income (loss), net of redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated funds and partnership investments is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure provides comparability of this information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing the Company s non-operating contribution to its results. 

26 

The following table provides a summary of the returns that we generated from our corporate investment portfolio. This table combines the investment and dividend income as reported in our consolidated statements of operations with the change in fair value of our investment securities that are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of equity, for the   third   quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Our investment portfolio returned   $10.6 million  , or   4.4%  , and   $5.0 million  , or   1.9%  , in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively. For the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016  , the results primarily reflect unrealized gains from investment securities, net of redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated funds and partnership investments, offset with option contract losses. Retained earnings was impacted by the consolidation of funds related to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement, resulting in an   $8.5 million   change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the first   nine   months of   2016  , which was adjusted in the table above when computing investment portfolio results.  
   
  Income Tax Provision 
  Calamos Investments LLC   ( Calamos Investments )   is subject to certain income-based state taxes; therefore, income taxes reflect not only the portion attributed to us but also income taxes attributable to non-controlling interests. CAM's effective income tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   was approximately   40.8%  , compared with   (13.4)%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . CAM's income tax provision for the first   nine   months of   2016   was consistent with income tax provision attributable to CAM, resulting in an income tax rate that was not meaningful. The income tax provision for the first   nine   months of   2016   included   $964,000   of deferred tax expense related to expired employee stock options and an allowance for employee stock options expected to expire in future periods. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's valuation allowance on this deferred tax asset was   $628,000  . Excluding the deferred tax valuation allowance and deferred tax expense related to expired employee stock options, CAM's effective income tax rate would be   41.2%   for the first   nine   months of   2016  . CAM's income tax rate was   40.0%   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , a result of   $238,000   of deferred tax expense related to expired employee stock options in the prior year. 
  On January 1, 2016 the Company early adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The Company has applied the requirements of this standard prospectively, which resulted in the reclassification of   $8.3 million   from current deferred tax assets to non-current deferred tax assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition as of January 1, 2016. 
   
  Net income 
  Net income attributable to CAM was   $1.2 million   and   $69,000   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, compared with   $363,000   and   $2.5 million   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of 2015. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CAM was   $2.5 million   and   $6.4 million   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, compared with   $3.3 million   and   $10.4 million   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  . See "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for descriptions of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. 
  
   27 

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We provide investors with certain adjusted, non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to CAM and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust GAAP financial measures to include the tax benefit from the amortization of deferred taxes on intangible assets, and to exclude closed-end fund launch expenses, net of taxes, and CAM s non-operating (income) loss, net of taxes. We believe these adjustments are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our operating financial performance, as well as to facilitate comparisons with our historical earnings results. These adjustments to our GAAP results are made with the intent of providing investors a more complete understanding of our underlying earnings results and trends and our marketplace performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis of managing our business. 
  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables below: 

________________ 
   (1)         For the first   nine   months of   2016  , the deferred tax amortization on intangible assets, the realization of which is not reflected in our consolidated statements of operations, resulted in cash savings of approximately   $1.2 million   during the period and the creation of a federal net operating loss carryforward benefit of approximately   $4.7 million   which can be utilized in future years, to the extent of net income, to offset the Company's income taxes payable. See Note 17,   Income Taxes  , to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.,   Financial Statements and Supplemental Data   included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
   (2)         Closed-end fund launch expenses are shown net of the non-controlling interest in Calamos Investments and income taxes. 
  
   28 

Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by adjusting for the closed-end fund launch expenses from GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP operating income by total revenues. 
  Non-GAAP net income attributable to CAM is calculated by adjusting the following items from GAAP net income attributable to CAM: 
           (i) 
    amortization of deferred taxes on intangible assets associated with the election under section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Section 754 election); 
              (ii) 
    closed-end fund launch expenses, net of taxes; and 
              (iii) 
    non-operating income, net of taxes. 
     Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to CAM by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
  The deferred tax assets from the Section 754 election allows for a quarterly reduction of $2.0 million in current and future income taxes owed by us, to the extent that a tax payable exists during the quarter. To the extent that the deferred tax asset exceeds net income, a federal net operating loss carryforward is created. The cash savings and any resulting net operating loss carryforward accrue solely for the benefit of the shareholders of CAM s common stock. We believe that adjusting this item from the calculation of the above non-GAAP items can be a useful measure in allowing investors to see our performance. Closed-end fund launch expenses, net of taxes, are excluded because revenue associated with these expenses will not fully impact results until future periods. Non-operating (income) loss is excluded from the above non-GAAP items as it can distort comparisons between periods. As noted above, we believe that measures excluding these items are useful in analyzing operating trends and allows for more comparability between periods, which may be useful to investors. 
  We believe that non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to CAM and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are useful measures of performance and may be useful to investors, because they provide measures of our core business activities adjusting for items that are non-cash and costs that may distort comparisons between periods. These measures are provided in addition to our operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to CAM and diluted earnings per share calculated under GAAP, but are not substitutes for those calculations. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We manage our liquidity position to ensure adequate resources are available to fund ongoing operations of the business, provide seed capital for new funds, provide conservative levels of capital for the Company s regulated subsidiaries, fund our stock repurchase program, and invest in other corporate strategic initiatives. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and our corporate investment portfolio, which is comprised of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, derivatives and partnership investments and consolidated funds. Investment securities are principally comprised of Company-sponsored funds. In addition, the individual securities held within our partnership investments are typically highly liquid. 
  We believe cash generated from operations, investing and financing activities will be sufficient over the foreseeable future to meet our working capital requirements and liquidity needs with respect to the foregoing activities, as well as to support future growth.  
  The following table summarizes our principal sources of liquidity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

We utilize a hedging strategy using exchange-traded equity option contracts as an economic hedge to reduce downside risk and price volatility of the total portfolio value. This strategy allows us the flexibility to continue to provide seed capital for the development of new products when necessary, while seeking to help reduce risk. 
  
   29 

On July 28, 2016, Calamos Investments repaid the balance of   $46.0 million   of long-term debt and incurred debt extinguishment costs of   $4.9 million  , included in non-operating income (loss). The notes were repaid out of cash on hand and the proceeds from an increase in the short term, interest-bearing loan from CAM. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Calamos Investments had a   $45.0 million   short-term, interest-bearing loan from CAM to fund new seed investments and to provide excess liquidity.  
  The following table summarizes key data relating to our liquidity and capital resources: 

The deferred tax assets above include an annual reduction of   $7.9 million   in future income taxes owed by us through 2019. This reduction results from our election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code, whereby we stepped up the tax basis in certain intangible assets to their fair market value. These assets are amortized over fifteen years on CAM s tax return. As a result, this cash savings will accrue solely for the benefit of the Company. 
  Cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are shown below. 

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled   $16.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . These net cash flows are primarily attributable to investment management and distribution and underwriting fees generated by core business activities, partially offset by staff, distribution, and other operating expenses. 
  Net cash provided by investing activities totaled   $44.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The net cash provided by investing activities primarily represents net cash inflows as a result of proceeds from sales of investments of   $35.5 million  , and distributions from consolidated funds and partnership investments of   $39.4 million  , partially offset by cash outflows of   $15.1 million   of seed capital to help expand our product offering,   $7.9 million   of contributions to consolidated funds and partnership investments, and   $4.4 million   related to the purchase of common shares of a Calamos-sponsored closed-end fund. 
  Net cash used in financing activities totaled   $89.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and primarily represents the repayment of long-term debt of   $46.0 million   and the pro rata equity and income tax distributions paid by Calamos Investments to our non-controlling interests of   $26.1 million  . Net cash used in financing activities was also due to cash dividends paid to common stockholders of   $7.5 million  , debt extinguishment costs of   $4.9 million  , and Calamos Investments' repurchase of   $4.7 million   in Class A common stock as a result of our stock repurchase program. Finally, we expect cash flows from financing activities to change with tax distributions based on the levels of income that the Company generates. 
   
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  The Company has reviewed all newly issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to its business and to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements, including those not yet required to be adopted. Accounting guidance that will become effective in future years, with respect to the Company s consolidated financial statements, is described below: 

30 

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  "FASB"  )  issued an accounting update related to employee share-based payment accounting. The amendment includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements, including: income tax effects of share-based payments, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements and forfeitures. The amendment is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The provisions may be applied using various transition approaches, including prospective, retrospective and modified retrospective. The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update related to the accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The new guidance will require the change in fair value of equity instruments with readily determinable fair values to be recognized through the statements of operations. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the full impact of the standard, however, upon adoption the change in the fair value of available-for-sale securities will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations instead of accumulated other comprehensive income on the statements of financial position. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the new revenue guidance by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption being permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company's effective date is January 1, 2018. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . A complete discussion of critical accounting policies is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Given the impact the implementation of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2016 has had on our consolidated financial statements, we now consider our consolidation policy one of the policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidation policy is discussed in Note 2,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.   There were no other significant changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting policies during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Other Information - Market Capitalization 
  Calamos Investments is owned (a)   22.2%   by CAM, and (b)   77.8%   by Calamos Interests. As of   September 30, 2016  , CAM holds two groups of assets: (1) CAM s   22.2%   ownership interest in Calamos Investments and (2) primarily cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, income tax receivables, net deferred tax assets, and a loan receivable from Calamos Investments. CAM presents the entire operations of Calamos Investments with its own in the consolidated financial statements. Calamos Interests    77.8%   ownership in Calamos Investments is presented as a non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial statements.  
  CAM s certificate of incorporation provides that ownership in Calamos Investments is exchangeable into Class A shares of CAM on a fair value basis. As a result, the reported market capitalization of CAM only reflects CAM s   22.2%   interest in Calamos Investments, rather than the full value of Calamos Investments.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of   September 30, 2016  , and has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  As previously reported in the Company's periodic reports, Calamos Advisors LLC and Calamos Financial Services LLC were named as defendants in a complaint captioned   Chill v. Calamos Advisors LLC, et at.   The complaint relates to investment advisory and distribution fees paid by an open-end investment company managed by Calamos Advisors LLC. The defendants believe that the complaint is without merit and intend to defend themselves vigorously against the allegations. 
  In the normal course of business, the Company may be a party to various legal proceedings and other regulatory matters. Currently, there is no such litigation or matters that management believes would have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
