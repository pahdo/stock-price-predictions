The

This information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition,
and outlook for the future, and should be read in conjunction with our Audited Annual Financial Statements Form 10-K.  

OVERVIEW
OF THE COMPANY   

CN
Resources Inc. is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, production, and sale of crude oil. Our
operations are conducted through a 100% wholly owned Ontario Corporation (also named CN Resources Inc.) which owns a producing
joint venture oil well in the Redwater area in Alberta, Canada.  

During
the Quarter ended August 31, 2016, Crude oil price is still depressed at an historical low level with WTI of $40 to $50 per barrel,
the Board of Directors has decided to take a cautious approach to further investments in this sector until a clear visibility
can be obtained before venturing into any capital commitment.  

The
Company s immediate core strategy is to create and enhance shareholder value by acquiring sustainable business with stable
cash flow. The Company will not acquire any business in early stage of development.  

Results
of Operations   

The
following is a discussion of our results of operations, financial condition and capital resources. You should read this discussion
in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the Notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Comparative results
of operations for the periods indicated are discussed below.  

The
following table sets forth certain of our oil operating information for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31,
2015.  

The
decrease in production and revenue is due to the crude price depression caused production to drop and revenue to decrease because
the incentive to increase production is not present. The increase in production costs are due to some vendor invoices were not
entered into prior periods because of the third party invoices late. However, this is not unusual for oil and gas industry in
Canada and it is beyond the Company s control.  

For
the period three-month period ended August 31, 2016, the following table indicates major variances compared with previous period.
The other expense items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations have no material variances.  

The
regulatory fee increase is due to small fee increase in the fiscal year. The professional fee was due to timing difference, the
Company received the fee invoice after August 31, 2016.  

Cash
Flow Analysis   

For
the three months ended August 31, 2016, we used $27,696 cash in operating activities (August 31, 2015 - $(14,659)), cash generated
from investing activities is $nil (August 31, 2015 - $3,979,349) and Cash flow generated from financing activities is $23,772(August
31,2015 - $9,388).  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

At
August 31, 2016, we have cash and cash equivalents on hand of $4,959,556(May 31, 2016 - $4,980,735), oil revenue receivable of
$19,524 (May 31, 2016 - $26,351). We have accounts payable of $100(May 31, 2016   $7,448) and we have no other material
debts to anyone.  

Planned
Capital Expenditures    

The
Company is evaluating its various options in its development strategies, have not committed to any specific capital expenditure
at this time due to the unsettling global market conditions for crude oil.  

Off
 Balance Sheet Arrangements

this item.  

ITEM
4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b)
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are not effective due to limited segregation of duties, lack
of independent directors, and no written internal control procedure manual. The Company plans to address the weaknesses in controls
as soon as the Company considers that the financial situation allows the Company to spend the limited resources to mitigate the
weaknesses in controls.  

There
were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
