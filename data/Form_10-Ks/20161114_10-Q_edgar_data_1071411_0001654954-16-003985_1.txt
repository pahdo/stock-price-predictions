Note 1. Organization and Business 

Fusion
Telecommunications International, Inc. is a Delaware corporation
incorporated in September 1997 ( Fusion  and together
with its subsidiaries, the  Company,   we, 
 us  and  our ). The Company is a provider
of integrated cloud solutions, including cloud voice, cloud
connectivity, cloud infrastructure, cloud computing, and managed
cloud-based applications to businesses of all sizes, and voice over
IP ( VoIP ) - based voice services to carriers. The
Company currently operates in two business segments: Business
Services and Carrier Services. 

Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in all material respects in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information.
Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), certain information
and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have
been condensed or omitted. The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the
same basis as the financial statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015. 

Because certain information and footnote disclosures have been
condensed or omitted, these unaudited consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ) as filed
with the SEC. In management s opinion, all normal and
recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation
of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
the periods presented have been included. Management believes that
the disclosures made in these unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements are adequate to make the information
not misleading. The results for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for the full year. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

For a detailed discussion of significant accounting policies,
please refer to the 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no material
changes in our accounting policies during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the
accounts of Fusion and each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of condensed consolidated interim financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Key
estimates include: the recognition of revenue, allowance for
doubtful accounts; asset lives used in computing depreciation and
amortization; valuation of intangible assets; accounting for stock
options and other equity awards particularly related to fair value
estimates; accounting for income taxes; contingencies; and
litigation. While management believes that such estimates are
reasonable when considered in conjunction with the financial
position and results of operations of the Company taken as a whole,
actual results could differ from those estimates, and such
differences could be material.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on deposit and short-term,
highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less
on the date of purchase. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates
fair value due to the short period to maturity. 

Restricted Cash 

Restricted
cash consists primarily of cash held in reserve pursuant to the
terms of financing arrangements and certificates of deposit that
serve to collateralize outstanding letters of credit. Restricted
cash is recorded as current or non-current assets in the
consolidated balance sheets depending on the duration of the
restriction and the purpose for which the restriction
exists. 

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had
certificates of deposit collateralizing a letter of credit in the
aggregate amount of approximately $27,000 and $165,000,
respectively. The letter of credit is required as security for one
of the Company s non-cancelable operating leases for office
facilities. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the
Company s accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximates its fair value due to the short term nature
of these financial instruments. 

Long-Lived Asset Impairment 

The
Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, including
intangible assets subject to amortization, for possible impairment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in
management s judgment, that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by such
asset or asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than
the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment loss
is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. The Company did not
record any impairment charges during the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 or 2015, as there were no indicators of
impairment.

Goodwill 

Goodwill
represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of
net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not
amortized and is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the
fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A
significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an
indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators include, but
are not limited to, deterioration in general economic conditions,
adverse changes in the markets in which a company operates,
increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and
cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over
multiple periods. 

In
testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to
first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence
of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more
likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company
elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an
impairment is more likely than not, it is then required to perform
a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is
required. The Company also may elect not to perform the qualitative
assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative
impairment test. 

Under
the goodwill two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company
reviews for impairment the fair value of each reporting unit to its
carrying value. The Company has determined that its reporting units
are its operating segments (see Note 15). The first step compares
the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount,
including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, the second step would be conducted;
otherwise, no further steps are necessary as no potential
impairment exists. The second step compares the implied fair value
of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that
goodwill. Any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value
over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an
impairment loss. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
goodwill was approximately $28.0 million and $27.0 million,
respectively. All of the Company s goodwill is attributable
to its Business Services segment. There was no impairment charge
recorded for goodwill during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 or 2015, as there were no indicators of
impairment. 

The following table presents the changes in the carrying amounts of
goodwill during the nine months ended September 30,
2016: 

*Acquisition
of Fidelity Access Networks, LLC, Fidelity Connect LLC, Fidelity
Voice Services, LLC and Fidelity Access Networks, Inc., (together
with Fidelity Telecom, LLC hereinafter collectively referred to as
 Fidelity ) 

Advertising and Marketing Costs 

Costs
related to advertising and marketing are expensed as incurred and
included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Our advertising and marketing expense was approximately $154,000
and $145,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and approximately $508,000 and $390,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Income Taxes 

The
Company complies with accounting and reporting requirements with
respect to accounting for income taxes, which require an asset and
liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income
taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible
amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable
income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to
reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

In
accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to determine
whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority,
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation
processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax
benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of
benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. Derecognition of a tax benefit previously
recognized could result in the Company recording a tax liability
that would reduce net assets. Based on its analysis, the Company
has determined that it has not incurred any liability for
unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major
taxing authorities for all tax years since 2011 and its tax returns
may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on
factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and
changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. No
interest expense or penalties have been recognized as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized no
adjustments for uncertain tax positions. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The
Company recognizes expense for its employee stock-based
compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are
granted. The fair values of stock options are estimated at the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The use of
the Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of
subjective assumptions. Measured compensation cost, net of
estimated forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting
period of the related stock-based compensation award. For
transactions in which goods or services are the consideration
received from non-employees in return for the issuance of equity
instruments, the expense is recognized in the period when the goods
and services are received at the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued,
whichever is determined to be a more reliable
measurement. 

New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standard Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation
(Topic 718). The standard is intended to simplify several areas of
accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the
income tax impact, classification of the award as equity or as a
liability, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU
2016-09 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
reporting period. The Company does not expect this guidance to have
a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases , which is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Under ASU 2016-02,
lessees will be required to recognize for all leases at the
commencement date a lease liability, which is a lessee s
obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on
a discounted basis, and a right-to-use asset, which is an asset
that represents the lessee s right to use or control the use
of a specified asset for the lease term. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its
financial statements and related disclosures. 

In
November 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes  (ASU 2015-17), which
simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring
deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on
the balance sheet. The updated standard is effective beginning on
January 1, 2017 with early application permitted as of the
beginning of any interim or annual reporting period. The Company
does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements. 

In
September 2015, FASB issued guidance that eliminates the
requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account
for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead,
acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the
period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on
earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous
periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition
date. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

In
April 2015, FASB issued guidance requiring an entity to present
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a
direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability,
consistent with debt discounts. This guidance was effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2015. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016 and
applied the provision 

10 

FUSION TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

retrospectively
for fiscal 2015 (see Note 11). The adoption of this guidance by the
Company resulted in an approximately $1.0 million decrease in other
assets, and a decrease of $1.0 million in notes payable as of
December 31, 2015. 

In May
2014, FASB issued guidance that outlines a single comprehensive
model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from
contracts with customers and supersedes most recent current revenue
recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The
core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. The guidance also specifies the accounting for certain
incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfill a
contract with a customer. Entities have the option of applying
either a full retrospective approach to all periods presented or a
modified approach that reflects differences prior to the date of
adoption as an adjustment to equity. In April 2015, FASB deferred
the effective date of this guidance until January 1, 2018. The
Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its
consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3. Loss per share 

Basic
and diluted loss per share is computed by dividing (i) loss
available to common stockholders, adjusted by an approximately $1.2
million gain on the fair value of the Company s derivative
liability for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and $1.9
million gain on the fair value of the Company s derivative
liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was
attributable to 728,333 outstanding warrants issued by Fusion with
a nominal exercise price that were exercised in August 2015 and
dividends paid on Fusion s preferred stock, by (ii) the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
period, increased by the number of common shares underlying such
warrants as if such exercise had occurred at the beginning of the
year. 

The
following table sets forth the computation for basic and diluted
net income per share for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015: 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the following were
excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share
because of their anti-dilutive effects:

FUSION TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES

(Unaudited) 

The net
loss per common share calculation includes a provision for
preferred stock dividends on Fusion s outstanding Series A-1,
A-2 and A-4 preferred stock (the  Series A Preferred
Stock ) of approximately $102,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, and approximately $302,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Through September 30,
2016, the Board of Directors of Fusion has never declared a
dividend on any series of the Series A Preferred Stock, resulting
in approximately $4.6 million of accumulated preferred stock
dividends.  The Board of Directors has declared a dividend of
$183,917 and $599,491 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, on the Company s Series B-2 preferred
stock (the  Series B-2 Preferred Stock ), which, as
permitted by the terms of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, was paid
in the form of 122,601 and 343,510 shares, respectively, of
Fusion s common stock.  In addition, during the
three months ended March 31, 2016, the Board of Directors paid an
additional $1.2 million in dividends in the form of 666,667 shares
of Fusion s common stock to a holder of 5,000 shares of
Series B-2 Preferred Stock in connection with their agreement to
convert all of their Series B-2 Preferred Stock holdings into
shares of Fusion s common stock.  

Note 4. Intangible Assets 

Intangible
assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as
follows: 

Amortization
expense was $1.4 million and $1.9 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $4.1 million and $5.6
million, respectively. Estimated future aggregate amortization
expense is expected to be as follows: 

Note 5. Stock based compensation 

Fusion's stock-based compensation plan provides for the issuance of
stock options to the Company s employees, officers, and
directors. The Compensation Committee of Fusion s Board of
Directors (the "Compensation Committee") approves all awards under
Fusion's stock-based compensation plan.

The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine
the fair value of the stock options granted under Fusion s
stock-based compensation plan using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model: 

*The dividend yield is zero as the Company has never paid and does
not expect to pay dividends on its common stock.

Restricted Stock 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Fusion awarded

million consisting of $277,281 in cash and a royalty fee equal to
ten percent of the collected monthly recurring revenues derived
from sales of the cloud version of the proprietary call center
software and maintenance services. The estimated royalty fee of
$1,011,606 was recognized as a  non-current liability 
in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and will be paid on a
quarterly basis, commencing as of the first full calendar quarter
following the second anniversary of the closing date of the TFB
acquisition. The aggregate purchase price has been allocated to the

The amount of goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the
expected contributions of TFB to the overall corporate strategy in
the cloud based call center solutions and synergies of the acquired
business. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be

Note 11. Debt 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, long-term debt was as
follows: 

Secured Credit Facility 

In
August 2015, the Company entered into a $40.0 million credit
facility with Opus Bank, which facility was amended and restated on
December 8, 2015 (the  Opus Facility ). The Opus
Facility consists of a $15.0 million revolving four-year credit
facility, and a $25.0 million, five-year term loan. The maturity
date of amounts borrowed under the revolving facility is August 28,
2019, and the maturity date of amounts borrowed under the term loan
is August 28, 2020. 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had borrowed $15.0 million under
the revolver and $25.0 million under the term loan. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, under the Opus Facility
the Company recognized interest expense of approximately $0.5
million and $1.5 million, respectively, at a monthly interest rate
of 4.75%. The interest rate is calculated as the higher of (a) the
rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from
time to time by the Wall Street Journal as its   prime rate   (or the
average prime rate if a high and a low prime rate are therein
reported)  plus  the
Applicable Margin (as defined in the Opus Facility) in effect at
such time, or (b) 3.25%  plus  the Applicable
Margin. 

Pursuant to the Opus Facility, the Company must
satisfy various customary financial covenants such as borrower
leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, capital expenditures
annual limit, minimum adjusted EBITDA, and maximum senior leverage
ratio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company exceeded its leverage and senior leverage ratio
covenants.   On November 7, 2016,
Opus Bank waived these covenants breaches. As a result of this
waiver, we were in compliance with our obligations under this
facility as of September 30, 2016.  

Praesidian Facility 

On December 8, 2015, the Company entered into the Fourth Amended
and Restated Securities Purchase Agreement and Security Agreement
(the  Fourth Amended SPA ) with the Company s
subordinated lenders (which, collectively with its prior versions
is hereinafter referred to as the  Praesidian
Facility ). Under the Praesidian Facility, the Company is
required to satisfy financial covenants similar to those required
under the Opus Facility. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company was not in compliance with the
leverage ratio covenant under this facility.   On November 7, 2016,
Praesidian waived our events of default with respect to
non-compliance with the leverage ratio. As a result of this waiver,
we were in compliance with our obligations under the 
 Fourth Amended
SPA   as of September 30,
2016.  

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
paid interest expense of approximately $0.9 million and $2.8
million, at an annual interest rate of 10.8%.

Related Party Note Payable 

The
note payable to Marvin Rosen, the Chairman of Fusion s Board
is subordinated to borrowings under the Opus Facility and the
Fourth Amended SPA. This note is unsecured, pays interest monthly
at an annual rate of 7%, and matures 120 days after amounts
borrowed under the Opus Facility and the Fourth Amended SPA are
paid in full. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized
interest expense on the Rosen note of approximately $64,000 and
amortization discount of approximately $38,000. 

Note Payable to RootAxcess Seller 

In
connection with its purchase of the assets of RootAxcess, LLC
( RootAxcess ) in September 2015, the Company held back
$0.7 million against potential claims arising from breaches of
representation and warranties. Of such amount, $0.4 million is to
be paid to the seller in six equal installments of $66,667 on each
of the three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen and eighteen month
anniversary of the closing date. The remaining $0.3 million to be
paid in three equal installments of $100,000 on each of the twelve,
fifteen, and eighteen month anniversary of the closing date. To the
extent there is a unresolved claim notice pending (as defined in
the RootAxcess asset purchase agreement), the monthly installment
payable to seller immediately following the delivery of such claim
notice may, at the Company s reasonable discretion, be
reduced by the amount in dispute under the claim notice and such
amount will continue to be held by the Company until resolved, at
which point, the Company will disburse the withheld amount in
accordance with such resolution. 

On
September 30, 2016, the Company made a payment of $127,306 net of
an adjustment of $39,360 to the seller in connection with the terms
of the asset purchase agreement. At September 30, 2016, the
remaining balance due is $333,334. 

Note Due to TFB Seller 

In connection with the purchase of the assets of TFB in March 2016,
the Company recorded a contingent liability of $1,011,606 (see Note
6). The contingent liability was based on a royalty fee payable to
the sellers equal to ten percent of the collected monthly recurring
revenues to be derived from the sale of the cloud version of the
proprietary call center software and maintenance services. In
accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement, the
royalty fees will be paid on a quarterly basis, commencing as of
the first full calendar quarter following the second anniversary of
the closing date of the TFB acquisition or March 31, 2018 and will
continue for a period of 31 calendar quarters. In addition, a
portion of the salary paid to the sellers for a period of two years
following the acquisition date constitutes an advancement against
any royalty fee owed to the sellers. 

At September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance is $961,606, net of
a salary advance of $50,000. There were no changes to the
contingent liability based on the Company s evaluation of the
factors used to determine the fair value of the purchase
price. 

Note 12. Derivative Liability 

Fusion has issued warrants to purchase shares of its common stock
in connection with certain debt and equity financing transactions.
These warrants are accounted for in accordance with the guidance
contained in   ASC
Topic 815  ,
   Derivatives
and Hedging    ( ASC
815 ). For warrant instruments that do not meet an exclusion
from derivative accounting, the Company classifies such instruments
as a liability at its fair value and adjusts the instrument to fair
value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to
re-measurement at each balance sheet date until the warrant is
exercised or expires, and any change in fair value
is     recognized
in the Company s statement of operations. In this regard,
Fusion has 584,834 outstanding warrants which provide for a
downward adjustment of the exercise price if Fusion were to
issue

(Unaudited) 

common stock at an issuance price, or issue convertible debt or
equity securities with an exercise price, that is less than the
exercise price of these warrants. In addition, in connection with
the sale of certain notes under the original Praesidian Facility,
Fusion issued nominal warrants to the original lenders to purchase
an aggregate of 728,333 shares of Fusion s common stock. The
nominal warrants were exercised in August 2015. The fair values of
these warrants have been estimated using option pricing and other
valuation models, and the quoted market price of Fusion s
common stock. 

The
following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the
warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015: 

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of the
derivative was $233,934 and $953,005, respectively. For the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized a
gain on the change in the fair value of this derivative of
approximately $152,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, and a gain
of approximately $380,000 and $2.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company adjusted the
valuation of its derivative liability for warrants issued in
December 2013 and January 2014 and its valuation of certain
warrants exercised during 2015. The amount of the adjustment was a
net $772,022 impact on the condensed consolidated statements of
operations resulting from the loss on the change in the fair value
of the derivative and an additional $338,972 impact to capital in
excess of par and $433,050 increase in derivative liability in the
condensed consolidated balance sheets (see Note 17). The Company
has evaluated these adjustments in accordance with ASC 250-10-S99,
SEC Materials (formerly SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 99,
Materiality) and concluded that both quantitatively and
qualitatively the adjustments were not material. These adjustments
were also evaluated by management in their assessment of internal
controls over financial reporting. 

Note 13. Equity Transactions 

Common Stock 

Fusion is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of its common

and 12,788,971 shares of its common stock, respectively, were
issued and outstanding, respectively. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Fusion issued 26,500
shares of its common stock to a third party consultant for services
rendered, and 30,000 shares of common stock to  an employee in lieu of
a cash bonus  valued of $96,950. In addition, the Fusion
Board declared aggregate dividends of $599,491 on Fusion s
Series B-2 Preferred Stock, which, as permitted by the terms of the

into Fusion s common stock. The additional shares issued were
valued at the closing market price at the date of issuance of $1.80
per share or $1.2 million. 

On May
9, 2016, the Company received a staff determination letter from
Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with its
rules for continued listing, Rule 5635(b), because it violated the
shareholder approval requirement. The technical violation resulted
from the purchase of 1,834,862 shares of the Company s common
stock by Unterberg Technology Partners, L.P.
( Unterberg ) in December 2015, which when aggregated
with the common shares underlying the Company s Series B
Preferred Stock held by an affiliate of Unterberg in February 2016,
caused the amount owned by Unterberg affiliates to exceed the level
allowed by Nasdaq without a prior shareholder vote. The Nasdaq
letter indicated that the Company had forty-five (45) calendar days
to submit a plan to regain compliance.

Overview 

Our Business 

We offer a comprehensive suite of cloud voice, cloud connectivity,
cloud infrastructure, cloud computing and managed cloud-based
applications to businesses of all size, and offer domestic and
international VoIP services to carriers worldwide. Our advanced,
proprietary cloud services platforms, as well as our state-of-the
art switching systems, enable the integration of leading edge
solutions in the cloud, increasing customer collaboration and
productivity by seamlessly connecting employees, partners,
customers and vendors. We currently operate our business in two
distinct business segments: Business Services and Carrier
Services. 

In the Business Services segment, we are focused on becoming our
business customers  single source for leveraging the
increasing power of the cloud, providing a robust package of what
we believe to be the essential services that form the foundation
for their successful migration to, and efficient use of, the cloud.
Our core Business Services products and services include cloud
voice and unified communications as a service (UCaaS), improving
communication and collaboration on virtually any device, virtually
anywhere, and cloud connectivity services, securely and reliably
connecting customers to the cloud with managed network solutions
that are designed to increase quality and optimize network
efficiency. Our cloud computing and infrastructure as a service
(IaaS) solutions, are designed to provide our larger enterprise
customers with a platform on which additional cloud services can be
layered. Complemented by storage solutions, as well as software as
a service (SaaS) solutions, such as security and business
continuity, our advanced cloud offerings allow our larger
enterprise customers to experience the increased efficiencies and
agility delivered by the cloud. The Company s cloud-based
services are flexible, scalable and rapidly deployed, reducing our
customers  cost of ownership while increasing their
productivity. 

Through our Carrier Services segment, we have agreements with
approximately 370 carrier customers and vendors, through which we
sell domestic and international voice services to other carriers
throughout the world. Customers include U.S.-based carriers sending
voice traffic to international destinations, and foreign carriers
sending traffic to the U.S. and internationally. We also purchase
domestic and international voice services from many of our Carrier
Services customers. Our carrier-grade network, advanced switching
platform and interconnections with global carriers on six
continents also reduce the cost of global voice traffic and expand
service delivery capabilities for our Business Services
segment. 

We manage our business segments based on gross profit and gross
margin, which represents net revenue less the cost of revenue, and
on net profitability after excluding certain non-cash and
non-recurring items. The majority of our operations, engineering,
information systems and support personnel are assigned to either
the Business Services or Carrier Services business segment for

FUSION TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES 

We continue to increasingly focus our sales and marketing efforts
on developing vertically oriented solutions for targeted markets
that require the kind of specialized solutions made possible by our
state-of-the-art network and advanced services platforms. Our
vertically oriented solutions, which are currently focused on
healthcare, legal, hospitality and real estate, offer a substantial
opportunity to gain additional market share. We intend to
accelerate the growth of our Business Services segment with the
goal of increasing the portion of our total revenue derived from
this higher margin and more stable segment. In addition to lowering
the underlying costs of termination, we believe that our Carrier
Services segment supports the growth of the Business Services
segment by providing enhanced service offerings for business
customers and by strengthening its relationships with major service
providers throughout the world. 

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months
Ended September 30, 2015 

The
following table summarizes the results of our consolidated
operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015: 

*Exclusive
of depreciation and amortization, shown separately
below. 

Revenues 

Consolidated
revenues were $29.5 million during the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $24.5 million during the three months ended
September 30, 2015, an increase of $5.0 million, or
20.2%. 

Revenues
from the Business Services segment were $20.6 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $16.3 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase is
primarily attributable to revenue derived from new customers
obtained from our acquisitions of RootAxcess in September 2015 and
various Fidelity companies in December 2015.  

Carrier
Services revenue of approximately $8.9 million represents an
increase of $0.6 million, or 7.2%, from the same period a year
earlier. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 93% or
$0.03 in the blended rate per minute of traffic terminated from the
same period a year earlier, partially offset by a decrease of 44%
in the number of minutes of traffic carried during the
quarter.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin 

Consolidated
cost of revenues was $16.8 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to $13.5 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase was due
to costs attributable to revenues derived from the RootAxcess and
Fidelity acquisitions completed in the third and fourth quarter of
2015, and higher per minute rates for the cost of traffic
terminated of 99.7% (or $0.03 per minute) in the Carrier Services
segment.  

Consolidated gross margin was 43.1% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to 44.8% in the same period for 2015.
The decrease is primarily due to approximately $0.8 million of
additional costs of traffic terminated by our Carrier Services
segment and an increase of approximately $2.4 million in our
Business Services segment driven primarily by an increase in total
customer services costs as a result of the RootAxcess and Fidelity
acquisitions. 

Gross
margin for the Business Services segment was 59.9% for the three
months ending September 30, 2016 as compared to 63.8% for the three
months ending September 30, 2015.  The decrease is due
primarily to an increase in costs of revenue driven primarily by an
increase in lower margin connectivity services associated with
services offered by the acquired Fidelity
companies.  

Gross
margin for the Carrier Services segment was 4.3% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 7.6% in the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease was due to
higher cost per minute of traffic terminated of $0.8 million, over
the same period a year earlier.  

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization expense was $3.0 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.1 million in the same
period of 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
 amortization expense of
the intangible assets decreased by approximately $0.5 million from
the same period in 2015 as a result of some of the intangible
assets being fully amortized, and depreciation expense increased by
approximately $0.4 million.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $11.4 million as
compared to $9.8 million for the three months ended September 30,
2015.  This
increase is driven primarily by higher salaries and employee
related benefits of approximately $1.6 million due to increased
headcount resulting from our acquisitions of Fidelity, RootAxcess
and TFB.  

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was approximately $1.6 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.4 million in the
same period of 2015. The increase in interest expense of $0.2
million is due to an increase in interest expense of approximately
0.4 million from the credit facility with Opus Bank offset by a
decrease in interest expense of approximately $0.2 million from
Praesidian as a result of the debt restructuring in August 2015
which lower the interest rate from 11.5% to 10.8%. 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we
recognized a gain on the change in fair value of our derivative
liabilities in the amount of approximately $152,000 (see Notes 12
and 17) and $1.2 million, respectively.   The gain and loss on
the derivative are related to warrants that we issued to our senior
lenders in 2012 and 2013 and warrants issued to purchasers of our
Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the terms of which cause them to be
treated as liabilities and not as equity instruments. The changes
in their fair value are required to be recorded through the
statement of operations at each accounting period. These warrants
are valued using an option pricing model and other valuation
models, such that increases in Fusion s stock price result in
a higher valuation of the derivative and a charge to our income
statement, and decreases in Fusion s stock price result in a
lower valuation and a gain being recorded in our income
statement.  

We may be subject to additional fluctuations in our income
statement in 2016 and beyond based on changes in Fusion s
stock price and the corresponding changes in fair value of our
derivative liabilities associated with the warrants issued in
connection with our Series B-2 Preferred Stock.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2015 

The
following table summarizes the results of our consolidated
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015: 

*Exclusive
of depreciation and amortization, shown separately
below. 

Revenues 

Consolidated
revenues were $93.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to $74.9 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of $18.2 million, or 24.4%. 

Revenues
from the Business Services segment increased by $13.3 million for
the first nine months of 2016 to $62.4 million from $49.1 million
for the first nine months of 2015. The increase is primarily
attributable to revenue derived from new customers obtained from
the RootAxcess and Fidelity acquisitions which were completed in
the third and fourth quarter of 2015. 

Carrier
Services revenue of $30.7 million represents an increase of $4.9
million, or 19.2%, from the same period a year earlier. The
increase is the result of a 52.3% or $0.02 increase in the blended
rate per minute of traffic terminated offset by a decrease of 21.8%
in volume of traffic carried. 

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin 

Consolidated
cost of revenues was $53.9 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $41.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  This increase is due to
costs attributable to revenues resulting from the RootAxcess and
Fidelity acquisitions during the third and fourth quarter of 2015,
and higher per minute rates for the cost of traffic terminated of
59.3% (or $0.02 per minute) in the Carrier Services
segment.  

Consolidated
gross margin was 42.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to 44.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
 The
decrease is primarily due to an increase in costs of revenue driven
primarily by the inclusion of the Fidelity acquisition and an
increase in costs in our Carrier Services segment of $5.8 million
as a result of higher per minute rates associated with the cost of
traffic terminated.  

27 

FUSION TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES 

Gross
margin for the Business Services segment was 60.6% for the first
nine months of 2016 compared to 63.7% for the first nine months of
2015.  The
decrease is due primarily to an increase in costs of revenue driven
primarily by an increase in lower margin connectivity services
associated with services offered by the Fidelity
companies.  

Gross
margin for the Carrier Services business segment was 4.5% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 8.6% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease was due to
higher cost per minute of traffic terminated of $5.8 million, or
59.3%, over the same period a year earlier.  

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization expense was $8.9 million and $9.2 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016,  amortization expense of
the intangible assets decreased by approximately $1.5 million from
the same period a year earlier as a result of certain intangible
assets being fully amortized, and depreciation expense increased by
approximately $1.2 million from the same period a year
earlier.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

SG A
expenses increased by $4.7 million to $34.1 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 from $29.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase is
primarily driven by higher salaries and employee related benefits
of approximately $4.8 million due to increased headcount resulting
from our acquisitions of Fidelity, RootAxcess and
TFB.  

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was approximately $4.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and $4.7 million for the same period in
2015. The increase in interest expense of approximately $0.2
million is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of
approximately 1.4 million from the credit facility with Opus Bank
offset by a decrease in interest expense of approximately $0.9
million from Praesidian as a result of the debt restructuring in
August 2015 which lower the interest rate from 11.5% to 10.8% and
resulted in a reduction in the amortization of debt discount and
debt issuance costs of approximately $0.4 million. 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 

The
change in fair value of the derivative was a gain of $380,000 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $2.5
million the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This change is
due to the decrease in Fusion's stock price during these periods,
which decreases the value of our derivative liability. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since our inception, we have incurred significant net losses. At
September 30, 2016, we had working capital deficit of approximately
$3.2 million and stockholders  equity of $7.0 million. At
December 31, 2015, we had working capital of $1.7 million and
stockholders  equity of approximately $14.5 million. Our
consolidated cash balance at September 30, 2016 was approximately
$0.9 million as compared to $7.5 million at December 31, 2015.
While we believe we have sufficient cash to fund our operations and
meet our operating and debt obligations for the next twelve months,
we may be required to raise additional capital to support our
business plan. There can be no assurances that such funds will be
available to the Company as and when needed or on terms deemed by
us to be acceptable. 

We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we do
not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the
foreseeable future. We intend to retain all of our earnings, if
any, for general corporate purposes, and, if appropriate, to
finance the expansion of our business. Subject to the rights of
holders of our outstanding preferred stock, any future
determination to pay dividends is at the discretion of
Fusion s Board, and will be dependent upon our financial
condition, operating results, capital requirements, general
business conditions, the terms of our credit facilities,
limitations under Delaware law and other factors that
Fusion s Board and senior management consider
appropriate. 

The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive
cumulative dividends of 8% per annum payable in arrears, as and if
declared by Fusion s Board. The holders of our Series B-2
Preferred Stock are entitled to receive quarterly dividends at an
annual rate of 6%. These dividends can be paid, at the
Company s option, either in cash or, under certain
circumstances, in shares of Fusion s common
stock. 

28 

FUSION TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES 

Through September 30, 2016, Fusion s Board has never declared
dividends on any series of the Series A Preferred Stock, and, as a
result, the Company had accumulated approximately $4.6 million of
preferred stock dividends. The Fusion Board declared a dividend of
$183,917 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 on its
Series B-2 Preferred Stock, which, as permitted by the terms of the
Series B-2 Preferred Stock, was paid in the form of 122,601 shares
of Fusion s common stock. 

Secured Credit Facility 

In December 2015, the Company entered into the Opus Facility, which
facility amended and restated, in its entirety, the $40.0 million
credit facility originally entered into by the Company with Opus
Bank in August 2015. The Opus Facility consists of a $15.0 million
revolving credit facility and a $25.0 million term loan. All
borrowings under the Opus Facility bear interest at a rate equal to
the higher of (a) the rate of interest in effect for such day as
publicly announced from time to time by the Wall Street Journal as
its  prime rate  (or the average prime rate if a high
and a low prime rate are therein reported) plus the Applicable
Margin then in effect at such time, or (b) 3.25% plus the
Applicable Margin and are secured by a first priority security
interest in all of the assets of Fusion and its subsidiaries,
including the capital stock of each such subsidiary. Under the Opus
Facility,  Applicable Margin  is calculated based on
the ratio of Senior Indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA (each as
defined in the Opus Facility) and ranges from 1.25% to 2.00% based
on the ratio level. In addition, subject to certain limitations,
Fusion and certain of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the
obligations of the borrower (Fusion NBS Acquisition Corp.) under
the Opus Facility, including its obligations to repay all
borrowings. The maturity date of amounts borrowed under the
revolver is four years or August 28, 2019, and the maturity date of
any amounts borrowed under the term loan portion of this facility
is August 28, 2020. The Opus Facility contains a number of
affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to,
restrictions on paying indebtedness subordinate to borrowings under
the Opus Facility, incurring additional indebtedness, making
capital expenditures, dividend payments and cash distributions by
subsidiaries. The Opus Facility also requires on-going compliance
with various financial covenants, including a maximum senior
leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum levels of
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Effective December 31, 2015, the Company s obligation to
maintain a minimum unencumbered cash bank balance of no less than
$1.0 million at all times was eliminated. 

At September 30, 2016, we have outstanding $15.0 million under the
revolver and $25.0 million under the term loan. The Company paid
monthly interest at a rate of 4.75%, and paid interest expense of
approximately $0.5 million and $1.4 million during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. As of September
30, 2016, we were not in compliance with our leverage and senior
leverage ratio covenants in the Opus Facility.   On
November 7, 2016,  the Company and Opus Bank entered into a
Waiver and Amendment to Amended and Restated credit Agreement
( Amended Opus Facility ) whereby Opus agreed to waive
our default with respect to the leverage and senior leverage ratios
covenant requirements, and refinance the existing credit facility
into a new $20.0 million senior secured credit facility with East
West Bank. As a result of this waiver, we were in compliance with
our obligations under the Secured Credit Facility as of September
30, 2016. 

Praesidian Facility 

Simultaneous with the execution of the Opus Facility, the Company
executed the Fourth Amended SPA. The Fourth Amended SPA amended and
restated the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Securities
Purchase Agreement and Security Agreement (the  Third
Amendment ). Specifically, the Fourth Amended SPA amended the
Third Amendment to (i) provide the consent of the continuing
lenders to the acquisition of Fidelity (ii) add Fidelity as a
guarantor and credit party under the Praesidian Facility, and (iii)
modify or eliminate certain of the financial covenants contained in
the Third Amendment, including the requirement to maintain a
minimum unencumbered cash bank balance of $1.0 million at all
times. As of September 30, 2016, we were not in compliance with our
leverage ratio covenant in the Fourth Amended SPA. 
 On November
7, 2016, Praesidian waived our events of default with respect to
non-compliance with the leverage ratio. As a result of this waiver
and amendment, we were in compliance with our obligations under
the   Fourth Amended SPA 
 as of
September 30, 2016.  

The following notes have been issued by us under the Praesidian
Facility: 

Series A and B Notes . The Company sold $6.5 million
aggregate principal amount of Series A notes, and $10.0 million
aggregate principal amount of Series B notes in October 2012, the
proceeds of which were used to finance our acquisition of Network
Billing Systems, LLC. 

Series C and D Notes.  The Company sold $0.5 million
aggregate principal amount of Series C notes and $25.0 million
aggregate principal amount of Series D notes in December 2013, to
finance our acquisition of certain assets of Broadvox. 

Series E Notes.  The Company sold $5.0 million aggregate
principal amount of Series E notes in October 2014 to fund our
acquisition of PingTone Communications Inc. 

29 

FUSION TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES 

Series F Notes.  The Company sold $9.0 million aggregate
principal amount of Series F notes in August 2015 to retire a
portion of the approximately $20.0 million of notes held by one of
the original lenders. 

At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $34.0 million principal
amount of notes outstanding under the Praesidian Facility. In
accordance with the terms of the Fourth Amended SPA, the notes bear
interest at an annual rate of 10.8%, with monthly principal
payments of approximately $57,148 with the outstanding principal
balance on all the notes payable at maturity on February 28,
2021. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid
interest expense on the notes of approximately $0.9 million and
$1.1 million, respectively, and $2.8 million and $3.7 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Related Party Note Payable 

We have a note payable outstanding of approximately $1.2 million to
Marvin Rosen, the Chairman of Fusion s Board. This note is
subordinated to all amounts borrowed under the Opus Facility and
the Praesidian Facility. This note is unsecured, pays interest
monthly at an annual rate of 7%, and matures 120 days after all
borrowings under the Opus Facility and the Praesidian Facility are
paid in full. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recognized interest expense of approximately $21,300. 

We have entered into various capital lease agreements to finance
the purchase of property and equipment, at interest rates generally
ranging from 5.3% to 6.6%. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we paid $743,647 scheduled principal payments under these
leases and approximately $129,000 in interest expense. 

The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the
periods indicated: 

Cash used in operating activities was $1.9 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to cash provided by
operating activities of $0.1 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

The following table illustrates the primary components of our cash
flows from operations: 

Cash used in investing activities, comprised mainly of capital
expenditures, was $3.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to $2.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016
are expected to be approximately $0.7 million to fund the purchase
of network and related equipment and operational support systems as
we continue to grow our Business Services segment. A portion of our
capital expenditure requirements may be financed through capital
leases or other equipment financing arrangements. 

30 

FUSION TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES 

Cash used in financing activities was $1.6 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and $0.6 million for the same
period in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
use of cash was the result of debt service payments and equipment
financing obligations of $824,973 and $743,647 respectively. Cash
used in financing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 of approximately $0.6 million was primarily attributable
to payments of $0.8 million to our senior lenders, retirement of
debt of approximately $20.0 million, $0.6 million in capital lease
payments, and approximately $1.7 million repayment of borrowings
under a factoring arrangement with a third party, offset by
approximately $1.6 million in proceeds received from the transfer
of receivables from such third party. In addition, during the
quarter ended September 30, 2015, we issued the Series F Notes for
$9.0 million under the Praesidian Facility and borrowed $12.5
million under the Secured Credit Facility. 

Other Matters 

Inflation 

We do
not believe inflation has a significant effect on our operations at
this time. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At September 30, 2016, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future
effect on the Company s financial condition, revenues or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources that are material to investors. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk. 

Disclosure
under this section is not required for a smaller reporting
company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based upon that
evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their
objectives. 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer do not
expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will
prevent all error and all fraud. The design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the
benefit of   controls must be considered
relative to their cost. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls   can provide absolute assurance
that we have detected all of our control issues and all instances
of fraud, if any. The design of any     system of controls also is based
partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving our stated goals under all potential future
conditions.  

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

 2016 FUSION EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

Blueprint 

EXHIBIT
10.58 

FUSION TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC 

2016 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 

EFFECTIVE DATE: October 28, 2016 

APPROVED BY STOCKHOLDERS: October 28, 2016 

TERMINATION DATE: October 27, 2026 

ARTICLE 1 

Establishment, Purpose, Effective Date, Expiration
Date 

1.1             Establishment  .   Fusion
Telecommunications International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
  Company  ), hereby
establishes the Fusion Telecommunications International, Inc. 2016
Equity Incentive Plan (the   Plan  ). The Plan will
supersede and replace the Fusion Telecommunications International,
Inc. 2009 Stock Option Plan, effective as of December 2009 (the
  2009
Plan  ). No awards will be made pursuant to the 2009
Plan on or after the Effective Date; provided, however, that the
2009 Plan shall remain in effect until all awards granted under the
2009 Plan have been exercised, forfeited, canceled, expired or
otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of such
grants. 

1.2             Purpose  .  The
purpose of the Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and
its stockholders by enhancing the Company s ability to
attract and retain qualified persons to perform services for the
Company, by providing incentives to such persons to put forth
maximum efforts for the Company and by rewarding persons who
contribute to the achievement of the Company s economic
objectives. To further these objectives, the Plan provides for the
grant of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock,
Restricted Stock Units, Stock Grants, Stock Units, Performance
Shares, Performance Share Units, and Performance Cash. The Plan
also permits the grant of Awards that qualify for the
 performance-based compensation  exception to the
limitations on the deduction of compensation imposed by Section
162(m) of the Code. At the same time, the Plan permits the
Committee, in the exercise of its discretion, to grant Awards to
Covered Employees that do not qualify for the
 performance-based compensation 
exception. 

1.3             Effective
Date  .  The Plan will
become effective on the date it is approved by the stockholders at
the Company s 2016 Annual Meeting (the   Effective
Date  ). 

1.4             Expiration
Date  .  The Plan
will expire on, and no Award may be granted under the Plan after,
the tenth (10 th ) anniversary
of the Effective Date (the   Expiration Date  ). Any
Awards that are outstanding on the Expiration Date shall remain in
force according to the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award
Agreement. 

ARTICLE 2 

Glossary; Construction 

2.1             Glossary  .  When
a word or phrase appears in this Plan document with the initial
letter capitalized, and the word or phrase does not commence a
sentence, the word or phrase will generally be given the meaning
ascribed to it in  Article
1  or in the attached Glossary, which is incorporated into
and is part of the Plan. All of these key terms are listed in the
Glossary. Whenever these key terms are used, they will be given the
defined meaning unless a clearly different meaning is required by
the context. 

2.2             Construction  . 
The masculine gender, where appearing in the Plan, shall include
the feminine gender (and vice versa), and the singular shall
include the plural, unless the context clearly indicates to the
contrary. If any provision of this Plan is determined to be for any
reason invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
continue in full force and effect. 

1 

ARTICLE 3 

Eligibility and Participation 

3.1             General
Eligibility  .  Persons
eligible to participate in this Plan include all employees,
officers, Non-Employee Directors of, and Consultants to, the
Company or any Affiliate. Awards may also be granted to prospective
employees or Non-Employee Directors but no portion of any such
Award will vest, become exercisable, be issued, or become effective
prior to the date on which such individual begins to provide
services to the Company or its Affiliates. 

3.2             Actual
Participation  .  Subject to the provisions of the
Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, select from among all
eligible individuals, those to whom Awards will be granted and will
determine the nature and amount of each Award. 

ARTICLE 4 

Administration 

4.1             General  .  The
Plan shall be administered by the Committee or, with respect to
individuals who are Non-Employee Directors, the Board. All
references in the Plan to the   Committee   shall refer to
the Committee or Board, as applicable. The Committee, by majority
action thereof, is authorized to interpret the Plan, to prescribe,
amend, and rescind rules and regulations as it may deem necessary
or advisable to administer the Plan, to provide for conditions and
assurances deemed necessary or advisable to protect the interests
of the Company, and to make all other determinations necessary or
advisable for the administration of the Plan, but only to the
extent not contrary to the express provisions of the Plan.
Determinations, interpretations, or other actions made or taken by
the Committee in good faith pursuant to the provisions of the Plan
shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of the
Plan. 

4.2             Committee
Responsibilities  . 
Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the
authority to: (a) designate the Participants who are entitled to
receive Awards under the Plan; (b) determine the types of Awards
and the times when Awards will be granted; (c) determine the number
of Awards to be granted and the number of shares of Stock to which
an Award will relate; (d) determine the terms and conditions of any
Award, including, but not limited to, the purchase price or
exercise price or base value, the grant price, the period(s) during
which such Awards shall be exercisable (whether in whole or in
part); (e) any restrictions or limitations on the Award, any
schedule for lapse of restrictions or limitations, and
accelerations or waivers thereof, based in each case on such
considerations as the Committee determines; provided, however, that
except in the case of a Change in Control, the Committee shall not
have the authority to accelerate the vesting or waive the
forfeiture restrictions on any Performance-Based Award; (f)
determine whether, to what extent, and in what circumstances an
Award may be settled in, or the exercise price or purchase price of
an Award may be paid in cash, Stock, or other Awards, or other
property, or whether an Award may be canceled, forfeited, exchanged
or surrendered; (g) prescribe the form of each Award Agreement,
which need not be the same for each Participant; (h) decide all
other matters that must be determined in connection with an Award;
(i) interpret the terms of, and determine any matter arising
pursuant to, the Plan or any Award Agreement; and (j) make all
other decisions or determinations that may be required pursuant to
the Plan or an Award Agreement as the Committee deems necessary or
advisable to administer the Plan. The Committee shall also have the
authority to modify existing Awards to the extent that such
modification is within the power and authority of the Committee as
set forth in the Plan. 

4.3             Decisions
Final  .  The Committee
shall have the authority to interpret the Plan and subject to the
provisions of the Plan, any Award Agreement, and all decisions and
determinations by the Committee with respect to the Plan are final,
binding and conclusive on all parties. No member of the Committee
shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith
with respect to the Plan or any Award granted under the
Plan. 

2 

ARTICLE 5 

Shares Available for Grant 

5.1             Number
of Shares  .   Subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 5.4, the aggregate number of shares of Stock
reserved and available for grant pursuant to the Plan shall be an
amount equal to ten percent (10%) of our shares of common stock
outstanding from time-to-time on a fully-diluted basis,
plus shares from any award granted under the 2009 Plan that
terminates, expires or lapses for any reason in the future. In
addition, the 101,749 shares not granted under the 2009 Plan will
be available for grant under this Plan. The shares of Stock
delivered pursuant to any Award may consist, in whole or in part,
of authorized by unissued Stock, treasury Stock not reserved for
any other purposes, or Stock purchased on the open
market. 

5.2             Share
Counting  .  The
following rules shall apply solely for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Stock available for grant under the Plan at any
given time: 

(a)           In
the event any Award granted under the Plan, or any award
outstanding under the 2009 Plan after the Effective Date is
terminated, expired, forfeited, or canceled for any reason, the
number of shares of Stock subject to such Award will again be
available for grant under the Plan (i.e., any prior charge against
the limit set forth in Section 5.1 shall be reversed). 

(b)           If
shares of Stock are not delivered in connection with an Award
because the Award may only be settled in cash rather than in Stock,
no shares of Stock shall be counted against the limit set forth in
Section 5.1. If any Award may be settled in cash or Stock, the
rules set forth in Section 5.2(a) shall apply until the Award is
settled, at which time the underlying shares of Stock will be added
back to the shares available for grant pursuant to Section 5.1 but
only if the Award is settled in cash. 

(c)           The
exercise of a stock-settled SAR or broker-assisted
 cashless  exercise of an Option (or a portion thereof)
will reduce the number of shares available for grant under Section
5.1 by the entire number of shares of Stock subject to that SAR or
Option (or applicable portion thereof), even though a smaller
number of shares of Stock will be issued upon such an
exercise. 

(d)           Shares
of Stock tendered to pay the exercise price of an Option or
tendered, withheld or otherwise relinquished by a Participant to
satisfy a tax withholding obligation arising in connection with an
Award will not again become Stock available for grant under the
Plan. Moreover, shares of Stock purchased on the open market with
cash proceeds generated by the exercise of an Option will not
increase or replenish the number of shares available for grant
under Section 5.1. 

(e)           If
the provisions of this Section 5.2 are inconsistent with the
requirements of any regulations issued pursuant to Section 422 of
the Code, the provisions of such regulations shall control over the
provisions of this Section 5.2, but only as this Section 5.2
relates to Incentive Stock Options. 

(f)           The
Committee may adopt such other reasonable rules and procedures as
it deems to be appropriate for determining the number of shares of
Stock that are available for grant under Section 5.1. 

5.3             Award
Limits  . 
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, and subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 5.4: 

(a)           The
maximum number of shares of Stock that may be issued as Incentive
Stock Options under the Plan shall be the same numeric limit set
forth in Section 5.1. 

(b)           The
maximum number of shares of Stock that may be granted to any one
Participant during any 12-month period with respect to one or more
Awards shall be 1,000,000. 

3 

(c)           The
maximum Performance Cash Award payable for any 12-month Performance
Period to any one Participant is $1,000,000. If the Performance
Period exceeds 12 months, the dollar limit expressed in the
preceding sentence shall be reduced or increased
proportionately. 

(d)           The
aggregate Grant Date Fair Market Value of Awards granted to any one
Participant who is a Non-Employee Director during any one 12-month
period with respect to one or more Awards shall be
$500,000. 

5.4             Adjustments
in Capitalization  .  In
the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Stock by
reason of a Stock dividend or split, recapitalization, liquidation,
merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, or other
similar corporate change, the Committee shall make a proportionate
adjustment in: (a) the number and class of shares of Stock made
available for grant pursuant to Section 5.1; (b) the number of
shares of Stock set forth in Section 5.3, 11.9, and any other
similar numeric limit expressed in the Plan; (c) the number and
class of and/or price of shares of Stock subject to then
outstanding Awards; (d) subject to the limitations imposed on
Performance-Based Awards, the performance targets or other goals
applicable to any outstanding Awards; or (e) any other terms of an
Award that are affected by the event. Moreover, in the event of
such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion may
provide in substitution for any or all outstanding awards under the
Plan such alternative consideration (including cash) as it, in good
faith, may determine to be equitable under the circumstances and
may require in connection therewith the surrender of all Awards so
replaced. Any action taken pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be
taken in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code and, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, in
accordance with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code. 

5.5             Replacement
Awards  .  In the event
of any corporate transaction in which the Company or an Affiliate
acquires a corporate entity which, at the time of such transaction,
maintains an equity compensation plan pursuant to which awards of
stock options, SARs, restricted stock, or any other form of equity
based compensation are then outstanding (the   Acquired Plan  ), the
Committee may make Awards to assume, substitute or convert such
outstanding awards in such manner as may be determined to be
appropriate and equitable by the Committee; provided, however, that
the number of shares of Stock subject to any Award shall always be
a whole number by rounding any fractional share to the nearest
whole share. Options or SARs issued pursuant to this Section 5.5
shall not be subject to the requirement that the exercise price of
such Award not be less than the Fair Market Value of Stock on the
date the Award is granted. Shares used in connection with an Award
granted in substitution for an award outstanding under an Acquired
Plan under this Section 5.5 shall not be counted against the number
of shares of Stock available for grant under Section 5.1. Any
shares of Stock authorized and available for issuance under the
Acquired Plan shall, subject to adjustment as described in Section
5.4, be available for use in making Awards under this Plan with
respect to persons eligible under such Acquired Plan, by virtue of
the Company s assumption of such Acquired Plan, consistent
with Nasdaq Listing Rules (or rules of any other exchange upon
which the Stock is then traded), as such rules may be amended or
replaced from time to time. 

5.6             Fractional
Shares  .  No fractional
shares of Stock shall be issued pursuant to the Plan. Unless the
Committee specifies otherwise in the Award Agreement, or pursuant
to any policy adopted by the Committee, cash will be given in lieu
of fractional shares. In the event of adjustment as provided in
Section 5.4 or the issuance of replacement awards as provided in
Section 5.5, the total number of shares of Stock subject to any
affected Award shall always be a whole number by rounding any
fractional share to the nearest whole share. 

ARTICLE 6 

Stock Options 

6.1             Options  . 
Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at
any time and from time to time, may grant Options to one or more
Participants upon such terms and conditions and in such amounts, as
shall be determined by the Committee. Options are also subject to
the following additional terms and conditions: 

(a)            Exercise
Price  .   No
Option shall be granted at an exercise price that is less than the
Fair Market Value of one share of Stock on the Grant
Date. 

4 

(b)            Exercise
of Option  .   Options shall be
exercisable at such times and in such manner, and shall be subject
to such restrictions or conditions, as the Committee shall in each
instance approve, which need not be the same for each grant or for
each Participant. 

(c)            Term
of Option  .  Each
Option shall expire at such time as determined by the Committee;
provided, however, that no Option shall be exercisable later than
the tenth (10th) anniversary the Grant Date. 

(d)            Payment  .   The
exercise price for any Option shall be paid in cash or shares of
Stock held for longer than six (6) months (through actual tender or
by attestation). In the Award Agreement, the Committee also may
prescribe other methods by which the exercise price of an Option
may be paid and the form of payment including, without limitation,
any net-issuance arrangement or other property acceptable to the
Committee (including broker-assisted  cashless
exercise  arrangements), and the methods by which shares of
Stock shall be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants.
The Committee, in consideration of applicable accounting standards
and applicable law, may waive the six (6) month share holding
period described in the first sentence of this paragraph (d) in the
event payment of an Option is made through the tendering of
shares. 

(e)            Repricing
of Options  .   Notwithstanding any other
provision in the Plan to the contrary, without approval of the
Company s stockholders, an Option may not be amended,
modified or repriced to reduce the exercise price after the Grant
Date. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.4 with respect to
an adjustment in capitalization, an Option also may not be
surrendered in consideration of a new Option having an exercise
price below the exercise price of the Option being surrendered or
exchanged. 

(f)            Nontransferability
of Options  .  No Option
may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated
or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution. Further, all Options granted to a Participant shall
be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant
or his or her legal representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Committee may, in its discretion, permit the transfer of an
Option to a Family Member, trust or partnership, or to a charitable
organization, provided that no value or consideration is received
by the Participant with respect to such transfer. 

6.2             Incentive
Stock Options  . 
Incentive Stock Options shall be granted only to Participants who
are employees and the terms of any Incentive Stock Options granted
pursuant to the Plan must comply with the following additional
provisions of this Section 6.2: 

(a)            Exercise
Price  .  Subject to
Section 6.2(e), the exercise price per share of Stock pursuant to
any Incentive Stock Option shall be set by the Committee, provided
that the exercise price for any Incentive Stock Option shall not be
less than the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock as of the
Grant Date. 

(b)            Term
of Incentive Stock Option  .   In no event may any
Incentive Stock Option be exercisable for more than ten (10) years
from the Grant Date. 

(c)            Lapse
of Option  .  An
Incentive Stock Option shall lapse in the following
circumstances: 

(1)           The
Incentive Stock Option shall lapse ten (10) years from the Grant
Date, unless an earlier time is set in the Award
Agreement; 

(2)           The
Incentive Stock Option shall lapse upon a Termination of Employment
for any reason other than the Participant s death or
Disability, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement;
and 

(3)           If
the Participant incurs a Termination of Employment on account of
Disability or death before the Option lapses pursuant to paragraph
(i) or (ii) above, the Incentive Stock Option shall lapse, unless
it is previously exercised, on the earlier of: (a) the scheduled
termination date of the Option; or (b) twelve months after the date
of the Participant s Termination of Employment on account of
death or Disability. Upon the Participant s death or
Disability, any Incentive Stock Options exercisable at the
Participant s death or Disability may be exercised by the
Participant s legal representative or representatives, by the
person or persons entitled to do so pursuant to the
Participant s last will and testament, or, if the Participant
fails to make testamentary disposition of such Incentive Stock
Option or dies intestate, by the person or persons entitled to
receive the Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the applicable laws
of descent and distribution. 

5 

(d)            Individual
Dollar Limitation  .   The aggregate Fair Market
Value (determined as of the time an Award is made) of all shares of
Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are first
exercisable by a Participant in any calendar year may not exceed
$100,000 or such other limitation as imposed by Section 422(d) of
the Code, or any successor provision. To the extent that Incentive
Stock Options are first exercisable by a Participant in excess of
such limitation, the excess shall be considered Non-Qualified Stock
Options. 

(e)            Ten
Percent Owners  .   An Incentive Stock Option
may be granted to any individual who, at the Grant Date, owns stock
possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting
power of all classes of Stock of the Company only if such Option is
granted at a price that is not less than 110% of Fair Market Value
on the Grant Date and the Option is exercisable for no more than
five (5) years from the Grant Date. 

(f)            Right
to Exercise  .  Except
as provided in Section 6.2(c)(iii), an Incentive Stock Option may
be exercised only by the Participant during the Participant s
lifetime. 

(g)            Limitation
on Number of Shares Subject to Awards  .   In accordance with Section
5.3(a), but subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.4, the
maximum number of shares of Stock that may be issued as Incentive
Stock Options under the Plan shall be the same numeric limit set
forth in Section 5.1. 

ARTICLE 7 

Stock Appreciation Rights 

7.1             Stock
Appreciation Rights.   Subject to the terms and
provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at any time and from time to
time, may grant SARs to one or more Participants upon such terms
and conditions and in such amounts, as shall be determined by the
Committee. SARs may be granted in connection with the grant of an
Option, in which case the exercise of such SARs will result in the
surrender of the right to purchase the shares under the Option as
to which the SARs were exercised. When SARs are granted in
connection an Incentive Stock Option, the SARs shall have such
terms and conditions as shall be required by Section 422 of the
Code. Alternatively, SARs may be granted independently of Options.
SARs are also subject to the following additional terms and
conditions: 

(a)            Base
Value  .   No
SAR shall be granted at a base value that is less than the Fair
Market Value of one share of Stock on the Grant Date. 

(b)            Exercise
of SARs  .   SARs shall be exercisable
at such times and be subject to such restrictions and conditions as
the Committee shall, in each instance approve, which need not be
the same for all Participants. 

(c)            Term
of SARs  .  Each SAR
shall expire at such time as determined by the Committee; provided,
however, that no SAR shall be exercisable later than the tenth
(10th) anniversary the Grant Date. 

(d)            Payment
of SAR Amount  .  Upon
the exercise of a SAR, the Participant shall be entitled to receive
the payment of an amount determined by multiplying: (i) the excess,
if any, of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of
exercise, over the base value fixed by the Committee on the Grant
Date; by (ii) the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is
exercised. Payment for SARs shall be made in manner and at the time
specified by the Committee in the Award Agreement. At the
discretion of the Committee, the Award Agreement may provide for
payment of SARs in cash, shares of Stock of equivalent value, or in
a combination thereof.  

(e)            Repricing
of SARs  .    Notwithstanding any
other provision in the Plan to the contrary, without approval of
the Company s stockholders, a SAR may not be amended,
modified or repriced to reduce the base value after the Grant Date.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.4 with respect to an
adjustment in capitalization, a SAR also may not be surrendered in
consideration of or exchanged for cash, other Awards or a new SAR
having a base value below the base value of the SAR being
surrendered or exchanged. 

6 

(f)            Nontransferability
of SARs  .  No SAR may
be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or
hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution. Further, all SARs granted to a Participant shall be
exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant or
his or her legal representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Committee may, in its discretion, permit the transfer of a SAR to a
Family Member, trust or partnership, or to a charitable
organization, provided that no value or consideration is received
by the Participant with respect to such transfer.

the Committee may impose, which need not be the same for each grant
or for each Participant. These restrictions may lapse separately or
in combination at such times, in such circumstances, in such
installments, or otherwise, as determined by the
Committee.    

(b)            Forfeiture  . 
Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, upon a

to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at any time
and from time to time, may grant Performance Share Units to one or
more Participants upon such terms and conditions, and in such
amounts, as shall be determined by the Committee. A Performance

the Performance Criteria selected by the Committee and designated
in the Award Agreement. The Performance Criteria applicable to any
Performance Share, Performance Share Unit or Performance Cash Award
granted to a Covered Employee that is designated as, or deemed to
be, a Performance-Based Award pursuant to Section 11 shall be
limited to the Performance Criteria specifically listed in the
Glossary. The Performance Criteria applicable to any other
Performance Share, Performance Share Unit or Performance Cash Award
shall include the Performance Criteria specifically listed in the
Glossary and such other criteria or factors as may be determined by
the Committee and specified in the Award Agreement. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 11 with respect to Performance-Based
Awards to Covered Employees, the Committee shall retain the power

10. 

8 

ARTICLE 11 

Performance-Based Awards 

11.1             Purpose  .   Section
162(m) of the Code limits the amount of the Company s
deductions for compensation payable to Covered Employees to
$1,000,000 per year.  Performance-based compensation 
that meets the requirements set forth in Section 162(m) of the Code
is not subject to this limitation. The purpose of this Section 11
is to enable the Committee to qualify some or all of the Awards
granted pursuant to Sections 8 and 10 as  performance-based
compensation  pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code. If the
Committee decides that a particular Award to a Covered Employee
should qualify as  performance-based compensation,  the
Committee will provide in the Award Agreement or otherwise that the
Award is intended to be a Performance-Based Award. 

11.2             Applicability  . 
This Section 11 shall apply only to Performance-Based Awards. If
this Section 11 applies, its provisions control over any contrary
provision contained in any other section of this Plan or any Award
Agreement. The provisions of this Section 11 and any Award
Agreement for a Performance-Based Award shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the
Code. If any provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement for a
Performance-Based Award does not comply with or is inconsistent
with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, such provision
shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to
conform to such requirements. 

11.3             Committee
Discretion with Respect to Performance-Based
Awards  .  With regard
to a particular Performance Period, the Committee shall have full
discretion to select the length of the Performance Period, the type
of Performance-Based Awards to be issued, the kind and/or level of
the Performance Goal or Goals and whether the Performance Goal or
Goals apply to the Company or an Affiliate or any division or
business unit thereof or the Participant or any group of
Participants. Depending on the Performance Criteria used to
establish the Performance Goals, the Performance Goals may be
stated in terms of absolute levels or relative to another company
or to an index or indices. 

11.4             Establishment
of Performance Goals  . 
A Performance-Based Award shall provide for payment only upon the
attainment of one or more pre-established, objective Performance
Goals. The Performance Goals, and the process by which they are
established, shall satisfy all of the requirements of Section
162(m) of the Code. By way of illustration, but not limitation, the
following requirements must be satisfied: 

(a)           The
Performance Goals shall be based solely on the Performance Criteria
specifically identified in the Glossary; 

(b)           The
Performance Goals shall be considered to be pre-established only if
the Performance Goals are established by the Committee in writing
not later than 90 days after the commencement of the Performance
Period for such Award provided that: (i) the outcome must be
substantially uncertain at the time the Committee establishes the
Performance Goals; and (ii) in no event may the Committee establish
the Performance Goals for any Performance-Based Award after 25% of
the Performance Period for such Award has elapsed; 

(c)           A
Performance Goal will be considered to be objective only if a third
party having knowledge of the relevant facts could determine
whether the Performance Goal has been met; 

(d)           The
Performance Goal must state, in terms of an objective formula or
standard, the method for computing the amount of compensation
payable to the Covered Employee if the Goal is attained. For this
purpose, the formula will be considered to be objective only if a
third party having knowledge of the relevant performance results
could calculate the amount to be paid to the Covered Employee;
and 

9 

(e)           The
objective formula or standard must preclude discretion to increase
the amount of compensation payable that would otherwise be due upon
attainment of the Performance Goal. 

11.5             Performance
Evaluation; Adjustment of Goals  .  At the time a Performance-Based Award
is first issued, the Committee, in the Award Agreement or in
another written document, shall specify whether performance will be
evaluated including or excluding the effect of any of the following
events that occur during the Performance Period, as the Committee
deems appropriate: (a) judgments entered or settlements reached in
litigation or regulator proceedings; (b) the write down or sale of
assets; (c) the impact of any reorganization or restructuring; (d)
the impact of changes in tax laws, accounting principles,
regulatory actions or other laws affecting reported results; (e)
items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring as
described in Accounting Standards Update 2015-01 and/or in
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations appearing in the Company s annual
report to stockholders or Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the case
may be, for the applicable year; (f) the impact of any mergers,
acquisitions, spin-offs or other divestitures; and (g) foreign
exchange gains and losses. 

The
inclusion or exclusion of these items shall be expressed in a form
that satisfies the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. The
Committee, in its discretion, also may, within the time prescribed
by Section 162(m) of the Code, adjust or modify the calculation of
Performance Goals for such Performance Period in order to prevent
the dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants: (i) in
the event of, or in anticipation of, any unusual or extraordinary
corporate item, transaction, event, or development; or (ii) in
recognition of, or in anticipation of, any other unusual or
nonrecurring events affecting the Company, or the financial
statements of the Company, or in response to, or in anticipation
of, changes in applicable laws, regulations, accounting principles,
or business conditions. 

11.6             Adjustment
of Performance-Based Awards  .  Notwithstanding any provision herein
to the contrary, the Committee may not make any adjustment or take
any other action with respect to any Performance-Based Award that
will increase the amount payable under any such Award. The
Committee shall retain the sole discretion to adjust
Performance-Based Awards downward or to otherwise reduce the amount
payable with respect to any Performance-Based Award. 

11.7             Continued
Employment Required  . 
Unless otherwise provided in the relevant Award Agreement or in the
case of a Change in Control, a Participant must be an employee of
the Company or an Affiliate on the day a Performance-Based Award
for such Performance Period is paid to the
Participant. 

11.8             Certification
By Committee  . 
Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, the payment of a
Performance-Based Award shall not occur until the Committee
certifies, in writing, that the pre-established Performance Goals
and any other material terms and conditions precedent to such
payment have been satisfied. Committee certification is not
required for compensation that is attributable solely to the
increase in the value of the Company s Stock. 

11.9             Maximum
Award Payable  .  In
accordance with Section 5.3, but subject to adjustment as provided
in Section 5.4, the maximum Performance-Based Award (other than a
Performance Cash Award of Performance Share Unit Award payable in
cash) payable to any one participant for any 12-month Performance
Period is 1,000,000 shares of Stock or the equivalent cash
value. The maximum Performance Cash Award (or Performance Share
Unit Award payable in cash) payable to any one Participant for any
12-month Performance Period is $1,000,000. If the Performance
Period exceeds 12 months, the dollar and share limits expressed in
the preceding sentences shall be reduced or increased
proportionately, as the case may be. For example, if the
Performance Period is three (3) years, the limit shall be increased
by multiplying it by three. 

11.10             Miscellaneous  . 
The designation of a Covered Employee as a Participant for any
Performance Period shall not in any manner entitle the Participant
to receive a Performance-Based Award for such Performance Period.
Moreover, designation of a Covered Employee as a Participant for a
particular Performance Period shall not require designation of such
Covered Employee as a Participant for any subsequent Performance
Period.

ARTICLE 12 

Change in Control 

12.1             Vesting  . 
If so specified by the Committee at the time of the grant of an
Award, such Award shall become fully vested and exercisable and all
restrictions on such Awards shall lapse if, following a Change in
Control, the Participant s employment is
terminated without Cause or Participant resigns for Good
Reason. To the extent that this provision causes Incentive Stock
Options to exceed the dollar limitation set forth in Section 422(d)
of the Code or any successor provision, the excess Options shall be
deemed to be Non-Qualified Stock Options. 

12.2             Participant
Consent Not Required  . 
Nothing in this Section 12 or any other provision of this Plan is
intended to provide any Participant with any right to consent to or
object to any transaction that might result in a Change in Control
and each provision of this Plan shall be interpreted in a manner
consistent with this intent. Similarly, nothing in this Section 12
or any other provision of this Plan is intended to provide any
Participant with any right to consent to or object to any action
taken by the Board or Committee in connection with a Change in
Control transaction. 

ARTICLE 13 

Other Provisions Applicable to Awards 

13.1             Award
Agreements  .   All Awards shall be
evidenced by an Award Agreement. The Award Agreement shall include
such terms and provisions as the Committee determines appropriate.
The terms of the Award Agreement may vary depending on the type of
Award, the employee or classification of the employee to whom the
Award is made and such other factors as the Committee deems
appropriate. 

13.2             Termination
of Employment or Service  .  Subject to the provisions of this
Plan, the Committee shall determine and set forth in the applicable
Award Agreement the extent to which a Participant shall
(i) have the right to retain and/or exercise an Award
following a Termination of Employment or (Termination of Service in
the context of a Consultant or Non-Employee Director) or (ii) be
entitled to accelerated vesting if the Participant is
terminated following a Change in Control. Such provisions need
not be uniform among all types of Awards and may reflect
distinctions based on the reasons for such terminations, including,
but not limited to, death, Disability, a termination for Cause or
reasons relating to the breach or threatened breach of restrictive
covenants. 

13.3             Form
of Payment  .  Subject
to the provisions of this Plan, the Award Agreement and any
applicable law, payments or transfers to be made by the Company or
any Affiliate on the grant, exercise, or settlement of any Award
may be made in such form as determined by the Committee including,
without limitation, cash, Stock, other Awards, or other property,
or any combination thereof, and may be made in a single payment or
transfer, in installments, or any combination thereof, in each case
determined by rules adopted by the Committee. 

13.4  
        Limits on
Transfer . 

(a)            General  . 
Except as provided in Section 6.1(f), Section 7.1(f), Section
13.4(b) or Section 13.5, no Award granted under the Plan may be
sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or
hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order (that would
otherwise qualify as a qualified domestic relations order as
defined in the Code or Title I of ERISA but for the fact that the
order pertains to an Award) in favor of a spouse or, if applicable,
until the expiration of any period during which any restrictions
are applicable or any Performance Period as determined by the
Committee. 

(b)            Transfer
to Family Members  . 
The Committee shall have the authority to adopt a written policy
that is applicable to existing Awards, new Awards, or both, which
permits a Participant to transfer Awards during his or her lifetime
to any Family Member. In the event an Award is transferred as
permitted by such policy, such transferred Award may not be
subsequently transferred by the transferee (other than another
transfer meeting the conditions set forth in the policy) except by
will or the laws of descent and distribution. A transferred Award
shall continue to be governed by and subject to the terms and
limitations of the Plan and relevant Award Agreement, and the
transferee shall be entitled to the same rights as the Participant,
as if the transfer had not taken place. 

11 

13.5             Beneficiaries  . 
Notwithstanding Section 13.4(a), a Participant may, in the manner
determined by the Committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise
the rights of the Participant and to receive any distribution with
respect to any Award upon the Participant s death, and in
accordance with Section 6.2(c)(iii), upon the Participant s
Disability. A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative, or
other person claiming any rights pursuant to the Plan is subject to
all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award Agreement
applicable to the Participant, except to the extent the Plan and
Award Agreement otherwise provide, and to any additional
restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee. If
no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Participant,
payment shall be made to the person entitled thereto pursuant to
the Participant s will or the laws of descent and
distribution. Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary designation
may be changed or revoked by a Participant at any time provided the
change or revocation is provided to the Committee. 

13.6             Evidence
of Ownership  .   Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue
or deliver any certificates, make any book entry credits, or take
any other action to evidence shares of Stock pursuant to the
exercise of any Award, unless and until the Company has determined,
with advice of counsel, that the issuance and delivery of such
certificates, book entry credits, or other evidence of ownership is
in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental
authorities and, if applicable, the requirements of any exchange or
quotation system on which the shares of Stock are listed, quoted or
traded. All Stock certificates, book entry credits, or other
evidence of ownership delivered pursuant to the Plan are subject to
any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Company
deems necessary or advisable to comply with Federal, state, or
foreign jurisdiction, securities or other laws, rules and
regulations and the rules of any national securities exchange or
automated quotation system on which the Stock is listed, quoted, or
traded. The Company may place legends on any Stock certificate to
reference restrictions applicable to the Stock. In addition to the
terms and conditions provided herein, the Company may require that
a Participant make such reasonable covenants, agreements, and
representations as the Company, in its discretion, deems advisable
in order to comply with any such laws, regulations, or
requirements. 

13.7             Claw
back  .   Every Award issued pursuant
to this Plan is subject to potential forfeiture or recovery to the
fullest extent called for by law, any applicable listing standard,
or any current or future claw back policy that may be adopted by
the Company from time to time, including, without limitation, any
claw back policy adopted to comply with the final rules issued by
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the final listing
standards to be adopted by Nasdaq pursuant to Section 954 of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. By
accepting an Award, each Participant consents to the potential
forfeiture or recovery of his or her Awards pursuant to applicable
law, listing standard, and/or Company claw back policy, and agrees
to be bound by and comply with the claw back policy and to return
the full amount required by the claw back policy. As a condition to
the receipt of any Award, a Participant may be required to execute
any requested additional documents consenting to and agreeing to
abide by the Company claw back policy as it may be amended from
time to time. 

ARTICLE 14 

Amendment, Modification and Termination 

14.1             Amendment,
Modification and Termination of the Plan  .  The Board may at any time, and from
time to time, terminate, amend or modify the Plan; provided
however, that any such action of the Board shall be subject to
approval of the stockholders to the extent required by law,
regulation or any stock exchange rule for any exchange on which
shares of Stock are listed. Notwithstanding the above, to the
extent permitted by law, the Board may delegate to the Committee or
the CEO the authority to approve non-substantive amendments to the
Plan.  Except as provided in Section 5.4, neither the
Board, the CEO, nor the Committee may, without the approval of the
stockholders: (a) increase the number of shares available under the
Plan; (b) reprice previously granted Options or SARs or take
any action relative to Options or SARs that would be treated
as a repricing under applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules (or the rules
of any exchange on which the Stock is then listed); (c) grant

Company nor the Committee is obligated to treat Participants and
other persons uniformly. 

17.2             Continued
Employment  .   Nothing in the Plan or any

of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate any
Participant s employment or service at any time, nor confer
upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ or service
of the Company. 

17.3             Funding  .   The
Company shall not be required to segregate any of its assets to
ensure the payment of any Award under the Plan. Neither the

fund or in any specific asset or assets of the Company or any other
entity by reason of any Award, except to the extent expressly
provided hereunder. The interests of each Participant and former
Participant hereunder are unsecured and shall be subject to the
general creditors of the Company. 

13 

17.4             Expenses  . 
The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the
Company. 

17.5             No

Participant any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company
unless and until shares of Stock are in fact issued to such person
in connection with such Award. 

17.6             Titles
and Headings  .   The titles and headings of
the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and,
in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than
such titles or headings, shall control. 

17.7             Successors
and Assigns  .  The Plan
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors

under the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be governed by and
construed exclusively and solely in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York without regard to the conflict of law s
provisions of any jurisdictions. All parties agree to submit to the
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of New York with
respect to matters relating to the Plan and agree not to raise or
assert the defense that such forum is not convenient for such
party. The Plan is an unfunded performance-based bonus plan for a
select group of persons or highly compensated employees and is not
intended to be either an employee pension or welfare benefit plan
subject to ERISA. 

17.11             Securities

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee may
impose such conditions on the exercise of any Award as may be
required to satisfy the requirements of Rule 16b-3 or its
successors pursuant to the Exchange Act. To the extent any
provision of the Plan or action by the Committee fails to so
comply, it shall be void to the extent permitted by law and
voidable as deemed advisable by the Committee.

Compliance  .  Some of

not necessarily limited to, Restricted Stock Units Awards,
Performance Share Awards, Performance Share Unit Awards,
Performance Cash and Stock Unit Awards) may be considered to be
 non-qualified deferred compensation  subject to
Section 409A of the Code. If an Award is subject to Section 409A of
the Code, the Company intends (but cannot and does not guarantee)
that the Award Agreement and this Plan comply with and meet all of
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or an exception
thereto and the Award Agreement shall include such provisions, in
addition to the provisions of this Plan, as may be necessary to
assure compliance with Section 409A of the Code or an exception
thereto. 

14 

(b)            Delay
for Specified Employees  .  If, at the time of a
Participant s Separation from Service, the Company has any
Stock which is publicly traded on an established securities market
or otherwise, and if the Participant is considered to be a
Specified Employee, to the extent any payment for any Award is
subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and is
payable upon the Participant s Separation from Service, such
payment shall not commence prior to the first business day
following the date which is six (6) months after the
Participant s Separation from Service (or the date of the
Participant s death if earlier than the end of the six (6)
month period). Any amounts that would have been distributed during
such six (6) month period will be distributed on the day following
the expiration of the six (6) month period. 

(c)            Prohibition
on Acceleration or Deferral  .  Under no circumstances may the time or
schedule of any payment for any Award that is subject to the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code be accelerated or subject
to further deferral except as otherwise permitted or required
pursuant to regulations and other guidance issued pursuant to
Section 409A of the Code. If the Company fails to make any payment
pursuant to the payment provisions applicable to an Award that is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, either intentionally or
unintentionally, within the time period specified in such
provisions, but the payment is made within the same calendar year,
such payment will be treated as made within the specified time
period. In addition, in the event of a dispute with respect to any
payment, such payment may be delayed in accordance with the
regulations and other guidance issued pursuant to Section 409A of
the Code.

(mm)             Separation
from Service   is a term that applies only in the
context of an Award that the Company concludes is subject to
Section 409A of the Code. In that limited context, the term
 Separation from Service  means either: (i) the
termination of a Participant s employment with the Company
and all Affiliates due to death, retirement or other reasons; or
(ii) a permanent reduction in the level of bona fide services the
Participant provides to the Company and all Affiliates to an amount

service calculated in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii). Solely for purposes of determining whether a

continuing while the Participant is on military leave, medical or
sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence (if the period of
such leave does not exceed six (6) months, or if longer, so long as
the Participant s right to reemployment with the Company or

statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to
terminate on the first day immediately following the expiration of
such six (6) month period. Whether a Termination of Employment has

circumstances and in accordance with Section 409A of the
Code.
