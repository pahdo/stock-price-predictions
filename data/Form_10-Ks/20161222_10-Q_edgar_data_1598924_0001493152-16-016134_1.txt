To:  
      The
    Board of Directors and Stockholders of

    Chain Group Limited, Inc.   

We
have reviewed the accompanying interim consolidated balance sheets of Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. (the  Company )
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss and the statements
of cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These interim consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company s management.  

We
conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review
of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  

Based
on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim consolidated financial
statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial losses in previous years and has a working capital
deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regards
to these matters are also described in Note 3. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.

ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES   

Business   

Image
Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) ( ICGL  or the  Company )
was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013. From inception through the date of the Share Exchange as defined
below, the Company was an emerging forward-thinking full-service television pre-production company dedicated to the creation of
original concepts and programming with a bold and innovative edge in the reality television space for sale, option and licensure
to independent producers, cable television networks, syndication companies, and other entities. On June 11, 2015, the Company
amended its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada in order to change its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.
and to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 70,000,000 to 400,000,000 (the  Amendments ). The name
change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortune
Delight Holdings Group Ltd ( FDHG ). The increase in authorized shares was undertaken to allow the Company to utilize
the newly available shares to raise capital. The board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved the Amendments
on May 8, 2015.  

FDHG,
through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, is in the business of promoting and distributing its own branded teas that are
grown, harvested, cured, and packaged in the People s Republic of China ( PRC ). The Company s headquarters
is located in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, PRC. Currently, the Company s products are sold in the PRC for domestic consumption.  

Share
Exchange   

On
May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with FDHG and Wu Jun Rui, on
behalf of himself and certain other individuals who were to receive shares of ICGL pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (the  Shareholders ).
On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000
shares of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG, to ICGL in exchange for the issuance
to the shareholders of 59,620,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $.001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of
the Company s preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. The preferred stock is not convertible nor mandatorily redeemable;
it does not pay dividends or carrying any voting rights but is entitled to liquidation preference.  

As
a result of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company s wholly owned subsidiary. FDHG is an investment
holding company incorporated and domiciled in the British Virgin Islands. FDHG wholly owns Silver Channel Industrial Limited,
a limited company incorporated, registered, and domiciled in Hong Kong.  

The
securities purchase agreement transaction is referred to hereafter as the  reverse-merger transaction.  The share
exchange transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of ICGL where ICGL (the legal acquirer) is considered the accounting
acquiree and FDHG (the legal acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. As a result of this transaction, ICGL is deemed
to be a continuation of the business of FDHG.  

Accordingly,
the accompanying consolidated financial statements are those of the accounting acquirer, FDHG. The historical stockholders 
equity of the accounting acquirer prior to the share exchange has been retroactively restated as if the share exchange transaction
occurred as of the beginning of the first period presented.

owned by Heyuan Image. Guangzhou Image has a registered capital of RMB 10 million of which is still outstanding.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

(a)
Method of Accounting   

The
Company maintains its general ledger and journals with the accrual method of accounting for financial reporting purposes. The
financial statements and notes are representations of management. Accounting policies adopted by the Company conform to generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) and have been consistently applied in the
presentation of financial statements.  

(b)
Basis of Presentation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP.  

(c)
Principles of Consolidation   

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements include 100%
of assets, liabilities, and net income or loss of those wholly-owned subsidiaries.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the detailed identities of the consolidating subsidiaries are as follows:  

(d)
Economic and Political Risks   

The
Company s operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with
companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic, legal
environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and
social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary
measures, currency conversion, restriction on international remittances, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.  

(e)
Use of Estimates   

In
preparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements,
as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting years. These accounts and estimates include, but
are not limited to, the estimation on useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CHAIN GROUP LIMITED, INC.   

   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

(f)
Cash and Cash Equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash in time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments
with original maturities of three months or less. As of September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were mainly denominated
in HKD and were placed with banks in Hong Kong. Cash and cash equivalents denominated in RMB may not be freely convertible into
foreign currencies and the remittance of these funds out of the PRC may be subjected to exchange control restrictions imposed
by the PRC government.  

(g)
Accounts Receivable   

The
Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts
receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and
changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these allowances. Terms of sales vary. Allowances are recorded
primarily on a specific identification basis.  

As
of September 30, 2016, no provision for allowance for doubtful accounts was provided.  

(h)
Other Receivables   

Other
receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An allowance
for doubtful accounts is made when recovery of the full amount is doubtful.  

(i)
Inventories   

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method and includes all costs
of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Market value is determined
by reference to the sales proceeds of items sold in the ordinary course of business or estimates based on prevailing market conditions.  

(j)
Property, Plant and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals
and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property
and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives of:  

Building  
      20
    years   

Computer  
      3
    years   

Motor
    vehicles  
      4
    years   

(k)
Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   

The
Company adopts Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 360,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Live Assets , which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360 which
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and
the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets  carrying amounts. In that
event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets.  

The
long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as
a result of technology or other industry changes. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the
carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets.  

IMAGE
CHAIN GROUP LIMITED, INC.   

   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell. During the reporting periods, there was no impairment loss.  

(l)
Customer Advances   

Customer
advance was received from customers in connection with orders of products to be delivered in future periods.  

(m)
Revenue Recognition   

The
Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) 104, included
in the Codification as ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition . Sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when
a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, no other significant obligations of
the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue
recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.  

The
Company does not allow its customers to return products. The Company s customers can exchange products only if they are
damaged in transportation.  

Revenue
reported is net of value added tax.  

(n)
Cost of Sales   

The
Company s cost of sales is comprised of the inbound acquisition cost of packaged finished goods for resale, inbound shipping,
value added tax and business taxes recognized upon sales of goods.  

(o)
Selling Expenses   

Selling
expenses are comprised of salaries for the sales force, client entertainment, commissions, advertising, and travel and lodging
expenses.  

(p)
General   Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses include executive compensation, general overhead such as the finance department and administrative
staff, depreciation, office rental and utilities.  

(q)
Foreign Currency Translation   

The
Company maintains its financial statements in the functional currencies on Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and Hong Kong Dollars ( HKD ).
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional
currency at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchanges rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Exchange
gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income for the respective
periods.  

For
financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Company, which are prepared using the functional currency, have
been translated into United States dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet dates
and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and stockholders  equity is translated at historical
exchange rates. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net loss but are included in foreign exchange adjustment
to other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders  equity.  

IMAGE
CHAIN GROUP LIMITED, INC.   

   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

RMB
is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions.
No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at the rates used in translation.
The HKD is freely convertible into other foreign currencies.  

(r)
Income Taxes   

The
Company adopts SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, included in the Codification as ASC 740,  Income Taxes,  which
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences
in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period
end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to
be realized.  

On
January 1, 2007, The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
( FIN 48 ), included in the Codification as ASC 740,  Income Taxes.  The topic addresses the determination of
whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC
740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits
recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater
than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.  

(s)
Statutory Reserve   

Statutory
reserve refers to the amount appropriated from the net income in accordance with PRC laws or regulations, which can be used to
recover losses and increase capital, as approved, and, are to be used to expand production or operations. PRC laws prescribe that
an enterprise operating at a profit, must appropriate, on an annual basis, from its earnings, an amount to the statutory reserve
to be used for future company development. Such an appropriation is made until the reserve reaches a maximum equal to 50% of the
enterprise s registered capital.  

(t)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

For
certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts
and other payables, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short
maturities. ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial
instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments,  defines fair value, and establishes a three-level
valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments
and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments
and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined
as follows:

CHAIN GROUP LIMITED, INC.   

   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

Level
    1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level
    2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
    that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
    instrument.   

Level
    3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.   

The
Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity,  and ASC 815.  

The
Company s financial instruments include cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Cash and cash equivalents
consist of deposits financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less. Management estimates the carrying
amounts of the non-related party financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.  

The
following is table of the Company s financial instruments:  

As
of September 30, 2016:   

As
of December 31, 2015 :  

(u)
Other Comprehensive Income   

The
Company s functional currency is the Renminbi ( RMB ). For financial reporting purposes, RMB were translated
into United States Dollars ( USD  or  $ ) as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated
at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange
prevailing during the reporting period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to
period are included as a component of stockholders  equity as  Accumulated other comprehensive income . Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income.  

The
Company uses FASB ASC Topic 220,  Reporting Comprehensive Income . Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and
all changes to the statements of stockholders  equity, except for changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders
due to investments by stockholders.  

(v)
Business combination   

Business
combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805,  Business Combinations.
 Under the acquisition method the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes 100 percent of the acquired assets
and assumed liabilities, regardless of the percentage owned, at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as
goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including other identifiable assets, exceed the purchase price,
a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed from contingencies must also be recognized at fair
value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. Results of operations of an acquired business are included
in the statement of earnings from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs, including conversion and restructuring charges,
are expensed as incurred.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

On
January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement
of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity s accounting
related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair
value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated
with the fair value of financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  

On
February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02  Leases (Topic 842) , its new standard on accounting for leases. ASU
2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet. The new standard also aligns many of the underlying
principles of the new lessor model with those in ASC 606, the FASB s new revenue recognition standard (e.g., those related
to evaluating when profit can be recognized).  

Furthermore,
the ASU addresses other concerns related to the current leases model. For example, the ASU eliminates the requirement in current
U.S. GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. The standard also requires lessors to increase
the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure. The new model
represents a wholesale change to lease accounting. As a result, entities will face significant implementation challenges during
the transition period and beyond, such as those related to:  

Applying
    judgment and estimating.   

Managing
    the complexities of data collection, storage, and maintenance.    

Enhancing
    information technology systems to ensure their ability to perform the calculations necessary for compliance with reporting
    requirements.    

Refining
    internal controls and other business processes related to leases.    

Determining
    whether debt covenants are likely to be affected and, if so, working with lenders to avoid violations.    

Addressing
    any income tax implications.    

The
new guidance will be effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (e.g., calendar
periods beginning on January 1, 2019), and interim periods therein.  

On
March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07  Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying
the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting , which simplifies the equity method of accounting by eliminating the
requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result
of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. Consequently, when an investment qualifies for the equity
method (as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence), the cost of acquiring the additional
interest in the investee would be added to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and the equity method
would be applied subsequently from the date on which the investor obtains the ability to exercise significant influence over the
investee. The ASU further requires that unrealized holding gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income related to
an available-for-sale security that becomes eligible for the equity method be recognized in earnings as of the date on which the
investment qualifies for the equity method.  

The
guidance in the ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within those fiscal years; early adoption is permitted for all entities. Entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively
to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence occurring after the ASU s effective date. Additional
transition disclosures are not required upon adoption.

On
March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations
in the Board s new revenue standard (ASU 2014-09). The FASB issued the ASU in response to concerns identified by stakeholders,
including those related to (1) determining the appropriate unit of account under the revenue standard s principal-versus-agent
guidance and (2) applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in accordance with the revenue standard s
control principle. Among other things, the ASU clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent
for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. As defined in the ASU, a specified good or service
is  a distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle of goods or services) to be provided to the customer.  Therefore,
for contracts involving more than one specified good or service, the entity may be the principal for one or more specified goods
or services and the agent for others.  

The
ASU has the same effective date as the new revenue standard (as amended by the one-year deferral and the early adoption provisions
in ASU 2015-14). In addition, entities are required to adopt the ASU by using the same transition method they used to adopt the
new revenue standard.  

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions
for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding
requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  

The
ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual
reporting periods.  

As
of September 30, 2016, there are no other recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would or could have a material
effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

(x)
Contingencies   

Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company
but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company s management assesses
such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies
related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the
Company s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived
merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.  

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s consolidated financial statements. If the
assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but
cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable
and material would be disclosed.  

Loss
contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case
the guarantee would be disclosed.  

3.
GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES   

These
financial statements have been prepared assuming that Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had accumulated deficits of $7,158,518 due to the substantial losses in operation in the current
year. Management s plan to support the Company in operations and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through
public and private offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation. If
we do not raise all of the money we need from public or private offerings, we will have to find alternative sources, such as loans
or advances from our officers, directors or others. Such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and
there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the
long term. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in
the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. If we require
additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations or cease business entirely.

   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or
the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

4.
GOODWILL   

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable assets acquired in a business
combination. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , goodwill is no longer
subject to amortization. Rather, goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment, applying a fair-value based
test. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.  

On
February 16, 2015, the Company, through Guangzhou Image, entered into an equity transfer agreement to acquire 100% of Yunnan Image.
As of December 31, 2014, the net assets of Yunnan Image were $166,022. The purchase consideration was $489,515 (equivalent to
RMB 3,000,000), which resulted in goodwill of USD 323,493.  

The
Company reviews the carrying value of the goodwill for impairment regularly. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company
reviewed the carrying value of its goodwill and provided an impairment for such goodwill since the acquisition of Yunnan Image
has not generated positive cash flow.

Overview   

Image
Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) ( ICGL  or the  Company )
was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013. From inception through the date of the Exchange Agreement as defined
below, the Company was an emerging forward-thinking full-service television pre-production company dedicated to the creation of
original concepts and programming with a bold and innovative edge in the reality television space for sale, option and licensure
to independent producers, cable television networks, syndication companies, and other entities.  

On
May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with Fortune Delight Holdings
Group Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation ( FDHG ) and Wu Jun Rui, on behalf of himself and certain other individuals
who are to receive shares of ICGL ( Shareholders ) pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. On the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000 shares of FDHG common stock,
consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG to ICGL. In exchange for the transfer of such securities by Wu
Jun Rui, ICGL issued, to the Shareholders, 59,620,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $.001 per share and
5,000,000 shares of the Company s preferred stock, par value $.001 per share.  

As
a result of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company s wholly owned subsidiary. FDHG is the parent
company of Silver Channel Industrial Ltd., a Hong Kong company, which, in turn, holds 100% equity interest of Heyuan Image Machinery
Import and Export Co., Ltd., a PRC corporation ( Heyuan Image ). Heyuan Image, through Guangzhou Image Agricultural
Technology Ltd., a PRC corporation, owns 100% of Yunnan Image Tea Industrial Ltd. ( YITIL ). ICGL, through its wholly-owned
operating subsidiaries, is in the business of promoting and distributing its owned branded teas that are grown, harvested, cured,
and packaged in the People s Republic of China ( PRC ).  

The
Company s headquarters is located in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, PRC. Currently, the Company s products are sold
in the PRC for domestic consumption.  

On
June 11, 2015, the Company changed its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. in order to more closely align it with the company s
current business.  

Results
of Operations   

The
following provides selected financial data about our company for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015.  

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

The
Company recognized $21,146 in sales revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $37,490 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of approximately 44%. The change in the amount of sales revenue is a
result of recovery from the Chinese economy downturn.  

For
the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized cost of sales of 10,325 as compared to $44,173 for the same period
in 2015, representing an approximate decrease of 77%. The principal reason for the decrease is due to the decrease in sales.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded operating expenses totaling $67,126, a decrease of approximately
95% compared to operating expenses of $1,404,295 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in operating expenses
is primarily due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses.  

As
a result of the factors discussed above, the Company s net loss was $56,307 for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to net loss of $1,411,008 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reason for the change is the
decrease of operating expenses.  

Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

The
Company recognized $319,647 in sales revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $260,383 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of approximately 23%. The change in the amount of sales revenue is a
result of prospering overall Chinese economy.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized cost of sales of $159,800 as compared to $131,900 for the same
period in 2015, representing a 21% increase. The principal reason for this increase is the increase in sales.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded operating expenses totaling $599,969, a decrease of approximately
91% comparing to operating expenses of $6,487,409 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decline in operating expenses
was primarily caused by the decrease in general and administrative expenses.  

As
a result of the factors discussed above, the Company s net loss was $439,905 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to a net loss of $6,349,819 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The reason for the change was primarily
due to the decrease of operating expenses.

We
had cash and cash equivalents of $54,865 as of September 31, 2016 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $78,753 as of December
31, 2015. We had a working capital of $1,036,075 as of September 31, 2016 compared to a working capital of $1,098,971 as of December
31, 2015.  

The
report of our auditors on our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, contains
a going concern qualification as we have suffered substantial losses in operations. We will remain dependent on financings and
loans or advances from our officers, directors or others to continue our operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to stockholders.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including
the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies
to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the
following:  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables and
accrued expenses, Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial
instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
cannot be determined with precision. We consider the carrying values of our financial instruments in the consolidated financial
statements to approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for using straight-line methods over
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, usually three to seven years.  

Accounting
for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   

The
Company adopts Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 360,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Live Assets , which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360 which
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and
the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets  carrying amounts. In that
event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets.  

The
long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as
a result of technology or other industry changes. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the
carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets.  

If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell. During the reporting periods, there was no impairment loss.

4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

The
Company is currently developing a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective
of ensuring that this information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s
chief executive officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation with the participation of the Company s
management, including the Company s chief executive officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Based upon that
evaluation, the Company s chief executive officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective; however, the Company is taking steps to remediate the deficiency. As noted above the Company is currently developing
a set of disclosure controls and procedures and considering engaging outside service providers to provide expertise on this matter.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

We
will begin to regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems
to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes
may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, migrating processes, and consulting
with outside experts.  

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Inherent
Limitations over Internal Controls   

ICGL s
management does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or
fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within ICGL have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies
or procedures.
