Note 1 - Company Organization and Description  

In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited condensed financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments which are necessary
for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. The unaudited condensed
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all the information
and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and notes included in the Company s April 30, 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the
six months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. 

Biosynergy, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Illinois on February 9, 1976. It is primarily engaged in the development and marketing of medical,
consumer and industrial thermometric and thermographic products that utilize cholesteric liquid crystals. The Company s primary
product, the HemoTemp II Blood Monitoring Device, accounted for approximately 91.8% of the sales during the quarter ending October
31, 2016 and 88.7% during the six month period ending October 31, 2016. The products are sold to hospitals, clinical end-users,
laboratories and product dealers located throughout the United States. 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Cash   

The Company maintains all of its cash in various
bank deposit accounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. No losses have been experienced on such accounts. 

Receivables  

Receivables are carried at original invoice
less estimates made for doubtful receivables. Management determines the allowances for doubtful accounts by reviewing and identifying
troubled accounts on a periodic basis and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts. A receivable is considered
to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than 30 days or 90 days for a dealer. Receivables
are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received. 

Inventories  

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
FIFO (first-in, first-out) method. 

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)  

Depreciation and Amortization  

Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated
at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Repairs
and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred; renewals and betterments which significantly extend the useful lives of existing
equipment are capitalized. Significant leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the term of the lease; equipment
is depreciated over three to ten years. Depreciation expense was $4,004 and $4,201 for the six month period ending October 31,
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Prepaid Expenses  

Certain expenses, primarily insurance and income
taxes, have been prepaid and will be used within one year. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes net sales revenue upon
the shipment of product to customers. 

Research and Development and Patents  

Research and development expenditures are charged
to operations as incurred. The costs of obtaining patents, primarily legal fees, are capitalized and once obtained, amortized over
the life of the respective patent on the straight-line method. 

Patent amortization expense for the six months
ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $4,342 and $4,342, respectively. Patents relate to products that have been developed by the
Company. Patents pending relate to products under development. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. 

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)  

Income Per Common Share  

Income per common share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. When dilutive, stock options are included
as share equivalents using the treasury stock method in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. The Company has no outstanding
options or other rights to acquire its unissued common shares. 

Comprehensive Income  

Components of comprehensive income include
amounts that are included in the comprehensive income but are excluded from net income. During the quarter endings and six month
periods ending October 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no differences between the Company s net income and comprehensive income. 

Income Taxes  

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects
of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due and deferred taxes related primarily to
differences in the methods of accounting for patents, inventories, certain accrued expenses and bad debt expenses for financial
and income tax reporting purposes. The deferred income taxes represent the future tax consequences of those differences, which
will be taxable in the future. 

The Company files tax returns in the U.S. federal
jurisdiction and with the state of Illinois. Various tax years remain open to examinations, generally for three years after filed,
although there are currently no ongoing tax examinations. Management s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related
to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (Continued)  

The provision for income taxes consists of the following components
for the six months ended October 31: 

The differences between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and
the Company s effective tax rate are as follows: 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

The FASB issues ASUs to amend the authoritative
literature in Accounting Standards Certification (ASC). There have been a number of ASUs to date that amend the original text of
ASCs. Those ASUs issued to date either (i) provide supplemental guidance, (ii) are technical corrections, (iii) are not applicable
to the Company or (iv) are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company. 

On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued Topic 842, its highly-anticipated
leasing standard for both lessees and lessors. Under its core principle, a lessee will recognize lease assets and liabilities on
the balance sheet for all arrangements with terms longer than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing
U.S. GAAP. The amendments are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. At inception, a lessee must classify all leases as either finance or operating. The Company
intends to adopt Topic 842 upon extension of the current lease for its facilities in Elk Grove Village or upon entering into a
new lease agreement for alternative facilities on or about May 1, 2018. The Company is investigating the effect of adoption of
Topic 842 on its results of operations and financial condition. However, it is not anticipated that adoption of Topic 842 will
have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. 

In May 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2015-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2015-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2015-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services.
ASU 2015-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required
within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. 

The standard is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective
approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients,
or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2015-09 recognized at the date of adoption
(which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2015-09
on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard as of May 1,
2018. 

Note 3   Inventories  

Components of inventories are as follows: 

Note 4   Common Stock  

The Company s common stock is traded in the over-the-counter
market. However, there is no established public trading market due to limited and sporadic trades. The Company s common stock
is not listed on a recognized market or stock exchange. 

Note 5 - Related Party Transactions  

The Company and its affiliates are related through common stock
ownership as follows as of October 31, 2016: 

Note 5 - Related Party Transactions (continued)  

As of October 31, 2016, $19,699 was due from
F. K. Suzuki International, Inc. These balances result from an allocation of common expenses charged to FKSI prior to April 30,
2006 offset by advances received from time to time. No interest income is received or accrued by the Company. The financial condition
of FKSI is such that it will unlikely be able to repay the Company during the next year without liquidating a portion of its assets,
including a portion of its ownership in the Company. As a result, the receivable balance has been reclassified as a contra equity
account since April 30, 2006. 

A board member provided a variety of legal
services to the Company in his capacity as a partner in a law firm. Fees for such legal services were approximately $13,765 and
$11,730 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Note 6   Lease Commitments  

In January 2015, the Company entered into a
three-year lease agreement for its current facilities, which expires on April 30, 2018. The base rent under the lease escalates
over the life of the lease. However, rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis as required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. As of October 31, 2016, the Company s approximate total future minimum lease payments
are as follows: 

Also included in the lease agreement are escalation
clauses for the lessor s increases in property taxes and other operating expenses. 

Note 7   Customer Concentrations  

Shipments to one customer amounted to 28.36%
of sales during the first six months of Fiscal 2017 compared to 29.39% during the comparative Fiscal 2016 period. As of October
31, 2016, there were outstanding accounts receivable from this customer of $68,616 compared to $60,651 at October 31, 2015. Shipments
to another customer amounted to 34.85% of sales during the first six months of Fiscal 2017 and 36.68% of sales during the first
six months of Fiscal 2016. As of October 31, 2016, there were outstanding accounts receivable from this customer of $71,141 compared
to $51,935 at October 31, 2015. 

The Company had export sales of $30,090 during
the first six months of Fiscal 2017, and export sales of $9,630 during the Quarter ending October 31, 2016. The Company also believes
that some of its medical devices were sold to distributors within the United States who resold the devices in foreign markets.
However, the Company does not have any information regarding such sales and such sales are not considered to be material. 

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Net Sales/Revenues  

For the three month period ending October 31,
2016 ( 2nd Quarter ), the net sales increased 3.14%, or $10,647, and decreased .84%, or $5,450, during the six month
period ending October 31, 2016, as compared to net sales for the comparative periods ending in 2015. This decrease in sales is
primarily the result of a decrease in the sales of HemoTemp II and HemoTemp II Activators. As of October 31, 2016, the Company
had $1,090 in back orders. 

In addition to the above, the Company had $587
and $1,174 of other miscellaneous revenues primarily from interest income and leasing a portion of its storage space to a third
party during the three and the six month periods ending October 31, 2016, respectively. 

Costs and Expenses  

   General  

The operating expenses of the Company during
the 2nd Quarter decreased overall by 6.87%, or $12,552, and increased by 1.06%, or $4,076, for the six month period ending October
31, 2016, as compared to the same periods ending in 2015. The decrease during the 2 nd  Quarter was primarily due to timing
of billing for accounting fees and refund of insurance premiums, and the increase for the six month period ending October 31, 2016
was due to engineering and prototype expenses. 

Cost of Sales  

The overall cost of sales during the 2nd Quarter
decreased by $9,783 and decreased by $21,604 during the six month period ending October 31, 2016 as compared to the same periods
ending in 2015 as a result of a decrease in medical device taxes and UL fees. As a percentage of sales, the cost of sales were
27.39% during the 2nd Quarter and 31.12% for the comparative quarter ending in 2015; and 29.22% during the six month period ending
October 31, 2016 compared to 32.33% in 2015. Included in the cost of sales is the medical device excise tax during the 2 nd 
quarter and six month period ending October 31, 2015. There is no medical device tax for Fiscal 2016. It is not anticipated that
the cost of sales as a percentage of sales will materially change in the near future. 

Research and Development Expenses  

Research and Development costs increased $244,
or .65%, during the 2nd Quarter as compared to the same quarter in 2015. These costs increased by $6,462, or 8.8%, during the six
month period ending October 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to the cost of engineering
fees for the HemoTemp II Activators and small increases in employees  salaries and health insurance premiums. 

Marketing Expenses  

Marketing expenses for the 2nd Quarter decreased
by $470, or 1.01%, as compared to the quarter ending October 31, 2015 and decreased by $561, or .60%, during the six month period
ending October 31, 2016 compared to the six-month period ending October 31, 2015. The change in marketing expenses for the six-month
period ending October 31, 2016 compared to the six-month period ending October 31, 2015 was not material or related to any one
material expense item. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

General and administrative costs decreased
by $12,326, or 12.48%, in the 2nd Quarter, and decreased by $1,825, or .85%, during the six month period ending October 31, 2016,
as compared to the same periods in 2015. This overall decrease for the six months ending October 31, 2016 was due primarily to
a refund of insurance premiums paid in prior quarters. Except for unforeseen items and ordinary cost increases, it is unlikely
general and administrative expenses will materially change during the remainder of Fiscal 2017. 

Net Income  

The Company realized a net income of $58,499
during the 2nd Quarter as compared to a net income of $35,462 for the comparative quarter in the prior year. The Company also realized
a net income of $46,457 for the six month period ending October 31, 2016 as compared to a net income of $37,724 during the same
period in 2015. The increase in net income is a result of a decrease in cost of goods sold, primarily the medical device tax. 

Assets/Liabilities  

  General  

Since April 30, 2016, the Company's assets
have increased by $42,124 and liabilities have decreased by $4,333. The increase in assets, primarily cash, inventory and patents,
is due to the overall profitability of the Company since April 30, 2016. 

Related Party Transactions  

The Company was owed $19,699 by F.K. Suzuki
International, Inc. ( FKSI ), an affiliate, at October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2015. This account primarily represents
common expenses which were previously charged by the Company to FKSI for reimbursement. No interest is received or accrued by the
Company. Collectability of the amounts due from FKSI cannot be assured without the liquidation of all or a portion of its assets,
including a portion of its common stock of the Company. As a result, the amount owed by FKSI to the Company is classified as a
reduction of FKSI s capital in the Company. 

A board member provides a variety of legal
services to the Company in his capacity as a partner in a law firm. Fees for such legal services were approximately $13,765 and
$11,730 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Current Assets/Liabilities Ratio  

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities,
22.47 to 1, has increased compared to 20.51 to 1 at April 30, 2016. In order to maintain or improve the Company s asset/liabilities
ratio, the Company s operations must remain profitable. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

During the six month period ending October
31, 2016, the Company experienced an increase in working capital of $42,859. This is primarily due to the Company s net income
sustained during the six month period ending October 31, 2016. 

The Company has attempted to conserve working
capital whenever possible. To this end, the Company attempts to keep inventory at minimum levels. The Company believes that it
will be able to maintain adequate inventory to supply its customers on a timely basis by careful planning and forecasting demand
for its products. However, the Company is nevertheless required to carry a minimum amount of inventory to meet the delivery requirements
of customers and thus, inventory represents a substantial portion of the Company s investment in current assets. 

The Company presently grants payment terms
to most customers and dealers of 30 days. The Company has granted a dealer terms of 90 days. Although the Company experiences varying
collection periods of its account receivable, the Company believes that uncollectable accounts receivable will not have a significant
effect on future liquidity. 

The cash provided by operating activities was
$13,051 during the six month period ending October 31, 2016. $11,944 was used for patent expenses and equipment purchases during
this same period. Except for its operating working capital, limited equipment purchases and patent expenses, management is not
aware of any other material capital requirements or material contingencies for which it must provide. There were no cash flows
from financing activities during the six month period ending October 31, 2016. 

As of October 31, 2016, the Company had $1,457,144
of current assets available. Of this amount, $17,431 was prepaid expenses, $160,058 was inventory, $186,899 was net trade receivables
and $1,092,756 was cash. The Company s available cash and cash flow are considered adequate to fund the short-term capital
needs of the Company. The Company does not have a working line of credit, and does not anticipate obtaining a working line of credit
in the near future. Thus there is a risk additional financing may be necessary to fund long-term capital needs of the Company,
although there is no such currently known long-term capital needs other than operations. 

Effects of Inflation . With the exception
of raw material and labor costs increasing with inflation, inflation has not had a material effect on the Company s revenues
and income from continuing operations in the past three years. Inflation is not expected to have a material effect in the foreseeable
future. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates .
On December 12, 2001, the SEC issued FR-60  Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies. 
FR-60 is an intermediate step to alert companies to the need for greater investor awareness of the sensitivity of financial statements
to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying their preparation, including the judgments and uncertainties affecting the
application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions
or using different assumptions. 

The Company s significant accounting
policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the Financial Statements for the 2nd Quarter. See  Financial Statements.  Except
as noted below, the impact on the Company s financial position or results of operation would not have been materially different
had the Company reported under different conditions or used different assumptions. The policies which may have materially affected
the financial position and results of operations of the Company if such information had been reported under different circumstances
or assumptions are: none. 

Use of Estimates.  Preparation of financial
statements and conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
The financial condition of the Company and results of operations may differ from the estimates and assumptions made by management
in preparation of the Financial Statements accompanying this report. 

Allowance for Bad Debts . The Company
periodically performs credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral to support amounts due from
the sale of its products. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its best estimate of accounts receivable. 

Forward-Looking Statements  

This report may contain statements which, to
the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the  Reform Act ). Such forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements for reasons including, but not limited
to, changes to and developments in the legislative and regulatory environments effecting the Company s business, the impact
of competitive products and services, changes in the medical and laboratory industries caused by various factors, risks inherit
in marketing new products, as well as other factors as set forth in this report. Thus, such forward-looking statements should not
be relied upon to indicate the actual results which might be obtained by the Company. No representation or warranty of any kind
is given with respect to the accuracy of such forward-looking information. The forward-looking information has been prepared by
the management of the Company and has not been reviewed or compiled by independent public accountants. 

Item 3.  Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . 

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company s
primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with its short term money market investments. The Company does
not have any financial instruments held for trading or other speculative purposes and does not invest in derivative financial instruments,
