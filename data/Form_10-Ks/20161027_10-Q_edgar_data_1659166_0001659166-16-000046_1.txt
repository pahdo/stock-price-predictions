  BACKGROUND: 
  A.    Owner or its subsidiary owns or leases and operates     certain civil aircraft identified on Exhibit A to this Agreement (the  Aircraft ). 
  B.    Owner or its subsidiary employs fully qualified flight crews to operate the Aircraft; and 
  C.    From time to time, Lessee may desire to lease the Aircraft with a flight crew from Owner for Lessee s personal travel at Lessee s discretion on a non-exclusive time sharing basis as defined in Section 91.501(c)(1) of the Federal Aviation Regulations ( FAR ). 
  NOW, THEREFORE,   Owner and Lessee agree as follows: 
  1.          This Agreement shall govern personal use of the Aircraft by Lessee or by family members or guests of Lessee as and to the extent set forth in such policy or policies as the Board of Directors of Owner, or the Compensation Committee thereof, shall adopt from time to time.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Owner agrees to lease, from time to time on a non-exclusive and non-continuous basis, the Aircraft to Lessee for Lessee s personal travel at Lessee s discretion pursuant to the provisions of FAR Sections 91.501(b)(6), 91.501(c)(1) and 91.501(d) and to provide a fully qualified flight crew for all operations for flights scheduled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and terminating on the earlier of (a) the termination of this Agreement by consent of Owner and Lessee, (b) the date of Lessee s termination of employment with Owner and (c) the date of Lessee s death. Owner shall have the right to add or substitute aircraft of similar type, quality, and equipment, and to remove aircraft from the fleet, from time to time during the term of this Agreement. Owner shall send Lessee a revised Exhibit A upon each such change in the Aircraft. 
  2.          For each flight conducted under this Agreement and subject to the Owner s Policy on Use of Company Aircraft that may be in effect from time to time, Lessee shall pay Owner the actual, incremental cost to the Owner of such flight but only to the extent authorized by FAR Section 91.501(d) as in effect from time to time. As of the effective date of this Agreement, such payment from Lessee to Owner for any specific flight shall not exceed:

  (b)    travel expenses of the crew, including food, lodging and ground transportation; 
  (c)    hangar and tie down costs away from the Aircraft s base of operation;

     3.          Subject to the Owner s Policy on Use of Company Aircraft that may be in effect from time to time, Owner will pay all expenses related to the operation of each Aircraft when incurred and will provide quarterly invoices to Lessee for the expenses enumerated in Section 2 above. The Owner and Lessee acknowledge that, with the exception of the expenses for in-flight food and beverages and passenger ground transportation, the payment of these expenses are subject to the federal excise tax imposed under Section 4261 of the Internal Revenue Code. Lessee shall reimburse Owner for the expenses authorized by FAR Section 91.501(d) plus applicable federal excise taxes within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the related invoice. Owner agrees to collect and remit to the Internal Revenue Service for the benefit of Lessee all such federal excise taxes. 
  4.          In the event that Lessee desires to use the Aircraft pursuant to this Agreement, Lessee will so notify Owner and will provide Owner with requests for flight time and proposed flight schedules as far as possible in advance of any given flight. Requests for flight time shall be in a form, whether oral or written, mutually convenient to and agreed upon by Owner and Lessee. In addition to proposed schedules and flight times, Lessee shall provide at least the following information for each proposed flight at some time prior to scheduled departure as required by Owner or Owner's flight crew:

  (b)    destinations; 
  (c)    date and time of flight; 
  (d)    the identity of each anticipated passenger;

Lessee s use of the Aircraft shall be on a non-exclusive and non-continuous basis and as needed and as available.

Owner retains the right, during the Term, (a) to use and operate the Aircraft under FAR Part 91 and (b) to the extent permitted by the FARs, to lease and/or furnish (under separate time sharing or interchange agreements) the Aircraft to one or more third parties who may also use and/or operate the Aircraft under FAR Part 91. 
  6.          Owner shall be solely responsible for securing maintenance, preventive maintenance, and required or otherwise necessary inspections on the Aircraft and shall take such requirements into account in scheduling flights of the various Aircraft.

The pilot-in-command shall have final and complete authority to cancel any flight for any reason or condition that in his or her judgment would compromise the safety of the flight. 
  7.

Lessee specifically agrees that the flight crew shall have final and complete authority to delay or cancel any flight for any reason or condition which, in the sole judgment of the pilot-in-command, could compromise the safety of the flight and to take any other action which, in the sole judgment of the pilot in command, is necessitated by considerations of safety.

The liability insurance policies on which Lessee is named an additional insured shall provide that as to Lessee coverage shall not be invalidated or adversely affected by any action or inaction, omission or misrepresentation by Owner or any other person (other than Lessee). Any insurance policies maintained by Owner on any Aircraft used by Lessee under this Agreement shall include a waiver of any rights of subrogation of the insurers against Lessee and shall be primary without any right of contribution from any other insurance available to any other insureds or additional insureds.

    during the term of this Agreement, he will abide by and conform to all such laws, governmental, and airport orders, rules, and regulations as shall from time to time be in effect relating in any way to the operation and use of the Aircraft by a time-sharing lessee.
