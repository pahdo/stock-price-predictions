  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. Company Description 
    
  Erin Energy Corporation (NYSE MKT: ERN; JSE: ERN) is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition and development of energy resources in Africa. The Company s asset portfolio consists of   nine   licenses across   four   countries covering an area of approximately   10 million   acres (approximately   40,000   square kilometers). The Company owns producing properties and conducts exploration activities offshore Nigeria, conducts exploration activities offshore Ghana and The Gambia, and both onshore and offshore Kenya.  
  The Company is headquartered in Houston, Texas and has offices in Lagos, Nigeria, Nairobi, Kenya, Banjul, The Gambia, Accra, Ghana and Johannesburg, South Africa. 
  The Company s operating subsidiaries include Erin Petroleum Nigeria Limited ( EPNL ), Erin Energy Kenya Limited, Erin Energy Gambia Ltd., and Erin Energy Ghana Limited. The terms  we,   us,   our,   the Company,  and  our Company  refer to Erin Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
  The Company also conducts certain business transactions with its majority shareholder, CAMAC Energy Holdings Limited ( CEHL ), and its affiliates, which include Allied Energy Plc. ( Allied ). See   Note 9 - Related Party Transactions   for further information.  
  In May 2016, Dr. Kase L. Lawal retired from service as a member and Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. John Hofmeister, a then current member of our Board of Directors, succeeded Dr. Lawal as the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Segun Omidele, the Company's then Chief Operating Officer, succeeded Dr. Lawal as the Chief Executive Officer. 

2. Basis of Presentation and Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position and results of operations for the indicated periods. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based on certain assumptions. Estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses attributable to the reporting periods. Accordingly, accounting estimates in conformity with U.S. GAAP require the exercise of judgment. These estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and while management believes that the estimates and assumptions are appropriate, actual results could differ from management's estimates. 
    
  Estimates that may have a significant effect on the Company s financial position and results from operations include share-based compensation assumptions, oil and natural gas reserve quantities, impairments, depletion and amortization relating to oil and natural gas properties, asset retirement obligation assumptions, and income taxes. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, additional information is obtained and our operating environment changes. 
    
  Capitalized Interest 
    
  The Company capitalizes interest costs for qualifying oil and gas properties. The capitalization period begins when expenditures are incurred on qualified properties, activities begin which are necessary to prepare the property for production, and interest costs have been incurred. The capitalization period continues as long as these events occur. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of

ERIN ENERGY CORPORATION  
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

the underlying assets and is depleted using the unit-of-production method in the same manner as the underlying assets. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company capitalized   nil   and   $2.2 million  , respectively, in interest cost as additions to property, plant and equipment related to the Oyo field redevelopment campaign. 
    
  Treasury Stock 
    
  Treasury stock is reported at cost and is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Pursuant to the Company s withholding tax policy with respect to vested restricted stock awards, the Company may withhold, on a cashless basis, a number of shares needed to settle statutory withholding tax requirements. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   90,347   shares were withheld for taxes at a total cost of   $0.2 million  . The Company had   no   treasury stock withheld for taxes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the withholding and related repurchases of our common stock during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

(1) 
    All shares repurchased were surrendered by employees to settle tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock awards. 

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share  
    
  Basic net earnings or loss per common share is computed by dividing net earnings or loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the reporting period. Diluted net earnings or loss per share is computed by dividing net earnings or loss by the fully dilutive common stock equivalent, which consists of shares outstanding, augmented by potentially dilutive shares issuable upon the exercise of the Company's stock options, stock warrants, non-vested restricted stock awards, and conversion of the Convertible Subordinated Note, calculated using the treasury stock method.  
    
  The table below sets forth the number of stock options, stock warrants, non-vested restricted stock, and shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Subordinated Note that were excluded from dilutive shares outstanding during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as these securities are anti-dilutive because the Company was in a loss position during each period.  

Upon the occurrence of certain events, the Company is also contingently liable to make additional payments to Allied, under a Transfer Agreement entered into in November 2013 by the Company, its affiliates and Allied (the  Transfer Agreement ), up to an additional amount totaling   $50.0 million   in cash, or the equivalent in shares of the Company s common stock, at Allied s option. See   Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies   for further information.

Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The established framework for measuring fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and includes certain disclosure requirements. Fair value estimates are based on either (i) actual market data or (ii) assumptions that other market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including estimates of risk. 
    
  There are three levels of valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. The three levels are defined as follows: 
    
           Level 1 -  
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. The Company considers active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an on-going basis. 
       
           Level 2 -  
    Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the term, can be derived from observable data, or supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. 
       
           Level 3 -  
    Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement (including the Company s own assumptions in determining fair value). 
       
  The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, inventory, deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and debt at floating interest rates, approximate their fair values at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, principally due to the short-term nature, maturities or nature of interest rates of the above listed items.  
    
  Reclassification  
    
  Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2016 presentation. These reclassifications were not material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The Company is still evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.   ASU No. 2016-07 eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting. ASU No. 2016-07 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and the Company will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2017. The adoption of this standards update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Consideration (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).   ASU No. 2016-08 requires that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2016-08 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

December 15, 2017, and the Company will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this standards update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   The areas of simplification in ASU No. 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and the Company will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2017. The adoption of this standards update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.   ASU No. 2016-10 clarifies two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. ASU No. 2016-10 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and the Company will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this standards update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  . ASU No. 2016-11 rescinds SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas, effective upon adoption of Topic 606. ASU No. 2016-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and the Company will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this standards update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . The core principle of ASU No. 2016-12 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2016-12 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and the Company will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this standards update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in reporting certain items in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and the Company will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Adoption of Previously Issued ASUs 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts.  Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, the Company recorded and presented debt issuance costs as part of prepaids and other current assets, separate from the related debt liability. ASU 2015-03 does not change the recognition and measurement requirement for debt issuance costs. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the reclassification of approximately   $1.6 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Company's Term Loan Facility (see   Note 8 - Debt)   from prepaids and other current assets to current portion of long-term debt within its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015. Other than this reclassification, the adoption of ASU 2015-03  did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

3. Liquidity Matters and Going Concern 
    
  The Company incurred losses from operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's total current liabilities of   $274.6 million   exceeded its total current assets of   $19.4 million  , resulting in a working capital deficit of   $255.1 million  . As a result of the current low commodity prices and the Company s low oil production  
  
   10 

ERIN ENERGY CORPORATION  
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

volumes due to the recent mechanical problem which was resolved earlier in the year associated with well Oyo-8, the Company has not been able to generate sufficient cash from operations to satisfy certain obligations as they became due.  
    
  Well Oyo-7 is currently shut-in as a result of an emergency shut-in of the Oyo field production that occurred in early July of this year. This has resulted in a loss of approximately   1,400   BOPD. The Company   is currently working on various intervention options to restore production, including nitrogen lifting from the FPSO via subsea umbilical and/or relocating an existing gaslift line to Oyo-7 to enable continuous gaslift gas injection into the well.     
    
  The Company is currently pursuing a number of actions, including (i) obtaining additional funds through public or private financing sources, (ii) restructuring existing debts from lenders, (iii) obtaining forbearance of debt from trade creditors, (iv) reducing ongoing operating costs, (v) minimizing projected capital costs for the remainder of the 2016 exploration and development campaign and (vi) farming-out a portion of its rights to certain of its oil and gas properties. There can be no assurances that sufficient liquidity can be raised from one or more of these actions or that these actions can be consummated within the period needed to meet certain obligations. 
            The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that it will continue as a going concern, which assumes the continuity of operations, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business. Although the Company believes that it will be able to generate sufficient liquidity from the measures described above, its current circumstances raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue to operate as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

4. Property, Plant and Equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment were comprised of the following: 

All of the Company s oilfield assets are located offshore Nigeria in the Oil Mining Leases 120 and 121 (the "OMLs").  Work-in-progress and exploration inventory  includes suspended costs for wells that are not yet completed, as well as warehouse inventory items purchased as part of the redevelopment plan of the Oyo field. 
    
  The Company s unevaluated leasehold costs include costs to acquire the rights to the exploration acreage in its various oil and gas properties. 

5. Suspended Exploratory Well Costs - Work in Progress 
    
  In November 2013, the Company achieved both its primary and secondary drilling objectives for the well Oyo-7. The primary drilling objective was to establish production from the existing Pliocene reservoir. The secondary drilling objective was to confirm the presence of hydrocarbons in the deeper Miocene formation. Hydrocarbons were encountered in   three   Miocene intervals totaling approximately   65   feet, as interpreted by the logging-while-drilling ( LWD ) data. Plans are underway to secure a rig to drill at least one exploration well in the nearby G-Prospect. The primary objective of the G-Prospect is to target the same Miocene-age sediments as the ones found in the Oyo-7 exploratory drilling objective. Suspended exploratory well costs were   $26.5 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for the costs related to the Miocene exploratory drilling activities.

ERIN ENERGY CORPORATION  
  (formerly CAMAC ENERGY INC.) 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In August 2014, the Company drilled well Oyo-8 to a total vertical depth of approximately   6,059   feet (approximately   1,847   meters) and successfully encountered   four   new oil and gas reservoirs in the eastern fault block, with total gross hydrocarbon thickness of   112   feet, based on results from the LWD data, reservoir pressure measurement, and reservoir fluid sampling.

6. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities 
    
  The table below sets forth a summary of the Company s accounts payable and accrued liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

7. Asset Retirement Obligations 
    
  The Company s asset retirement obligations primarily represent the estimated fair value of the amounts that will be incurred to plug, abandon and remediate its producing properties at the end of their productive lives. Significant inputs used in determining such obligations include, but are not limited to, estimates of plugging and abandonment costs, estimated future inflation rates and changes in property lives. The inputs used in the fair value determination were based on Level 3 inputs, which were essentially management's assumptions. 
  On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the assumptions used to estimate the expected cash flows required to settle the asset retirement obligations, including changes in estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of the settlement of the asset retirement obligations, as well as changes in the legal obligation for each of its properties. Changes in any one or more of these assumptions may cause revisions in the estimated liabilities for the corresponding assets. The following summarizes changes in the Company s asset retirement obligations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  in thousands  ):

The 2016 Short-Term Note was renewed for another   30   days in July 2016 at a flat fee facility rate of   2.5%  , and was fully repaid in July 2016.  
    
  Long-Term Debt- Term Loan Facility  : 
    
  In September 2014, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary EPNL, entered into the Term Loan Facility (as amended or modified, the  Term Loan Facility ) with Zenith Bank PLC ("Zenith").    90.0%   of the Term Loan Facility was available in U.S. dollars, while the remaining   10%   was available in Nigerian Naira. U.S. dollar borrowings under the Term Loan Facility currently bear interest at the rate of   11.1%  . The obligations under the Term Loan Facility include a legal charge over the OMLs and an assignment of proceeds from oil sales. The obligations of EPNL have been guaranteed by the Company and rank in priority with all its other obligations. Proceeds from the Term Loan Facility were used for the further expansion and development of the Oyo field offshore Nigeria.  
    
  In June 2016, the Term Loan Facility was modified contingent upon the signing of a loan agreement, which was signed in August 2016. The modification put in place a   twelve   month moratorium on principal payments and extended the term of the Term Loan Facility until February 2021.  Additionally, it reduced the funding requirement of the debt service reserve account ( DSRA ) to an amount equal to one quarter of interest until the price of oil exceeds   $55   per barrel, at which time an amount equal to two quarters of interest will then be required. 
    
  Upon executing the Term Loan Facility, the Company paid fees totaling   $2.6 million  .  Upon modification of the Term Loan Facility, additional fees of   $1.4 million   were incurred. These fees were recorded as debt issuance cost and are being amortized over the life of the Term Loan Facility using the effective interest method.   As of September 30, 2016  ,   $2.5 million   of the debt issuance costs remained unamortized.  
    
  Under the Term Loan Facility, the following events, among others, constitute events of default: EPNL failing to pay any amounts due within   thirty days   of the due date; bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or dissolution of EPNL; a material breach of the Term Loan Facility by EPNL that remains unremedied within   thirty days   of written notice by EPNL; or a representation or warranty of EPNL proves to have been incorrect or materially inaccurate when made. Upon any event of default, all outstanding principal and interest under any loans will become immediately due and payable. Further, Zenith has the right to review the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Facility. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company made payments of   $0.9 million   and   $5.6 million   for the principal repayment of the Naira portion of the loan and for the U.S. dollar principal, respectively.  
    
  As of September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized an unrealized foreign currency gain of   $4.4 million   on the Naira portion of the loan, reducing the balance under the Term Loan Facility to   $86.2 million  , net of debt discount. Of this amount,   $78.1 million   was classified as long-term and   $8.1 million   as short-term. Accrued interest for the Term Loan Facility was   $0.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Scheduled principal repayments on the outstanding balance on the Term Loan Facility are as follows (  in thousands  ):

The complaint alleges the February 2014 Transactions were unfair to the Company and purports to assert derivative claims against (1) the   seven   individuals who served on our Board at the time of the February 2014 Transactions and (2) our majority shareholder, CEHL. The complaint also purports to assert a direct breach of fiduciary duty claim on behalf of the putative class against the   seven   individuals who served on our Board at the time of the February 2014 Transactions on the grounds that they purportedly caused the Company to disseminate a false and misleading proxy statement in connection with the February 2014 Transactions, and a direct claim for aiding and abetting against Dr. Kase Lawal, the former Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The plaintiff is seeking, on behalf of the Company and the putative class, an undisclosed amount of compensatory damages.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

13. Correction of Immaterial Error in Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statement Information 
    
  Prior to the filing of the Company's September 30, 2016 Form 10-Q, the management of the Company determined that the impairment calculation of its oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2015 did not exclude estimated  future cash flows related to future abandonment costs. As a result, the Company is revising certain of its consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   to correct this error.  This correction will be reflected accordingly as they are included in future filings. This prior year error correction did not change the net cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities previously reported. The effect of this correction on capital deficiency as of   December 31, 2015   was a reduction of   $20.6 million  , as reflected in the Statement of Capital Deficiency as of   December 31, 2015  . After considering Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99,   Assessing Materiality,   management does not deem this revision to be material to its consolidated financial statements due to its consideration of the amount and direction of the error and its impact on the quality of key oil and natural gas industry financial metrics.  
    
  As a result of the correction, originally reported net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was decreased by   $20.6 million  , and originally reported basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was decreased by   $0.09   per share.   
    
  The following table reflects certain amounts within the consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations, and cash flows as originally reported to amounts as now reflected as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
  Our Business 
    
  Erin Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused on energy resources in Africa. Our strategy is to acquire and develop high-potential exploration and production assets in Africa, and to explore and develop those assets through strategic partnerships with national oil companies, indigenous local partners and other independent oil companies. We seek to build and operate a strategic portfolio of high-impact exploration and near-term development projects with significant production, reserves and resources growth potential.  
    
  We actively manage investments and on-going operations by limiting capital exposure through farm-outs at various stages of exploration and development to share risks and costs. We prioritize on building a strong technical and operational team and place an emphasis on the utilization of modern oil field technologies that mature our assets, reduce the cost of our projects and improve the efficiency of our operations.  
    
  Our shares are traded on both the NYSE MKT and on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ("JSE") under the symbol  ERN . 
    
  Our asset portfolio consists of   nine   licenses across   four   countries covering an area of approximately   10 million   acres (approximately   40,000   square kilometers). We own producing properties offshore Nigeria and conduct exploration activities as an operator offshore Nigeria and conduct exploration activities as an operator onshore and offshore Kenya, offshore The Gambia, and offshore Ghana.  
    
  Our operating subsidiaries include Erin Petroleum Nigeria Limited, Erin Energy Kenya Limited, Erin Energy Gambia Ltd., and Erin Energy Ghana Limited.  
    
  We conduct certain business transactions with our majority shareholder, CAMAC Energy Holdings Limited ( CEHL ) and its affiliates, which include CAMAC Nigeria Limited ( CNL ) and Allied. See   Note 9 - Related Party Transactions   to the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  
    
  In May 2016, Dr. Kase L. Lawal retired from service as a member and Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. John Hofmeister, a then current member of our Board of Directors, succeeded Dr. Lawal as the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Segun Omidele, our then Chief Operating Officer, succeeded Dr. Lawal as the Chief Executive Officer. 
    
  Nigeria 
    
  The Company currently owns 100% of the economic interests in the Oil Mineral Leases ("OMLs"), which include the currently pro  ducing Oyo field.  
    
  In early May 2016, with the help of a light intervention vessel, the Company successfully completed well repair operations to resolve the mechanical problem related to well Oyo-8 and successfully resumed production from the well.  In early July 2016, well Oyo-7 was shut-in as a result of an emergency shut-in of the Oyo field production. This has resulted in a loss of approximately 1,400 BOPD. The Company is currently working on various intervention options to restore production, including nitrogen lifting from the FPSO via subsea umbilical and/or relocating an existing gaslift line to Oyo-7 to enable continuous gaslift gas injection into the well. 
    
  Daily production mainly from well Oyo-8 during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately 6,900 BOPD (approximately 6,100 BOPD net to the Company after royalty).  
    
  Current plans include drilling a development well in the Oyo field, and drilling an exploration well in the Miocene formation of the OMLs, subject to capital and rig availability. 
    
  Kenya 
    
  In May 2012, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, entered into four production sharing contracts with the Government of the Republic of Kenya, covering onshore exploration blocks L1B and L16, and offshore exploration blocks L27 and L28 (the  Kenya PSCs ). Each block requires specific work commitments to be completed by the end of the respective license periods. The Company is the operator of all blocks with the Government having the right to participate up to 20%, either directly or through an appointee, in any area subsequent to declaration of a commercial discovery. The Company is responsible for all exploration expenditures. 

22 

The Company is currently in the First Additional Exploration Period for both onshore blocks, which will last through July 2017. In accordance with the Kenya PSCs, the Company is obligated, for each block, to (i) acquire, process and interpret high density 300 square kilometer 3-D seismic data at a minimum expenditure of $12.0 million and (ii) drill one exploration well to a minimum depth of 3,000 meters at a minimum expenditure of $20.0 million. The Company plans to pursue completion of the work program and is considering the possibility of farming-out a portion of its rights to both blocks to potential partners. 
    
  In August 2015, the Company received approval from the Kenya Ministry of Energy and Petroleum for an 18-month extension of the Initial Exploration Period for offshore blocks L27 and L28, which will now last through February 2017. The remaining contractual obligation under the initial exploration period is for the Company to acquire, process and interpret 1,500 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data over both offshore blocks. The Company plans to pursue completion of the work program, and is also considering the possibility of farming-out a portion of its rights to both offshore blocks to potential partners. Upon completion of the work program, the Company has the right to apply for up to two additional two-year exploration periods, with specified additional minimum work obligations, including the acquisition of seismic data and the drilling of one exploratory well on each block during each additional period. 
    
  The Gambia 
    
  In May 2012, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, signed two Petroleum Exploration, Development   Production Licenses with The Republic of The Gambia, for offshore exploration blocks A2 and A5 (the  Gambia Licenses ). For both blocks, the Company is the operator, with the Gambian National Petroleum Company ( GNPCo ) having the right to elect to participate up to a 15% interest, following approval of a development and production plan. The Company is responsible for all expenditures prior to such approval even if the GNPCo elects to participate.  
    
  The term of the initial exploration period for both blocks A2 and A5, now extended through December 2018, require for the Company to (i) complete the processing and interpretation of approximately 1,500 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data that was acquired in September 2015 and (ii) drill one exploration well on either block A2 or A5 and evaluate the drilling results. The 3-D seismic processing by an outside contractor was completed in the third quarter of 2016, and will be available to the Company upon final payment of the amounts described in the last paragraph of   Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies under      Legal Contingencies and Proceedings"  . The Company intends to pursue completion of the work program, and is also considering the possibility of farming-out a portion of its rights to both blocks to potential partners. 
    
  Ghana 
    
  In April 2014, the Company, through an indirect 50%-owned subsidiary, signed a Petroleum Agreement with the Republic of Ghana (the  Petroleum Agreement ) relating to the Expanded Shallow Water Tano block offshore Ghana ("ESWT"). The Contracting Parties, which hold 90% of the participating interest in the block, are Erin Energy Ghana Limited as the operator, GNPC Exploration and Production Company Limited, and Base Energy (collectively the  Contracting Parties ), holding 60%, 25%, and 15% share of the participating interest of the Contracting Parties, respectively. The Ghana National Petroleum Corporation initially has a 10% carried interest through the exploration phase, and will have the option to acquire an additional paying interest of up to 10% following a declaration of commercial discovery. The Company owns 50% of its subsidiary Erin Energy Ghana Limited. The remaining 50% interest is owned by an affiliate of the Company s majority shareholder.  
    
  The ESWT block contains three previously discovered fields (the "Fields") and the work program requires the Contracting Parties to determine, within nine months of the effective date of the Petroleum Agreement, the economic viability of developing the Fields. In addition, the Petroleum Agreement provides for an initial exploration period of two years from the effective date of the Petroleum Agreement, with specified work obligations during that period, including the reprocessing of existing 2-D and 3-D seismic data and the drilling of one exploration well on the ESWT block.  
    
  The Petroleum Agreement became effective in January 2015. Having completed the initial technical and commercial evaluation of the Fields, the Contracting Parties concluded that certain fiscal terms in the Petroleum Agreement had to be adjusted in order to achieve commerciality of the Fields under current economic conditions. The Contracting Parties have presented this conclusion to the relevant government entities. The Ghanian Government is currently reviewing the requests for adjustment of the fiscal terms, and has granted Erin Energy an extension of the Initial Exploration Period for eighteen months until the end of July 2018.

Results of Operations 
  The following discussion pertains to the Company s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and should be read together with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in this report, and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed on March 24, 2016 with the SEC. 
    
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  Revenues 
    
  Revenue is recognized when an oil lifting occurs. Crude oil revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $28.6 million  , as compared to   $28.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold approximately 583,000 net barrels of oil at an average price of $49.07/Bbl. For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company sold approximately 571,000 net barrels of oil at an average price of $50.2/Bbl. 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the average daily production from the Oyo field, net of royalty, over the number of days production occurred, was approximately 6,100 BOPD and 10,200 BOPD, respectively.  
    
  Operating Costs and Expenses 
    
  Production costs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $24.9 million  , as compared to   $27.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . Production costs include costs directly related to the production of hydrocarbons. In June 2015, the operator of the FPSO agreed to a price reduction for the operating day rates incurred by the Company for the period of July 2014 through April 2015, which resulted in a $26.0 million reduction in production costs recognized in June 2015. There was no such reduction in 2016.  The Company matches production expenses with crude oil sales. Any production expenses associated with unsold crude oil inventory are capitalized with a corresponding offset to operating costs. The capitalized crude oil inventory costs are subsequently expensed when crude oil is sold.  
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $0.2 million   of workover expenses, as compared to workover expenses  of   $0.4 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in workover expenses in 2016 compared to the same period   2015   was due to the repair in 2015 of a control module associated with its well Oyo-4 that is currently operating as a gas injection well. 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $1.7 million   of exploration expenses, including $0.4 million spent in Kenya, $0.4 million spent in Nigeria, $0.2 million spent in Ghana, and $0.7 million spent in The Gambia. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred   $5.3 million   of exploration expenses, including $0.8 million spent in Kenya, $3.9 million in The Gambia primarily for 3-D seismic acquisition, and $0.4 million spent in Ghana. 
    
  Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD A ) expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , were   $18.9 million  , as compared to   $43.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . DD A expenses were higher during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due to the higher depletion rates in   2015   as compared to that in 2016. The average depletion rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was $28.55/Bbl, as compared to $66.74/Bbl in the same period in   2015  .  The decrease in the average depletion rate in 2016 as compared to 2015 was mainly due to the impairment of oil and gas properties recorded at December 31, 2015,  
    
  Accretion of asset retirement obligations ("ARO") for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 was   $0.5 million  . ARO accretion expense for both 2016 and 2015 relates to the development of wells Oyo-7 and Oyo-8. 
    
  There was no plug and abandonment ("P A") activity during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . In April 2015, the Company completed P A activities for well Oyo-6 that was previously shut-in. Actual P A expenditures exceeded estimated P A liabilities by   $0.8 million  . Accordingly, the Company recognized a   $0.8 million   loss on settlement of its ARO during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .   
    
  General and administrative ("G A") expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $3.6 million  , as compared to   $3.9 million   in the same period in   2015  . G A decreased in 2016 mainly due to the cost reduction initiatives implemented during 2016, primarily related to employee costs and professional and consulting fees. 

24 

Other Income (Expense), Net 
  Other expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.8 million  , consisting of    $5.0 million   interest expense on borrowings, partially offset by a   $3.3 million   gain on foreign currency transactions. Other expense for the same period in   2015   was   $5.5 million   consisting of   $5.7 million   in interest expense on borrowings, partially offset by a   $0.2 million   gain on foreign currency transactions. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income taxes were nil for each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company did not have any taxable income from its oil and gas activities in Nigeria in these respective periods. 
    
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to nine months ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  Revenues 
    
  Revenue is recognized when an oil lifting occurs. Crude oil revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $56.7 million  , as compared to   $28.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold approximately 1,253,000 net barrels of oil at an average price of $45.27/Bbl. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company sold approximately 571,000 net barrels of oil at an average price of $50.20/Bbl. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the average daily production from the Oyo field, net of royalty, over the number of days production occurred, was approximately 4,500 BOPD and 8,700 BOPD, respectively.  
    
  Operating Costs and Expenses 
    
  Production costs for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $69.6 million  , as compared to expenditures of   $53.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . Production costs include costs directly related to the production of hydrocarbons. In June 2015, the operator of the FPSO agreed to a price reduction for the operating day rates incurred by the Company for the period of July 2014 through April 2015, which resulted in a $26.0 million reduction in production costs recognized in June 2015. There was no such reduction in 2016. The Company matches production expenses with crude oil sales. Any production expenses associated with unsold crude oil inventory are capitalized with a corresponding offset to operating costs. The capitalized crude oil inventory costs are subsequently expensed when crude oil is sold.  
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $7.8 million   of workover expenses, as compared to expenditures of   $1.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in workover expenses is due to the light intervention of well Oyo-8. During the same period   2015  , the Company spent   $1.0 million   to repair a control module associated with its well Oyo-4 that is currently operating as a gas injection well. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $4.9 million   of exploration expenses, including $1.2 million spent in Ghana, $1.4 million spent in Kenya, $1.1 million spent in Nigeria, and $1.2 million spent in The Gambia. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred   $13.3 million   of exploration expenses, including $6.9 million spent in Kenya primarily for the 2-D seismic acquisition and processing, $4.6 million spent in The Gambia primarily for 3-D seismic acquisition, $1.3 million spent in Ghana, and $0.4 million spent in Nigeria. 
    
  DD A expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were   $38.6 million  , as compared to   $43.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . DD A expenses were higher during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   mainly due to the higher depletion rates in   2015   as compared to that in 2016. The average depletion rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was $30.81/Bbl, as compared to $76.26/Bbl in the same period in   2015  . The decrease in the average depletion rate in 2016 as compared to 2015 was mainly due to the impairment of oil and gas properties recorded at December 31, 2015,  
    
  Accretion of ARO for both the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.4 million  . 
    
  The Company recorded P A expenses of   $0.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  In April 2015, the Company completed P A activities for well Oyo-6 that was previously shut-in. Additional P A expenditures paid in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , in relation to well Oyo-6 P A activities were   $4.2 million  . Accordingly, the Company recognized this cost as a loss on settlement of its ARO during   2015  .  
  
   25 

G A expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $11.0 million  , as compared to   $12.8 million   in the same period in   2015  . G A decreased in 2016 mainly due to the cost reduction initiatives implemented during 2016, primarily related to employee costs and professional and consulting fees. 
    
  Other Income (Expense), Net 
  Other expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.8 million  , consisting of   $16.4 million   interest expense on borrowings, partially offset by a   $14.6 million   gain on foreign currency transactions. Other expense for the same period in   2015   was   $10.3 million  , consisting of   $12.5 million   in interest expense on borrowings, net of $2.2 million capitalized interest, partially offset by   $2.2 million   gain on foreign currency transactions.  The increase in interest expense was mainly due to the increase in the average outstanding borrowings during 2016 as compared to 2015, and that no interest was capitalized during 2016. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income taxes were nil for each of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company did not have any taxable income from its oil and gas activities in Nigeria in these respective periods. 
    
  Headline Earnings  
    
  In addition to the Company s primary listing on the NYSE MKT, the Company s common stock is also traded on the JSE. The JSE requires the Company to file certain documents that it files with the SEC. The JSE also requires that we calculate Headline Earnings Per Share ( HEPS ) which, per the SEC, is considered a non-GAAP measurement. 
  As defined in the Circular 3/2009 of The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, headline earnings is an additional earnings number that excludes certain separately identifiable re-measurements, net of related tax, and related non-controlling interest. 
  The number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted HEPS is the same as basic and diluted EPS. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no separate identifiable re-measurements required and headline earnings was the same as net loss per share as disclosed on the unaudited consolidated statements of operations. Therefore, HEPS for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was a loss of   $(0.11)   and   $(0.28)  , respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was a loss of   $(0.37)   and   $(0.48)  , respectively. 

Liquidity 
    
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $6.7 million   for the period, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of   $16.1 million   in the prior period. Cash used in operating activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   $22.8 million   as compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a combination of higher revenues, use of vendor financing and higher non-cash adjustments to net loss. 
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  Cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $16.5 million  , as compared to   $83.2 million   for the same period in 2015. Cash used in investing activities for both periods was used primarily to settle outstanding liabilities associated with additions to property, plant, and equipment for the Oyo field redevelopment campaign in the OMLs. 
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities of   $5.6 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , consisted of    $6.1 million   funds released from restricted cash,   $6.8 million   inflows from short-term borrowings from related parties,   $0.5 million   proceeds from a short-term note payable, and   $0.4 million   proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by   $6.5 million   principal repayment of our Term Loan Facility,   $1.0 million   payment for debt issuance costs,   $0.4 million    repayment of short-term note payable, and   $0.2 million   payment to settle withholding tax obligations upon vesting of restricted stock awards.  Net cash provided by financing activities of   $77.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   consisted of $63.8 million  
  
   26 

borrowings from related parties, $11.3 million advance from Glencore, $1.9 million proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants, and $0.6 million in funding from an entity owning a non-controlling interest in the Company's Ghana subsidiary. 
    
  Capital Resources 
    
  Our primary cash requirements are for capital expenditures for the continued development of the Oyo field in Nigeria, operating expenditures for the Oyo field, exploration activities in unevaluated leaseholds, working capital needs, and interest and principal payments under current indebtedness. 
    
  We incurred losses from operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's total current liabilities of   $274.6 million   exceeded its total current assets of   $19.4 million  , resulting in a working capital deficit of   $255.1 million  . As a result of the current low commodity prices and our low oil production volumes due to the recent mechanical problem which was resolved earlier in the year associated with well Oyo-8, we have not been able to generate sufficient cash from operations to satisfy certain obligations as they became due. 
            Well Oyo-7 is currently shut-in as a result of an emergency shut-in of the Oyo field production that occurred in early July of this year. This has resulted in a loss of approximately 1,400 BOPD. We are currently working on various intervention options to restore production, including nitrogen lifting from the FPSO via subsea umbilical and/or relocating an existing gaslift line to Oyo-7 to enable continuous gaslift gas injection into the well. 
    
  We are currently pursuing a number of actions, including (i) obtaining additional funds through public or private financing sources, (ii) restructuring existing debts from lenders, (iii) obtaining forbearance of debt from trade creditors, (iv) reducing ongoing operating costs, (v) minimizing projected capital costs for the remainder of the 2016 exploration and development campaign and (vi) farming-out a portion of our rights to certain of our oil and gas properties. There can be no assurances that sufficient liquidity can be raised from one or more of these actions or that these actions can be consummated within the period needed to meet certain obligations. 
    
  In February 2016, we lifted and sold approximately 183,000 Bbls of crude oil (approximately 161,000 Bbls net to the Company). Net proceeds to us were approximately $4.9 million.  
    
  In April 2016, we lifted and sold approximately 159,000 Bbls of crude oil (approximately 140,000 Bbls net to the Company). Net proceeds to us were approximately $5.6 million. 
    
  In June 2016, we lifted and sold approximately 418,000 Bbls of crude oil (approximately 368,000 Bbls net to the Company). Net proceeds to us were approximately $17.6 million.  
    
  In August 2016, we lifted and sold approximately 431,000 Bbls of crude oil (approximately 379,000 Bbls net to the Company). Net proceeds to us were approximately $18.9 million. 
    
  In September 2016, we lifted and sold approximately 232,000 Bbls of crude oil (approximately 204,000 Bbls net to the Company). Net proceeds to us were approximately $9.8 million.  
    
  Although we believe that we will be able to generate sufficient liquidity from the measures described above, our current circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue to realize the carrying value of our assets and operate as a going concern.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  From time-to-time, we may enter into arrangements that can give rise to off-balance sheet obligations.   As of September 30, 2016  , material off-balance sheet obligations include operating leases for the FPSO and certain employment contracts. Other than the material off-balance sheet arrangements discussed above, no other arrangements are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results from operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected  
  
   27 

revenues, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company, to be materially different from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected or any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this report. 
    
  In addition, forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as  anticipate,   believe,   continue,   could,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   goal,   intend,   may,   objective,   plan,   potential,   predict,   project,   should,   will,   will likely,  or similar expressions. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Important factors that could affect our financial performance and that could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to: 

the supply, demand and market prices of oil and natural gas; 
                
    our current and future indebtedness; 
                
    our ability to raise capital to fund our current and future operations; 
                
    our ability to develop oil and gas reserves; 
                
    competition from other companies in the energy market; 
                
    political instability and foreign government regulations over international operations; 
                
    our lack of diversification of production and reserves; 
                
    compliance and enforcement of restriction on production and exports; 
                
    compliance and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations; 
                
    our ability to achieve profitability; 
                
    our dependency on third parties to enable us to produce and deliver oil and gas; and 
                
    other factors disclosed under   Item 1. Description of Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 2. Properties, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and elsewhere in this report. 
       
  We have based our forward-looking statements on our management s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that assumptions, beliefs, expectations, intentions and projections about future events may and often do vary materially from actual results. Therefore, we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. 
    
  For a detailed description of these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of Part II of this report and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by reference to these risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and, except as required by law, we undertake no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statement. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  The Company may be exposed to certain market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange, interest rates, and commodity prices. 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
    
  Our results of operations and financial conditions are affected by currency exchange rates. While oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, portions of our capital and operating costs in Nigeria are denominated in Naira, the Nigerian local currency. Similarly, portions of our exploration costs in Kenya, The Gambia, and Ghana are denominated in each country s respective local currency.  

28 

Historically, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currencies in the countries in which we operate has fluctuated widely in response to international political conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors beyond our control.  
    
  The weighted average exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Nigerian Naira was 189.38 Naira per each U.S. dollar for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a 10% fluctuation in the weighted average exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Nigerian Naira would have had an approximate $4.6 million impact on our capital and operating costs in Nigeria. 
    
  To date, we have not engaged in hedging activities to hedge our foreign currency exposure in our foreign operations. In the future, we may enter into hedging instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange risk or continue to be subject to exchange rate risk. 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  As an independent oil producer, our revenue, other income and profitability, reserve values, access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil. Prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. Prices received for oil production have been volatile and unpredictable, and such volatility is expected to continue. 
    
  Historically, realized commodity prices received for our crude oil sales have been tied to the Brent oil prices. Prices received have been volatile and unpredictable. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a $10.00 fluctuation in the prices received for our crude oil sales would have had an approximate $12.5 million impact on our revenues. 
    
  We do not currently engage in hedging activities to hedge our exposure to commodity price risks. In the future, we may enter into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily from possible fluctuations in the London Interbank Borrowing Rate ( LIBOR ). The interest rates on our debt obligations are stated at floating rates tied to the LIBOR. Currently, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was 9.2%. Assuming our current level of borrowings, a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates we pay under our various debt facilities would result in an increase of our interest expense by $2.2 million over a twelve month period. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  
   29 

The disclosures required in this Item 1 are included in   Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies   in the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Financial Information, Item 1, Financial Statements and incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  The following risk factors update the Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016 for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  Annual Report ). Except as set forth below, there have not been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report. 
    
  We have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt. Higher levels of indebtedness make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $50.0 million   outstanding in aggregate principal under the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note,   $47.7 million  , net of discount, under the 2015 Convertible Note,   $86.2 million  , net of discount, under the Term Loan Facility,   $24.9 million   under the 2011 Promissory Note, and   $6.4 million   under a 2016 Promissory Note, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness has, or could have, important consequences to our business because: 

a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; 
                
    it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes; 
                
    it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and 
                
    we may be substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. 
       
  In addition, the terms of the Term Loan Facility restrict, and the terms of any future indebtedness including any future credit facility may restrict, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and grant liens because of debt or financial covenants we are, or may be, required to meet. Thus, we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to grow our business or implement our business strategy and may lose opportunities to acquire interests in oil properties or related businesses because of our inability to fund such growth. 
    
  Our ability to comply with restrictions and covenants, including those in the Term Loan Facility or in any future credit facility, is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in the Term Loan Facility could result in a default, which could permit the lenders to accelerate repayments and foreclose on the collateral securing such indebtedness. 
    
  Events of default may occur under the Allied related party notes, subject to waivers entered into by the Company and Allied in March 2016 and as subsequently amended. If events of default occur or Allied accelerates the repayment obligations, as to matters not covered or no longer covered by the waivers, cross-defaults will exist under the Allied related party notes, and we will not be able to repay the obligations that become immediately due. 
    
  Allied, a related party, is the holder of the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note, the 2015 Convertible Note, and the 2011 Promissory Note (collectively the "Allied Notes"). Each of the Allied Notes contains certain default and cross-default provisions, including failure to pay interest and principal amounts when due and default under other indebtedness. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was not in compliance with the default provisions of each of the Allied Notes with respect to the payment of quarterly interest. Further, the risk of cross-default exists for each of the Allied Notes if the holder of the Term Loan Facility exercises its right to terminate the Term Loan Facility and accelerate its maturity. Allied agreed to waive its rights under all default provisions of each of the Allied Notes through December 2017. For additional information regarding defaults, cross-defaults and potential cross-defaults, please see the discussion regarding each debt instrument in   Note 8 - Debt   to the financial statements included herein. If any of our debt obligations are accelerated due to the events of default or future cross-defaults, we may not be able to repay the obligations that become immediately due and will have severe liquidity restraints. 
    
  Due to lack of liquidity, we may not be able to make the required principal and interest payments under the Term Loan Facility due quarterly beginning June 1, 2017. 

30 

As a result of the current low commodity prices and a prior history of low oil production volumes related to mechanical problems with well Oyo-8, the Company has not been able to generate sufficient cash from operations to satisfy certain obligations as they become due. The Company has been relying on short-term promissory notes, such as the 2016 Promissory Note, with an entity related to the Company s majority shareholder to supplement its liquidity needs, but there can be no assurances that the related party will continue to provide such short-term loans in the future. 
    
  Pursuant to the Term Loan Facility, Zenith has the right to review the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Facility.  
    
  Our failure to make the required payments under the Term Loan Facility, maturing in 2021, or to comply with its applicable debt covenants could result in a default under the Term Loan Facility and a cross-default under the Allied Notes as described in the preceding risk factor, which could result in the acceleration of the payment of such debt, termination of Zenith s commitments to make further loans to us, loss of our ownership interests in the secured properties or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, if we are unable to service our debt obligations generally, we cannot assure you that the Company will continue in its current state or continue to operate as a going concern. 
    
  We may be unable to continue as a going concern. 
    
  As mentioned in the risk factors above, we have substantial debt obligations and may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity throughout 2016. As a result, the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared under the assumption that it will continue as a going concern, which assumes the continuity of operations, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Although the Company believes that it will be able to generate sufficient liquidity, its current circumstances raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue to operate as a going concern. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we borrowed an additional   $0.5 million   under the 2015 Convertible Note and issued to Allied warrants to purchase approximately   48,291   shares of the Company's common stock with an exercise price ranging from   $2.00   to   $2.13   per share. For further information, see   Note 8 - Debt   to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 5. Other Information 
    
  Effective May 26, 2016 and executed on July 11, 2016, the Company and Mr. Babatunde (Segun) Omidele entered into an Employment Offer Letter (the  Omidele Employment Agreement ) that replaced and superseded the prior employment offer letter, dated as of September 1, 2011, between Mr. Omidele and the Company. The Omidele Employment Agreement sets forth the definitive terms of the compensation arrangements previously disclosed in the Company s Form 8-K filed March 17, 2016. Pursuant to the Omidele Employment Agreement, Mr. Omidele, while serving as the Chief Executive Officer, receives an annual base salary of $350,000. Mr. Omidele is also eligible for a discretionary cash performance bonus each year targeted at between 0% and 100% of his then-current base salary, as well as additional equity grants valued at up to 200% of his then-current base salary, at the discretion of the Company s Board. In addition, if the Company terminates Mr. Omidele s employment without Cause (as defined in the Omidele Employment Agreement), (i) the Company must pay to Mr. Omidele an amount equal to the two times base salary plus target annual bonus as determined by the Board for the year of termination, and (ii) any outstanding restricted stock and stock options will have their vesting period immediately accelerated by 24 months, with all vested Company stock options (including accelerated options) remaining exercisable for a period of 24 months following the date of separation, in exchange for a full release of all claims against the Company and its related parties The agreement also includes confidentiality, noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants.  
    
  Further, the Company and Mr. Omidele entered into on November 14, 2016 a Retention Bonus Agreement (the  Retention Bonus Agreement ). Pursuant to the Retention Bonus Agreement, the Company will pay Mr. Omidele a bonus equal to two times his then-current annual base salary, as defined in the Omidele Employment Agreement, on May 26, 2019 if he is still employed by the Company on that date. The Company will pay such bonus in twenty-four equal monthly installments commencing on the last day of the first month following the termination of Mr. Omidele s employment with the Company. If his employment with the Company is terminated at any time before May 26, 2019, for any reason, the right to the bonus, or any portion thereof, will lapse and be forfeited.

  Katy, TX 77450 
    
  Re: Offer of Employment as Chief Executive Officer 
    
  Dear Mr. Omidele: 
  It is our pleasure to extend to you on behalf of Erin Energy Corporation (the  Company ), an offer of employment as the Company s Chief Executive Officer commencing as of May 26, 2016 in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in this letter agreement (the  Agreement ), the adequacy and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged:  
  1.  DUTIES  . The Company requires that you be available to perform the duties of Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the Job Description attached hereto, and other functions as may be determined and assigned by your supervisor and the Board of Directors of the Company (the  Board ) and as may be required by the Company s constituent instruments, including its certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws and its corporate governance, each as amended or modified from time to time, and by applicable law, including the Delaware General Corporation Law.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right, to the extent the Company from time to time reasonably deems necessary or appropriate, to change your position or reporting relationship, and to expand or reduce your duties and responsibilities. You will report to the Board and you agree to devote as much time as is necessary to discharge and perform completely the duties described in this Section 1, and perform such other duties as the Board may from time to time assign to you.  The location of your employment shall be the Company s office in Houston, Texas.  The Company will require you to travel frequently, including to Africa.   
  2.        TERM  . The term of this Agreement shall commence on May 26, 2016, and shall continue until your employment is terminated by the Company or by you.  
  3.        COMPENSATION  . For all services to be rendered by you to the Company in any capacity hereunder, the Company agrees to pay you the following compensation: 
           a. 
    Your initial base salary during the term of your employment with the Company will be US$350,000.00 per annum (the  Base Salary ), paid in arrears and in equal installments in accordance with the customary payroll practices of the Company.  Your Base Salary will be reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee of the Board. 
              b. 
    You will be reviewed by the Board, not less than annually, and in connection with such review, will be eligible for a discretionary cash performance bonus each year targeted at between 0% to 100%, and an annual long-term incentive equity award valued at up to 200% of your then-current annual base salary, based on defined targets determined by the Board.

  Page 2 of 2 

of restricted stock and options in the Board s sole discretion.  You acknowledge that the Company is not obligated to award you any cash or equity bonus in any year. 
  You agree that if any payment of compensation paid to you by the Company or any affiliate, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, results in income or wages to you for federal, state, local or foreign income, employment or other tax purposes with respect to which the Company or any affiliate has a withholding obligation, the Company and its affiliates are authorized to withhold from such payment and any other cash, stock, property or other remuneration then or thereafter payable to you in any capacity any tax required to be withheld by reason of such income or wages. 
  4.        EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
           a. 
    You shall be eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs and policies maintained by the Company for similarly situated employees in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans, programs, and policies as in effect from time to time. 
              b. 
    In accordance with and subject to the terms of the Company s expense reimbursement policy, the Company shall pay or reimburse you for reasonable expenses actually incurred or paid by you in the performance of your services hereunder upon the presentation of expense statements or vouchers or such other appropriate supporting information as the Company may reasonably require of you.

Your rights to any reimbursements are not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  The amount of expense reimbursements for which you are eligible during any taxable year will not affect the amount of any expense reimbursements for which you are eligible in any other taxable year.

including, without limitation, the United States of America, having jurisdiction over you, the Company or any of the Company s subsidiaries.  
  8.        AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT.    You should understand that your employment with the Company may be terminated by you or the Company at any time and for any reason.  No provision of this Agreement or any other agreement with the Company shall be construed to create a promise of employment for any specific period of time.  This Agreement supersedes in its entirety any and all prior agreements and understandings concerning your employment relationship with the Company, whether written or oral.   
  9.        TERMINATION  . 
           a. 
    With or without cause, you and the Company may each terminate this Agreement at any time after thirty (30) days advance written notice, and the Company will be obligated to pay you the compensation and expenses due up to the date of your Separation from Service.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Company will pay to you an amount equal to two times the Base Salary plus target annual bonus as determined by the Board for the year in which Separation from Service occurs (the  Separation Payment ) if you incur a Separation from Service due to your termination by the Company without  Cause  or as a result of a company other than CAMAC International Limited acquiring Control and shall also provide the benefits described in Section 9.b. below, and immediately accelerate by twenty-four (24) months the vesting of all outstanding Company restricted stock and options exercisable for Company Stock then held by you, with all vested Company options held by you (including accelerated options) remaining exercisable for a period of twenty-four (24) months following your date of Separation from Service, in exchange for a full and complete release of claims against the Company, its affiliates, officers and directors in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the  Release ),  which Release has become irrevocable.   Control  means the direct or indirect ownership of an aggregate fifty percent (50%) or more of voting capital or voting rights of or the entitlement (directly or indirectly) to appoint a majority of the directors or equivalent management body of, or the ability to direct the policies or operations of the other entity.  For purposes of this provision,  Cause  means your (i) conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony or any other crime involving moral turpitude; (ii) fraud on or misappropriation of any funds or property of the Company or any of its affiliates, customers or vendors; (iii)  willful violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation (other than minor traffic violations or similar offenses), or breach of fiduciary duty; (iv) willful failure to perform your responsibilities in the best interests of the Company or any of its affiliates; (v) illegal use or distribution of drugs; (vi) material violation of any rule, regulation, procedure or policy of the Company or any of its affiliates; or (vii) material breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other employment, non-disclosure, non-competition, non-solicitation or other similar agreement executed by you for the benefit of the Company or any of its affiliates, all as determined by the Board or the Company s affiliate (as the case may be), which determination will be conclusive.  The Separation Payment is intended to qualify as separation pay due to involuntary Separation from Service under Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii).  To the extent the Separation Payment, or any portion thereof, so qualifies or is otherwise exempt from the requirements of Section 409A, such amount shall be paid in 24 equal monthly installments on the last day of each of the first 24 months  
     
   4 

Mr.   Babatunde Omidele 
  Page 5 of 5 

following the month of your Separation from Service, subject to the Release becoming irrevocable.  If all or any portion of the Separation Payment does not qualify as separation pay due to involuntary Separation from Service under Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) and is not otherwise exempt from the requirements of Section 409A such amount shall be paid as follows:  (a) if you are not a Specified Employee, such amount shall be paid in 24 equal monthly installments on the last day of each of the first 24 months following the month of your Separation from Service or (b) if you are a Specified Employee, such amount shall be paid in 18 monthly installments beginning the date that is six months following the date of your Separation from Service (and the first payment shall include all amounts that would have been paid to you earlier under this section had you not been a Specified Employee).  For purposes of this Agreement, the terms    Separation from Service    and    Specified Employee    have the meanings ascribed to those terms in Section 409A. 
           b. 
    If (i) your employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without  Cause  as described in Section 9(a), (ii) you are an active participant in the Company s group medical plan (the  Group Medical Plan ) on the date of your employment terminates, (iii) you timely elect to continue that Group Medical Plan coverage under section 4980B of the Code ( COBRA Continuation Coverage ), and (iv) you execute and do not revoke the Release, the Company will reimburse you, the excess, if any, of the amount you pay to the Company for such COBRA Continuation Coverage for up to the first 12 months you maintain such COBRA Continuation Coverage, above the amount of the applicable premium that you would have paid for comparable coverage during such 12 month period if you had remained an employee of the Company during such 12 month period.  Any reimbursements by the Company to you required under this Section 9.b shall be made on the last day of each month you pay the amount required by this Section 9.b to the Company for such COBRA Continuation Coverage, for up to the first 24 months of COBRA Continuation Coverage.  If you are a Specified Employee and the benefits specified in this Section 9.b are taxable to you and not otherwise exempt from Section 409A, the following provisions shall apply to the reimbursement or provision of such benefits.  Any amounts to which you would otherwise be entitled under this Section 9.b during the first six months following the date of your Separation from Service shall be accumulated and paid to you on the date that is six months following the date of your Separation from Service.  Except for any reimbursements under the applicable group health plan that are subject to a limitation on reimbursements during a specified period, the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement under this Section 9.b, or in-kind benefits provided, during your taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year of yours.  Any reimbursement of an expense described in this Section 9.b shall be made on or before the last day of your taxable year following your taxable year in which the expense was incurred.  Your right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits pursuant to this Section 9.b shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  Subject to your Group Medical Plan COBRA Coverage Continuation rights under section 4980B of the Code, the benefits listed in this Section 9.b shall be reduced to the extent benefits of the same type are received by you, your spouse or any eligible dependent from any other person during such period, and provided, further, that you shall have the obligation to notify the Company that you or they are receiving such benefits.

c.
