1.     
       GENERAL
    INFORMATION    

Icagen, Inc. (the  Company ,
 we ,  us ,  our ) is a Delaware corporation. The Company s principal office is in Research
Triangle Park, Durham, North Carolina. The Company was incorporated in November 2003. 

On July 15, 2016, Icagen-T, Inc. ( Icagen-T ),
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company consummated the transactions with Sanofi US Services Inc. ( Sanofi ) contemplated
by the Asset Purchase Agreement dated June 27, 2016 (the  Sanofi Asset Purchase Agreement ), pursuant to which Icagen-T
acquired certain assets of Sanofi that include the (i) Tucson Research Center, a two story laboratory and office building with
approximately 113,950 square feet of space located in the Town of Oro Valley, Pima County, Arizona (the  Tucson Facility ),
and the land on which the Facility is built; and (ii) certain machinery and equipment located at the Tucson Facility. The cash
purchase price under the Sanofi Asset Purchase Agreement was $1. Icagen-T assumed certain liabilities, agreed to continue the
employment of up to 46 employees at the Tucson Facility for at least two years and maintain the Sanofi chemical libraries that
remain at the Tucson Facility. 

Upon the closing of the
Sanofi Asset Purchase Agreement, on July 15, 2016, Icagen-T and Sanofi entered a Master Services Agreement (the
 MSA ). The MSA contains terms requiring that Icagen-T perform certain contract research for Sanofi, including,
but not limited to, compound testing services. Pursuant to the terms of the MSA, Sanofi will make payments (the
 Subsidy Payments ) to Icagen-T in consideration of Icagen-T s provision of services (including maintenance
of the chemical libraries) in the aggregate amount of $32 million over the next five years of which $14,000,000 was
designated as deferred subsidy revenue to support the operations and $18,000,000 was designated to cover services that
Icagen-T will provide to Sanofi, the proceeds are to be received as follows: (i) $16.5 million is expected to be paid in year
1 with $11.9 million paid at closing; (ii) $9.5 million is expected to be paid in year 2; (iii) $3 million is expected to be
paid in year 3; (iv) $2 million is expected to be paid in year 4; and (v) $1 million is expected to be paid in year 5. The
Subsidy Payments are to be credited against all direct service costs for which Icagen-T performs services, and in the event
the Subsidy Payments exceed the direct service costs, a maximum aggregate credit of $2 million will be carried forward to
subsequent years during the term of the MSA. During the current period, the Company recognized $2,000,0000 of the $14,000,000
designated as deferred  subsidy revenue to support operations, and a further $1,558,489 of the $18,000,000 designated to
cover services, as revenue. 

Upon the closing of the Sanofi Asset
Purchase Agreement, on July 15, 2016, Icagen-T executed a Deed of Trust providing Sanofi with a five year, $5 million lien on the
Tucson Facility, securing performance of Icagen-T s obligations under the MSA and the Sanofi Asset Purchase Agreement. The
lien is subject to termination upon the payment by Icagen-T of $5 million to Sanofi. The parties have also agreed to a Special
Warranty Deed with a Right of Reverter ( Deed of Sale ) that will revest in Sanofi all rights in the Tucson Facility
in the event that Icagen-T sells the Tucson Facility at any time within the next five years and upon certain other events related
to the leasing of space at the Tucson Facility. The reversion rights of Sanofi under the Deed of Sale will terminate after five
years as well as upon payment of the $5 million to extinguish the lien created by the Deed of Trust. 

The MSA contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that Icagen-T will be required to meet as well
as certain maintenance covenants. The affirmative covenants include: (i) maintenance of separate books and records from its affiliates;
(ii) maintenance of a separate board of directors from its affiliates; (iii) maintenance of its own bank accounts, invoices and
checks; (iv) that it conduct business in its own name; (v) that it pay liabilities from its own bank account; (vi) segregation
of its assets and liabilities from other entities; (vii) an allocation of any overhead expenses that are shared with affiliated
entities through intercompany agreements; and (viii) observing corporate formalities. The negative covenants, include a prohibition
on: (a) dividends other than up to a maximum of $2.0 million during the first two years of the term; (b) the guaranty of debts
of its affiliates; (c) the pledge of any of its assets for the benefit of any affiliate; (d) liens or borrowings unless done in
furtherance of the Tucson Facility; (e) acquisitions or sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business; and (f) amendments
to organizational documents. In accordance with the terms of the maintenance covenants Icagen-T will be required: (A) to maintain
a daily average cash balance held in all of its accounts for the prior five days of at least $575,000; (B) to maintain minimum
Current Ratio (as defined in the MSA) of 1.05; (C) to maintain a minimum net worth of $1.5 million and (D) not to run assays or
perform other contract research services, in each case, that Icagen-T or its affiliates could reasonably provide at the Tucson
Facility, at any site other than the Tucson Facility (the  Sanofi Exclusivity Provision ). Icagen-T will also be obligated
to fulfill certain reporting requirements specified in the MSA. At any time after the second anniversary of the effective date
of the MSA that Icagen-T provides an independent third party valuation certified by the National Association of Certified Evaluators
and Analysts that concludes that (x) Icagen-T s assets are greater than its liabilities at fair value (or fair market value);
(y) Icagen-T has sufficient capital to operate its business; and (z) Icagen-T has the ability to pay its debts as they mature,
then (1) all affirmative covenants and negative covenants shall terminate; (2) all reporting obligations shall terminate; and
(3) all future Subsidy Payments and the associated Payment credit mechanism will be converted into a take or pay arrangement.

       ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES AND ESTIMATES (continued)    

Estimates   

The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts and recovery of long-lived assets. We
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used
in the preparation of the financial statements. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the useful
life of plant and equipment and intangible assets, the valuation of certain assets and intangibles acquired from Icagen, and assumptions
used in assessing impairment of long-term assets and the assumptions used in determining percentage of completion on our long-term
contracts.  

Concentrations
of credit risk   

The
Company maintains cash with major financial institutions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) provides
insurance coverage for deposits of corporations, the current limit of coverage is $250,000. As a result of this coverage the Company
has cash balances of $8,575,714 that are not covered by the FDIC as of September 30, 2016.  

Concentration
of major customers   

The
Company derives its revenues from commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as from Government research contracts
and Government grants.  

Total revenues are as follows: 

Accounts
receivable and other receivables   

We
have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our
existing accounts receivable. As a basis for accurately estimating the likelihood of collection of our accounts receivable, we
consider a number of factors when determining reserves for uncollectable accounts. We believe that we use a reasonably reliable
methodology to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable. We review our allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular
basis. We also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions. If the financial
condition of our customers or other parties that we have business relations with were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment
of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.  

The balance of the receivables provision
as at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $0 and $19,084, respectively. The amount charged to bad debt provision for the
three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0 and $19,084, respectively, and for the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was $0.

2.     
       ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES AND ESTIMATES (continued)    

Revenue
recognition   

Revenue sources consist of commercial
contracts, deferred subsidy revenue and government grants and contracts. 

We enter into fixed fee commercial development
contracts that are not associated with the delivery of feasible research on drug candidates and the development of drug candidates.
Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized upon delivery or as the development is performed. 

We received and will receive
certain deferred subsidy revenue which is utilized to support our operations, maintain the facilities that we operate in and
continue the employment of certain employees to provide, if needed, resources to certain of our customers. This deferred
subsidy revenue is amortized over a straight-line basis to match the expected expenses to be incurred over the period
July 15, 2016 to December 31, 2017. 

We account for our long-term Firm Fixed
Price Government contracts and grants associated with the delivery of research on drug candidates and the development of drug candidates
using the percentage-of-completion accounting method. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress
towards completion of the long-term contract. 

We generally use the cost-to-cost measure
of progress for all our long-term contracts, unless we believe another measure will produce a more reliable result. We believe
that the cost-to-cost measure is the best and most reliable performance indicator of progress on our long-term contracts as all
our contract estimates are based on costs that we expect to incur in performing our long-term contracts and we have not experienced
any significant variations on estimated to actual costs to date. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress
towards completion is based on the ratio of costs incurred-to-date to the total estimated costs at the completion of the long-term
contract. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits are recorded as costs are incurred. 

When estimates of total costs to be
incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded
in the period the loss is determined. 

Research
and Development   

The
remuneration of the Company s research and development staff, materials used in internal research and development activities,
and payments made to third parties in connection with collaborative research and development arrangements, are all expensed as
incurred. Where the Company makes a payment to a third party to acquire the right to use a product formula which has received
regulatory approval, the payment is accounted for as the acquisition of a license or patent and is capitalized as an intangible
asset and amortized over the shorter of the license period or the patent life.  

The amount expensed for unrecovered
research costs, included in Selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months and nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $505,571 and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $72,912 and $250,855, respectively. 

Related
parties   

Parties
are considered to be related to the Company if the parties that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company,
its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with
which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other
to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company
discloses all related party transactions. All transactions are recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged. Property
purchased from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party
in excess of the cost is reflected as a distribution to the related party.  

Recent
                                         accounting pronouncements   

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement
of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  ASU 2016-13 will replace the current incurred loss approach with an expected loss
model for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities
rather than reduce the carrying amount under the current other-than-temporary impairment model. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-13
will have on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions
are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and

       ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES AND ESTIMATES (continued)    

In October 2016, Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. ( ASU ) 2016-16,  Intra-Entity Transfers
of Assets Other Than Inventory.  ASU 2016-16 requires immediate recognition of income tax consequences of intercompany asset
transfers, other than inventory transfers.  Existing GAAP prohibits recognition of income tax consequences of intercompany
asset transfers whereby the seller defers any net tax effect and the buyer is prohibited from recognizing a deferred tax asset
on the difference between the newly created tax basis of the asset in its tax jurisdiction and its financial statement carrying
amount as reported in the consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2016-16 specifically excludes from its scope intercompany
inventory transfers whereby the recognition of tax consequences will take place when the inventory is sold to third parties. ASU
2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued or
made available for issuance. We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-16 will have on our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.  

  Any
new accounting standards, not disclosed above, that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a
future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption.   

3.     
       GOING
    CONCERN    

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements,
the Company incurred a net loss of $(4,373,009) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $(8,676,037) for the year ended
December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had accumulated deficits of $26,515,834 and $22,142,825,
respectively. The Company s working capital decreased from $736,629 at December 31, 2015 to a deficit of $(4,280,086) as
of September 30, 2016. The Company s working capital is insufficient to meet its short-term cash requirements and fund any
future operating losses. These operating losses create an uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company s plan, through the acquisition of the assets of Icagen and Icagen-T and the continued promotion of
its services to existing and potential customers is to generate sufficient revenues to cover our anticipated expenses. The Company
is currently exploring several options to meet its short-term cash requirements, including an equity raise or loan funding from
third parties. Although no assurances can be given as to the Company s ability to deliver on its revenue plans, or that
unforeseen expenses may arise, the management of the Company believes that the revenue to be generated from operations together
with potential bridge note funding, additional issuances of equity or other potential financing will provide the necessary funding
for the Company to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company is economically dependent upon future
capital contributions or financing to fund ongoing operations.

In terms of US GAAP, the total purchase consideration was discounted back to present value at the Company s estimated weighted
average cost of capital of 6.7%, resulting in an estimated present value of future payments of $533,290. The discount of $36,722

securities purchase agreement entered into with each investor, 104.5 units at a per unit price of $10,000, each unit (the
 Units ) consisting of a note in the principal amount of $10,000 (the  Notes ) and a five-year
warrant (the  Warrants ) to acquire 1,500 shares of the Company s common stock, par value, $0.001 per
share, at an exercise price of $3.50 per share for gross proceeds of $1,045,000. On July 7, 2016, the Company sold an

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

The
following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results
of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and the notes presented herein and the financial statements and the other information set forth in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016.
In addition to historical information, the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly
from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic
reports filed and to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   

Overview
and Financial Condition    

We
partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to offer industry-leading scientific expertise and comprehensive access
to technologies for ion channel and transporter drug discovery and development. With over 20 years of leadership in the ion channel
field, our team has an extensive track record of success in advancing molecules from drug discovery to clinical development across
multiple therapeutic areas and ion channel classes. Through our recent asset acquisitions, we are now able to offer a full complement
of screening services to the broader pharmaceutical sector, including the use of proprietary x-ray fluorescence technology marketed
under the XRpro  trademark to deliver ion channel screening, ion channel kinetics and custom screening services to our customers.
Our capabilities include molecular biology and the use of complex functional assays, electrophysiology, bioanalytics and pharmacology.
We believe that this integrated set of capabilities enhances our ability to help our customers develop drug candidates and is
a commercial opportunity that meets a significant unmet medical need.  

We
utilize a target class approach to drug discovery. Whereas traditional drug discovery starts with a disease and seeks to identify
potential intervention points, or drug targets, our target class approach starts with all potential ion channel targets and seeks
to identify applications to the treatment of various diseases. We believe that our understanding of the ion channel genome and
ability to apply this knowledge in a target class approach to drug discovery facilitates our identification of small molecule
drug candidates with novel mechanisms of action and enhanced selectivity and specificity profiles. Moreover, because our drug
discovery and development process screens for potential side effects at an earlier stage than some alternative approaches, we
believe that this process enables us to identify small molecule drug candidates that may have a reduced risk of clinical failure
and may shorten clinical development timelines.  

Through our acquisition of the assets
of Pfizer, Inc. s subsidiary, Icagen, which was formed in 1992, we have an extensive platform of assay tools and technologies
for the interrogation of ion channel and transporter function and pharmacological modulation in addition to our proprietary label
free XRpro  technology. With our extensive experience in ion channels, screening, and drug development, which dates back to
1992 when Icagen was first founded, we have built an extensive portfolio of over 1,000 cell lines, including cell lines stably
expressing recombinant human ion channels and transporters, species orthologs and distinct disease-related or drug binding site
mutants. These tools form the basis for compound screening, selectivity assays, detailed assessment of activity, and mechanism
of action studies. 

Through
our recent acquisition of certain of the assets of Sanofi US Services Inc. ( Sanofi ), we now offer ultra high-throuput
biology, screening and chemical capabilities.  

We
also offer a full complement of assay technologies including high throughput fluorescence, manual and automated electrophysiology,
and radiotracer flux assays. Combined with our cell line and assay development expertise, these technologies enable us
to rapidly provide quality screening for a broad set of ion channels and transporters.  

Recent
Developments    

Financing   

Since
inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our securities, settlement of legal matters and
prior to our acquisition of certain assets of Icagen from Pfizer and the assets we acquired from Sanofi, substantially all of
our revenue was derived from government grants. Subsequent to our acquisition of certain assets of Icagen from Pfizer, a substantial
portion of our revenue has been derived from commercial customers. We expect to continue to seek to obtain our required capital
through the private sale of securities and revenue derived for the services we provide. Despite generating funds from commercial
customers and government grants, we continue to experience losses. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will
not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next twelve months. We will need to generate additional revenue from
operations and/or obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy, to respond to new competitive pressures or to take
advantage of opportunities that may arise. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to this uncertainty. To meet our financing needs,
we are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, debt financings and/or
funding from partnerships or collaborations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transactions
on acceptable terms or otherwise.  

As a result of the agreement that we
entered into with the subsidiary of Pfizer, we agreed; (i) to continue to retain certain employees of the subsidiary until June
30, 2017, which we estimate will require additional compensation of $2,015,433; (ii) to make additional payments in terms of the
Asset Purchase and Collaboration Agreement that we entered into on June 26, 2015 with a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., which was amended
on July 15, 2016 (the  Pfizer APA ) which additional payments include (a) a cash payment of $500,000 on the second
anniversary of the closing provided that prior to such date the service agreement we entered into has generated at least $4,000,000
in revenue; and (b) beginning in May 2017, a quarterly earn out payment (the  Earn Out Payment ) of the greater of (i)
$250,000 per quarter or (ii)10% of revenue earned during the quarter up to a maximum aggregate payment of $10,000,000, and (iii)
to make minimum lease payments in terms of a sub-lease agreement entered into with Pfizer for the period April 1, 2016 to April
30, 2019 with annual escalations of 3.5%, estimated to be $468,000. 

As a result of the agreement we entered
into with Sanofi, we agreed to (i) to continue to retain certain employees of the Tucson Research Center located in the Town of
Oro Valley, Pima County, Arizona (the  Tucson Facility ) for two years, which we estimate will require additional compensation
of $15,514,800; (ii) to maintain the Sanofi chemical library that remains at the Facility. 

We have also entered into Master Services
Agreements ( MSA ) with various pharmaceutical companies where we have agreed to perform certain services for them. 

The total value of unbilled Purchase
orders received from commercial customers as of September 30, 2016 amounted to approximately $1,264,000. 

Discussions with respect to our operations included herein include the operations of our operating subsidiary,
Icagen Corp. and Icagen-T, Inc. We formed Icagen-T, Inc. on June 16, 2016. We formed Icagen Corp. on July 9, 2010. We have another
two subsidiary companies, Caldera Discovery Inc. and XRpro Sciences Inc., which have always been dormant. 

Results
of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015.   

Revenues    

We had revenues totaling $4,308,100 and
$465,214 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $3,842,886 or 826.0%. Revenue
includes commercial revenue of $2,181,329 (representing 50.6% of our revenue); deferred subsidy revenue of $2,000,000
(representing 46.4% of our revenue) and Government revenue of $126,771 (representing 3.0% of our revenue). In the prior year,
commercial revenues generated from our North Carolina site were $406,250 (representing 87.3% of our revenue) and Government
revenue were $58,964 (representing 12.7% of our revenue). The increase in revenue over the prior is primarily attributable to
the following; i) work performed for Sanofi under the MSA agreement that we entered into with them upon the acquisition of
certain assets and personnel at the Tucson Facility, amounting to $1,558,489; ii) deferred subsidy revenue from Sanofi of
$2,000,000 recognized during the current period to support our operations and maintain the facility and employees and iii)
commercial revenue generated from our North Carolina site increased by $216,590 over the prior year, or by 53.3% as we
increased our customer base over the prior period. Commercial revenue includes revenue from twenty three customers, including
four large pharma customers. The Government contract revenue is derived from two government contracts which are ongoing. At
September 30, 2016, we had an order backlog of approximately $1,264,000 on commercial contracts and $380,000 in the form of
firm fixed price government contracts. We believe that these are firm orders as there are no indications that funding will
not be available and we believe that we have made satisfactory progress on the government projects to date. The funds
available under these grants are earned by us on a percentage-of-completion basis, based on the costs we incur as a measure
of the progress made on the project. 

We continue to market our services
to several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We believe that we now have a comprehensive product offering and substantial
credibility to offer a full range of products including the advantages and value propositions of the XRpro  technology. While
we are optimistic about our prospects, there can be no assurance about whether or when our products will generate sufficient revenues
with adequate margins in order for us to be profitable. 

Cost
of goods sold    

Cost of goods sold totaled $2,324,586
and $734,759 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $1,589,827 or 216.4%. Cost of
goods sold is primarily comprised of direct expenses related to providing our services to our customers. These expenses include
scientific personnel expenses, recoverable expenses incurred on contracts, the cost of outside consultants, and direct materials
used on our contracts. Our cost of goods sold includes the payroll cost of an additional 26 scientists located at our recently
acquired Tucson Facility who are primarily engaged in providing services to Sanofi. The payroll expense included in cost of sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively was $1,600,399 and $562,379, an increase of $1,038,020 or
184.6%. This is primarily due to the number of scientists performing work for our commercial customers and government contracts
increasing from a headcount of 17 to 43 after the acquisition of the Tucson Facility from Sanofi. For additional information regarding
salary expense reference is made to the discussion of total salary expense in selling, general and administrative expenses below.
Included in cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively was laboratory supplies and direct
materials of $461,110 and $159,775, an increase of $301,335 or 188.6%, the increase is primarily due to the level of activity
generated by our recent acquisition of certain of the assets of the Tucson Facility and the commercial revenue contracts that
we have in place. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, outside contractors  costs amounted
to $261,598 and $3,620, the increase of $257,978 or 7,126.5% the increase is primarily due to, i) third party laboratory equipment
maintenance contracts for the Tucson Facility and ii) costs of 5 outside laboratory personnel at the Tucson Facility and 1laboratory
person in North Carolina who perform laboratory services for us on an ongoing basis. 

Gross profit (loss)   

Gross profit was $1,983,514
and gross loss was $(269,545) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase in gross
profit of $2,253,059 or 835.9%. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the  commercial revenue and deferred
subsidy revenue generated by the Tucson facility. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses    

Selling, general and administrative
expenses totaled $2,862,719 and $1,625,579 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of
$1,237,140 or 76.1%.  

The
major expenses making up selling, general and administrative expenses included the following:  

The
decrease in marketing expenditure over the prior period is primarily due to costs incurred on improving and developing the website
in the prior period, offset by increased marketing activity in the current year to improve our commercial presence.  

Total
payroll expenses are allocated to the various expense categories detailed below.  

Total
salary expenditure for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively was included in the following expense
categories:  

The increase in total payroll expenditure
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,858,270 is primarily due to the acquisition of the assets and employees of
the Tucson Facility on July 15, 2016. An additional 46 employees were acquired in terms of the acquisition agreement, the employment
of a VP of Business Development on March 1, 2016 and the employment of a chief business development officer, offset by the savings
generated from 5 employees who were severed in the prior year upon the closure of the Los Alamos and Cambridge laboratories.   

The total payroll expense included in
cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $1,038,020, primarily due to the additional 26 laboratory
employees at our Tucson facility included in cost of sales. 

The payroll expense charged to Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $387,591, This increase is primarily
due to the acquisition of the additional 7 administrative employees with the Tucson Facility and the employment of a VP of business
development on March 1, 2016 and a Chief Business Development Officer on August 22, 2016. 

The payroll expense charged to research
and development increased by $432,569 primarily due to an average of 13 employees working on internal research projects at our
Tucson facility.  

The stock option compensation charge
increased by $41,134. The charge for each period is dependent upon the number of options issued, any new options issued, the value
of the options and the vesting schedule of these options. During the current quarter, options were issued to certain key members
of management in our recently acquired Tucson Facility, resulting in an increased stock option compensation for the quarter. 

Legal fees increased by $71,157, over
the prior period. The increase consists primarily of an increase in legal expenses primarily associated with the acquisition of
the Sanofi assets, which was consummated in July, an increase in patent legal fees to improve our patent protection and ensure
all matters are up-to-date, offset by decreases in expenditure on the Bellows matter, which has been settled, and, the Eisenschenk
matter due to lower legal activity during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The decrease in consulting fees of $43,366
is primarily due to the termination of investor relations and patent consultants whose services have been outsourced to professional
businesses at reduced costs. 

The decrease in professional fees of
$127,524 was primarily due to professional advisors utilized in assessing the acquisition of the Icagen assets, in the prior period.
The assessment of the acquisition of the Sanofi assets in the current period was primarily performed by management. 

Facilities maintenance expenditure related
to buildings and building maintenance has been reclassified in the current period to facilities expense, which includes rental
expenses, utilities expense and all other facility operating costs. The prior period amount included a monthly charge of approximately
$12,000 per month incurred for general facilities maintenance for the three months ended September 2015. 

Facilities expense increased by $379,772
over the prior period, primarily due to the following movements; i) an increase in cleaning and janitorial expenses of $92,999
incurred primarily at our newly acquired Tucson Facility; ii) an increase in facilities repairs and maintenance expenditure of
$75,105, primarily due to repairs and maintenance contracts at our newly acquired Tucson Facility; iii) Security services expenditure
at our Tucson Facility of $83,527; iv) an increase in utilities expenditure of $199,475 consisting primarily of electricity charges
in Tucson to maintain the approximately113,000 square foot Tucson Facility; offset by a rental decrease of $78,040 over the prior
year due to the closure of the Los Alamos and Cambridge sites and non-renewal of corporate apartment leases;. 

Travel expenditure increased by $32,710
due to increased travel incurred from the acquisition of the Tucson Facility, several conferences and seminars being attended by
scientific personnel and the increased travel by our business development personnel to increase our presence and visibility in
front of customers. 

Depreciation and Amortization   

We recognized depreciation expenses
of $136,874 and $89,392 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, an increase of $47,502 or 53.2%, the
increase is due to the amortization of annual software licenses acquired at the Tucson Facility, additional software acquired for
the North Carolina site and the acquisition of laboratory equipment in the prior quarter. The depreciation expense is primarily
made up of depreciation of our laboratory equipment, which makes up the vast majority of our capital equipment. 

Amortization expense was $56,246 and
$124,358 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The decrease in amortization expense is directly related to the
acquisition of the Icagen assets and the value placed on the Discovery platform and the Assembled Workforce acquired, the value
of these assets were adjusted during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and the amortization charge was re-estimated in that quarter. 

Other Expense   

Other expense totaled $601,500 and $1,465,025
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $863,525 or 58.9%. Other expense in the current
period of $601,500 represents additional legal settlement accruals which we anticipate we will pay to settle the Estate of Sigmund
Eisenschenk matter. In the prior period, other expense represented the additional expense required to settle the Bellows matter
and a severance accrual on the closure of the Los Alamos and Cambridge sites. 

Interest expense   

Interest expense totaled $407,354 and
$2,409 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The interest expense in the current period included
a Note discount of $244,463 relating to the issuance of Warrants with the Offering and the amortization of interest incurred on
the Pfizer loan and certain asset acquisitions of $153,085. Interest of $9,634 was also incurred on the Notes. 

Net loss   

Net loss totaled $2,082,046 and $3,593,747
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net loss is primarily due the acquisition
of the Tucson facility. 

Results
of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

Revenues    

We
had revenues totaling $6,366,424 and $591,025 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an
increase of $5,775,399 or 977.2%. Current period revenue includes commercial revenue of $3,973,385 (representing 62.4% of our
revenue); deferred subsidy revenue of $2,000,000 (representing 31.4% of our revenue) and Government revenue of $393,039
(representing 6.2% of our revenue) In the prior year, commercial revenues generated from our North Carolina site were
$406,250 (representing 68.7% of our revenue) and Government revenue were $184,775 (representing 31.3% of our revenue). The
increase in revenue over the prior is primarily attributable to the following; i) work performed for Sanofi under the MSA
agreement that we entered into with them upon the acquisition of certain assets and personnel at the Tucson Facility,
amounting to $1,558,489; ii) deferred subsidy revenue from Sanofi of $2,000,000 recognized during the current period
to support our operations and maintain the facility and employees and iii) commercial revenue generated from our North
Carolina site increased by $216,590 over the prior year, or by 53.3% as we increased our customer base over the prior
period. Commercial revenue includes revenue from twenty three customers, including four large pharma customers. The
Government contract revenue is derived from two government contracts which are ongoing. At September 30, 2016, we had an
order backlog of approximately $1,264,000 on commercial contracts and $380,000 in the form of firm fixed price government
contracts. We believe that these are firm orders as there are no indications that funding will not be available and we
believe that we have made satisfactory progress on the government projects to date. The funds available under these grants
are earned by us on a percentage-of-completion basis, based on the costs we incur as a measure of the progress made on the
project.  

We continue to market our services to several pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies. We believe that we now have a comprehensive product offering and substantial credibility to offer a full
range of products including the advantages and value propositions of the XRpro  technology. While we are optimistic about
our prospects, there can be no assurance about whether or when our products will generate sufficient revenues with adequate margins
in order for us to be profitable. 

Cost
of goods sold    

Cost of goods sold totaled $3,860,431 and $1,026,626
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $2,833,805 or 276.0%. Cost of goods sold is
primarily comprised of direct expenses related to providing our services to our customers. These expenses include scientific personnel
expenses, recoverable expenses incurred on contracts, the cost of outside consultants, and direct materials used on our contracts.
The salary expense included in cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively was $2,787,094
and $653,797, an increase of $2,133,297 or 326.3%. This is primarily due to the number of scientists performing work for our commercial
customers and government contracts increasing from a headcount of 15 to 41. For additional information regarding salary expense
reference is made to the discussion of total salary expense in selling, general and administrative expenses below. Included in
cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively was laboratory supplies and direct materials
of $762,731 and $304,547, an increase of $458,184 or 150.4%, the increase is primarily due to the level of activity generated by
our recent acquisition of certain of the assets of the Tucson Facility and the commercial revenue contracts that we have in place.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, outside contractors  costs amounted to $320,372 and
$56,960, the increase of $263,412 or 462.5% is due to, i) third party laboratory equipment maintenance contracts for the Tucson
Facility and ii) costs of 5 outside laboratory personnel at the Tucson Facility and 1laboratory person in North Carolina who perform
laboratory services for us on an ongoing basis. 

Gross
profit (loss)    

Gross profit was $2,505,993
and gross loss was $(435,601) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase in
profitability of $2,941,594 or 675.3%. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the  commercial revenue and deferred
subsidy revenue generated by the Tucson facility. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses    

Selling, general and administrative expenses
totaled $5,052,957 and $4,036,924 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $1,016,033
or 25.2%. 

The
major expenses making up selling, general and administrative expenses included the following:  

The
decrease in marketing expenditure over the prior period is primarily due to costs incurred on improving and developing the website
in the previous period, this was a once off expenditure, marketing expenditure is expected to increase as we intensify our efforts
to commercialize our services.  

Total
salary expenses are allocated to the various expense categories detailed below depending on the level of activity of our employees
on commercial and government contracts, internal research and development expenses and administrative activities. An increase
in activity on projects will result in an increase in salary expense charged to cost of sales with a corresponding decrease in
salary expense charged to selling, general and administrative expenses. A comparison of salary expenses is presented below.  

Total
payroll expenses are allocated to the various expense categories detailed below.  

Total salary expenditure for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively was included in the following expense categories: 

The increase in total salary expenditure
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $2,987,950 is primarily due to the acquisition of the assets and employees of
the Tucson Facility on July 15, 2016. An additional 46 employees and the inclusion of an additional 19 employees from the acquisition
of the Icagen site in July 2015, in terms of the acquisition agreements related to these sites, the employment of a VP of Business
Development on March 1, 2016 and the employment of a chief business development officer, offset by the savings generated from
5 employees who were severed in the prior year upon the closure of the Los Alamos and Cambridge laboratories. 

The total payroll expense included in cost of
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $2,133,297, primarily due to the additional 26 laboratory employees
at our Tucson facility included in cost of sales. 

The payroll expense charged to Selling, general
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $599,937. This increase is primarily due
to the acquisition of the additional 7 administrative employees with the Tucson Facility and an additional 3 employees at the North
Carolina site in July 2015, the employment of a VP of business development on March 1, 2016 and a Chief Business Development Officer
on August 22, 2016. 

The payroll expense charged to research and
development increased by $254,716 primarily due to an average of 13 employees working on internal research projects at our Tucson
facility. 

The stock option compensation charge decreased
by $23,442. The charge for each period is dependent upon the number of options issued, any new options issued, the value of the
options and the vesting schedule of these options, during the current quarter, options were issued to certain key members of management
in our recently acquired Tucson Facility. Several options became fully vested in the prior period which resulted in a lower stock
option compensation charge for the current period. 

Legal fees increased by $1,078 over the prior
period. The slight increase is made up of a net reduction in litigation related legal expenditure of $160,051, offset by an increase
in general corporate expenditure primarily related to the acquisition of the Tucson Facility of $91,691 and additional legal fees
spent on patents amounting to $51,881. 

The decrease in consulting fees of $252,109
is primarily due to the termination of investor relations and patent consultants whose services have been outsourced to professional
businesses at reduced costs. 

The decrease in professional fees of
$131,831 was primarily due to professional advisors utilized in assessing the acquisition of the Icagen assets, in the prior period.
The assessment of the acquisition of the Sanofi assets in the current period was primarily performed by management. 

Facilities maintenance expenditure related to
buildings and building maintenance has been reclassified in the current period to facilities expense, which includes rental expenses,
utilities expense and all other Facility operating costs. The prior period amount included a monthly charge of approximately $12,000
per month incurred for general facilities maintenance for the three months ended September 2015. 

Facilities expense increased by $428,418 over
the prior period, primarily due to the following movements; i) an increase in cleaning and janitorial expenses of $92,999 incurred
primarily at our newly acquired Tucson Facility; ii) an increase in facilities repairs and maintenance expenditure of $182,083,
primarily due to repairs and maintenance contracts at our newly acquired Tucson Facility; iii) Security services expenditure at
our Tucson Facility of $83,527; iv) an increase in utilities expenditure of $211,218 consisting primarily of electricity charges
in Tucson to maintain the approximately113,000 square foot Facility, offset by a decrease in rental expense of $148,115 over the
prior period due to the closure of the Los Alamos and Cambridge sites and cancellation of corporate apartment leases; 

Travel expenditure increased by $61,669 due
to increased travel incurred on the acquisition of the Tucson Facility, several conferences and seminars being attended by scientific
personnel and the increased travel by our business development personnel to increase our presence and visibility in front of customers. 

Depreciation
and Amortization    

We recognized depreciation expenses of $350,755
and $154,441 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, an increase of $196,314 or 127.1%, the increase
is due to the amortization of annual software licenses acquired at the Tucson Facility, additional software acquired for the North
Carolina site and the acquisition of laboratory equipment in the prior period for the North Carolina site. The depreciation expense
is primarily made up of depreciation of our laboratory equipment, which makes up the vast majority of our capital equipment. 

Amortization
expense was $168,738 and $150,200 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The increase in amortization expense
is directly related to the acquisition of the Icagen assets and the value placed on the Discovery platform and the Assembled Workforce
acquired, the value of these assets were adjusted during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and the amortization charge was re-estimated
in that quarter.  

Other
Expense    

Other expense totaled $601,500 and $1,550,025
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $948,025 or 61.2%. Other expense in the current
period of $601,500 represents additional legal settlement accruals which we anticipate we will pay to settle the Estate of Sigmund
Eisenschenk matter. In the prior period, other expense represented the additional expense required to settle the Bellows matter
and a severance accrual on the closure of the Los Alamos and Cambridge sites. 

Interest
expense    

Interest expense totaled $704,520 and $6,615
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The interest expense in the current period included a Note
discount of $244,463 relating to the issuance of Warrants with the Offering and the amortization of interest incurred on the Pfizer
loan and certain asset acquisitions of $448,071 Interest of $11,081 was also incurred on the Notes. 

Net
loss    

Net loss totaled $4,373,009 and $6,347,829 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net loss is primarily due the acquisition of the
Tucson facility. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We have a history of annual losses from operations
since inception and we have primarily funded our operations through sales of our unregistered equity securities and cash flows
generated from government contracts and grants and more recently from commercial customers and the settlement of a lawsuit. We
are generating funds from commercial customers and government grants, however, we continue to experience losses and will need to
raise additional funds to meet our working capital requirements, despite the outcome of settlement discussions we are having in
our lawsuits could have a significant impact on our financial position. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents
will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next twelve months. Despite the $32 million we expect to derive
from Icagen-T for services provided to and operating expense contributions paid by Sanofi over the next five years and the revenue
we expect to receive from Pfizer, we anticipate that our expenses will exceed such revenue. We will need to generate additional
revenue from operations and/or obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy, to respond to new competitive pressures
or to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to this uncertainty. To
meet our financing needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings,
debt financings and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete
any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise. 

In June and July 2016, we raised gross proceeds
of $1,145,000 from the sale of Notes in the Offering. These Notes were repaid in August 2016. 

On July 15, 2016, we consummated the acquisition
of certain of the assets from Sanofi, including the Tucson Facility. This resulted in a cash infusion of $11.9 million, which funds
will primarily be used to fund the Tucson Facility operations. 

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash totaling $9,079,941, other current assets totaling $1,640,228 and total assets of
$20,509,079. We had total current liabilities of $15,000,275 and a net working capital deficit of $4,280,086. Total
liabilities were $22,745,080, including deferred purchase consideration of $8,745,625, Prepaid revenue of $1,191,512 and
deferred subsidy revenue of $8,000,000, all of which were received from Sanofi. The deferred purchase consideration
includes a net present value discount of $1,898,420 (made up of a gross present value discount of $2,468,700 less imputed
interest expense of $714,325), the gross amount still due in terms of the acquisition agreement is $10,500,000 of which
$500,000 is dependent on the achievement of a revenue target with Pfizer and $10,000,000 is due based on a potential earn out
charge of the greater of (i)10% of gross revenues commencing in January 2017 per quarter and (ii) $250,000 per quarter, up to
a maximum of $10,000,000. Our stockholders  deficit amounted to $2,236,802. 

Should we not achieve our forecasted operating
results or should strategic opportunities present themselves such that additional financial resources would present attractive
investing opportunities for us, we may decide in the future to issue debt or sell our equity securities in order to raise additional
cash. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether we will be able to secure any additional financing, or the terms of any such
financing transaction if one were to occur. 

The
Los Alamos county loan was repaid on June 30, 2016.  

An
analysis of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 is provided below:  

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
was $7,589,868 and $(3,909,243) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash provided
by (used in) operating activities was primarily due to the following: 

The
decrease in net loss is discussed under net loss in the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.  

The change in adjustments for non-cash items
amounting to $(122,716) is primarily due to; i) the decrease in the legal settlement accrual of $(843,048); offset by ii) the
$448,071 imputed interest charge on the Sanofi deferred purchase price payment; and iii) the amortization of the debt discount
on the Notes amounting to $244,463. 

The change in operating assets and
liabilities of $9,647,007 consisted of i) the cash infusion by Sanofi of $10,000,000 of which $2,0000,000 of the deferred
subsidy revenue was amortized during the current period, to cover operating expenditure for a period of 18 months from July 2016;
ii) the deferred revenue payment made by Sanofi, totaling $2,750,001 offset by the revenue recognized to date of $1,558,489;
iii) the movement in accounts receivable of $482,910 and the movement in accounts payable of $356,402, primarily due to the
acquisition of Sanofi during the current period. 

Net cash used in investing activities
was $1,090,346 and $562,274, the current period amount included; deferred purchase price payments to Pfizer of $125,000 and the
acquisition of a critical piece of equipment under a lease for $533,290 and software purchases related to our scientific platforms,
we also funded utility deposits amounting to $123,787 related to the acquisition of the Tucson Facility. The prior period consisted
of deferred purchase price payments to Pfizer of $250,000 and primarily software purchases relating to our scientific platforms. 

Net cash provided by financing activities
was $313,631 and $3,474,037 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash provided by financing
activities during the current period was primarily due to the proceeds received and repayment of the notes of $1,145,000, netting
to $0; the repayment of the Los Alamos county loan amounting to $142,502, and the lease funding on the equipment acquired of $533,290,
of which $57,502 was repaid during the current period. The cash provided by financing activities in the prior year is primarily
due to the net proceeds raised on the second closing of the recently concluded private placement of $3,521,592, after deducting
share issue expenses of $314,541; and the payment of a dividend of $48,300 to the Series A stockholder. 

Capital Expenditures  

Our current plan is to purchase equipment and
software to ensure that our recent acquisition of the Tucson Facility and Icagen functions efficiently and that we are able to
support the commercialization efforts of the Company. We anticipate that we would need to spend an additional $1,300,000 on software
licensing over the next six months. 

Commitments  

In terms of the asset purchase agreement entered
into on July 1, 2015, with Icagen, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. we are required to make additional purchase price
payments of $500,000 on July 1, 2017, provided certain milestones are met by Pfizer. 

We are also obligated to make earn out payments
equals to the greater of 10% of total Group revenues per quarter and $250,000 per quarter, up to a maximum of $10,000,000, commencing
on revenues generated from January 1, 2017, which payments are to be made 6o days after each quarter end. 

We are required to make monthly lease payments
of $28,751 with a balloon payment of $225,000 at the end of the lease term on equipment leased for the laboratory. 

We sub-let premises from Pfizer located at Research
Triangle Park, Durham, North Carolina. The lease terminates on April 30, 2019. 

Future annual minimum payments required under
operating lease obligations as of September 30, 2016, are as follows: 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

Please

Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements nor do we participate in non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting
treatment.  

Inflation   

The
effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

The
Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected,
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s
management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,
the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that due to a lack of segregation of duties the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company
files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Subject to
receipt of additional financing or revenue generated from operations, the Company intends to retain additional individuals to
remedy the ineffective controls.  

Changes
in Internal Control   

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

Set
forth below is a factual description of the status of Company's legal proceedings. It should not be misconstrued as the Company's
acquiescence in any claimant's position with respect to such litigation. The Company continues to believe that the claims made
against it do not have any merit whatsoever and intends to vigorously defend itself.  

There have been no material litigation
developments since the filing of our Annual Report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our quarterly reports
on forms 10-Q for the three months and  nine months ended September 30, 2016, other than as follows: 

Litigation with Estate of Sigmund
Eisenschenk  

On August 15, 2016, the Company filed
its reply brief in the Illinois Appellate Court in connection with the appeal from the sanctions orders of March 16, 2015 and May
26, 2015. The appeal from the March 16, 2015 and May 26, 2015, orders is fully briefed and the parties are now awaiting a decision. 

On August 22, 2016, the Court denied
the Company s motion to stay American Milling and the Estate s motion for partial summary judgment as to Count VI of
the Second Amended Petition for Citation to Recover. The court also denied the Company s motion to dismiss Count IV of the
Second Amended Petition for Citation to Recover. 

On September 20, 2016, the Company
filed an interlocutory appeal from the order of August 22, 2016, denying the Company s motion to stay the Estate s
motion for partial summary judgment as to Count VI of the Second Amended Petition for Citation to Recover. 

On September 28, 2016, Icagen and American
Milling entered into an Assignment and Mutual Release Agreement whereby Icagen agreed to pay American Milling the sum of eight
hundred thousand dollars ($800,000.00) in exchange for an assignment by American Milling of all of American Millings first class
claims, fifth class claims, sanctions awards, right title, claim and interest in any portion of the Appeal Bond filed by Icagen
in the Illinois Appellate Court, all past, present and future sanctions awards, all past, present and future claims and all past,
present and future claims for attorneys  fees, costs and expenses.

an order granting partial summary judgment as to Count VI of the Second Amended Petition for Citation to Recover in favor of the
Estate and against the Company in the amount of $1,137,500. 

On October 7, 2016, QTM Ventures filed
an emergency motion to enforce an alleged settlement agreement between QTM Ventures and American Milling. In their emergency motion,
QTM alleges, amongst other things, that QTM agreed to cease to pursue an appeal and a motion for reclassification of its claim
in exchange for an agreement with American Milling to split the proceeds of the Estate. QTM further argues that, by virtue of its
Settlement Agreement with American Milling, QTM is entitled to 50% of the payments made/to be made to American Milling by Icagen
under the American-Milling Icagen Assignment and Release Agreement. 

On October 11, 2016, the Company filed a notice
of appeal in the Circuit Court from the Court order granting partial summary judgment as to Count VI of the Second Amended Petition
for Citation to Recover. 

On November 1, 2016, the Illinois Appellate
Court scheduled oral arguments in the Company s appeal from the sanctions orders of March 16, 2015 and May 26, 2015. Oral
arguments are scheduled for December 1, 2016. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors.   

The
following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A,
 Risk Factors,  contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which
was filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Risks
Related to the Company   

We
have a history of losses and there can be no assurance that we will generate or sustain positive earnings.    

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we had a net loss of $(4,373,009), for the year ended December 31, 2015 we had a net loss of $(8,676,037), and for the year ended
December 31, 2014, we had an income of $49,517, primarily due to the favorable settlement of the LANS matter in the prior year.
We cannot be certain that our business strategy will ever be successful and do not have enough information regarding our new business
model which now concentrates on commercial customers to assess its success. Future revenues and profits, if any, will depend upon
various factors, including the success, if any, of our expansion plans for the lease of our instruments and services to biotechnical
and pharmaceutical customers, marketability of our instruments and services, our ability to maintain favorable relations with manufacturers
and customers, and general economic conditions. There is no assurance that we can operate profitably or that we will successfully
implement our plans. There can be no assurance that we will ever generate positive earnings.  

A significant portion of our net revenue
has been generated from services provided to two customers.    

The termination of our relationship with Pfizer
and Sanofi would adversely affect our business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we derived 93.8% of our revenue from
commercial contracts (of which 16.5% of our revenue was for services provided to Pfizer and 59.6% was for services provided to
Sanofi), the remaining 6.2% was derived from Government contracts; and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived 84% of our
revenues from commercial contracts of which 75.8% of our revenue were for services provided to Pfizer, the remaining 16.3% was
derived from Government contracts. Prior to the acquisition of certain of the assets of Icagen we derived substantially all of
our revenue from services we performed for two governmental agencies. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 84% of our revenue
has been generated from government contracts and the remaining 16% generated from commercial contracts. Our business model which
now concentrates on commercial customers is relatively new and there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the revenue
derived from commercial customers to a significant amount. As of the date hereof we have three existing contracts with the National
Institutes of Health ( NIH ) pursuant to which we are continuing to perform services. Our Sanofi MSA provides that
Sanofi will make payments to Icagen-T of $32 million over the next five years in consideration of Icagen-T providing services to
Sanofi, so long as Icagen-T complies with the covenants set forth in the Sanofi MSA. Our MSA with Pfizer which terminates in July
2017 guarantees $1,000,000 of revenue to us per each twelve-month period until June 30, 2017. There can be no assurance that we
will attract a sufficient number of other pharmaceutical companies to provide our services to or that our Pfizer will increase
the scope of the services required. We do not have enough information regarding our new business model to assess its success. 

It is anticipated that a significant portion
of our net revenue will be generated from services to be provided to Sanofi.   

The termination of our relationship with Sanofi
would adversely affect our business. Our Sanofi MSA provides that Sanofi will make payments to Icagen-T of $32 million over the
next five in consideration of Icagen-T providing services to Sanofi, so long as Icagen-T complies with the covenants set forth
in the Sanofi MSA. Inasmuch as prior to the acquisition of the Tucson Facility, the Tucson Facility was used solely to service
Sanofi and had no third party customers, we anticipate that initially, Sanofi will be Icagen-T s only customer at the Tucson
Facility. We cannot guarantee when, or if ever, our dependence upon Sanofi as a major customer at the Tucson Facility will end.
There can be no assurance that we will attract a sufficient number of other pharmaceutical companies to provide our services to
or that Sanofi will increase the scope of the services required. We do not have enough information regarding our new business model
to assess its success. 

Our business is dependent upon our ability
to attract new commercial customers.    

Our future success is dependent upon us attracting
new commercial customers and increasing the services that we provide to existing customers, including Sanofi and Pfizer. The $1,000,000
guaranteed payment that we are to receive from Pfizer under the Pfizer MSA terminates on June 30, 2017. The payments that we are
to receive from Sanofi under the terms of the Sanofi MSA are subject to termination in the event that we do not comply with certain
covenants contained in the Sanofi MSA that are unrelated to our performance of services under the Sanofi MSA. In addition, the
guaranteed payments from Sanofi in years three through five of the Sanofi MSA are significantly less than those to be paid in years
one and two and will not be sufficient to cover the costs of the operations at the Tucson Facility. We do not have enough information
regarding our new business model which concentrates on commercial customers to assess its success. Our future success is dependent
upon us attracting new customers and increasing the services that we provide to existing customers, including Sanofi and Pfizer.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract new commercial customers or increase the services that we provide to
existing customers, including Pfizer and Sanofi. 

If
we cannot establish profitable operations, we will need to raise additional capital to fully implement our business plan, which
may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and which may dilute your investment.    

We incurred a net loss of $(4,373,009) for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and a net loss of $(8,676,037) for the year ended December 31, 2015 and generated a net income
of $49,517 for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the favorable settlement of the LANS matter in the prior year.
Achieving and sustaining profitability will require us to increase our revenues and manage our product, operating and administrative
expenses. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in achieving profitability. Pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer APA, as
amended July 15, 2016, we are required to pay Pfizer an additional $500,000 on July 1, 2017 and commencing May 2017, minimum quarterly
payments of $250,000 each quarter up to a maximum of $10,000,000. In addition, we agreed to retain eighteen employees of Icagen,
Inc. at an estimated remaining cost of $2,325,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Sanofi APA, Icagen-T agreed to retain 46 employees
at an estimated cost to Icagen-T of $8,400,000 per annum for at least two years and to maintain and pay the maintenance costs of
the Sanofi chemical libraries that remain at the Tucson Facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to pay our expenses
and our existing sources of cash and cash flows are otherwise insufficient to fund our activities, we will need to raise additional
funds to continue our operations at their current level and in order to fully implement our business plan. We do not have any commitments
in place for additional funds. If needed, additional funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. As of the date hereof,
we expect that our current cash and revenues generated from services, our private placement financings and the settlement of the
LANS litigation will provide us with enough funds to continue our operations at our current level for at least 10 months. Unless
we raise additional funds or increase revenues we will be forced to curtail our operations and limit our marketing expenditures.
Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution,
and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders.
If we are unsuccessful in achieving profitability and we cannot obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms or at
all, we may be required to curtail significantly or cease our operations significantly, it could result in the loss of all of your
investment in our stock.  

We
may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet the minimum payments required under our agreements and will need to raise
additional capital to meet our working capital needs,    

In accordance with the terms of the Pfizer APA
that we entered into on June 26, 2015 with a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. and which was amended on July 15, 2016, beginning in May
2017, we agreed to pay a quarterly earn out payment (the  Earn Out Payment ) equal to the greater of (i) 10% of revenue
earned during the quarter or (ii) $250,000 up to a maximum aggregate payment of $10,000,000. We also agreed to continue the employment
of several prior individuals of the subsidiary for at least two years, which we estimate will require an additional $2,325,000
in future compensation. Additionally, in accordance with the terms of the Sanofi MSA we agreed to continue the employment of 46
prior individuals Sanofi for at least two years, which we estimate will require an additional $8,400,000 in future compensation
and we agreed to maintain and pay for the maintenance of the Sanofi chemical libraries that remain at the Tucson Facility. To date,
we have not generated sufficient revenue to pay all of these commitments. If we do not increase our revenue, we may be required
to raise additional capital to meet our obligations which could result in dilution to stockholders. 

We
have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in material adverse outcomes.    

On
April 22, 2014, Dentons  US LLP (Dentons) filed a complaint against us seeking to confess a judgment in the amount of $3,050,000.00
based upon a settlement agreement we entered into with Dentons, dated July 5, 2013.   We recently were informed that
on May 7, 2014, Dentons confessed a judgment against us in an ex-parte proceeding for $3,050,000.00 and the costs of the suit,
which amount bears interest until paid at nine percent (9%) per annum. If the confession of judgment were to be enforced against
us by Dentons it could result, among other things, in our cash balances being depleted and/or extinguished, or the seizure of
assets, which would have material adverse effect on us and our ability to continue to operate our business. In addition, on March
16, 2015, the Circuit Court in Cook County, Illinois (the  Court ) ruled that the Estate of Sigmund Eisenschenk owns
no less than 177,500 shares of our stock, effectively nullifying the original recall by the Company on December 23, 2011 (88,750
shares post reverse split which took place on March 25, 2015). The Court further awarded sanctions against us for $172,250. The
Court has yet to rule on certain other claims made by the Estate, which relate to a further 472,500 shares (236,250 shares, post
reverse split which took place on March 25, 2015) of our stock, which were originally recalled by the Company on September 19,
2010 (the 472,500 shares effected by the reverse split will amount to 236,250 shares post reverse split which took place on March
25, 2015. We are also subject to various other claims and lawsuits in which adverse outcomes could result in significant monetary
damages.  

We
depend significantly on our relationship with our two third party collaborators.    

A termination or expiration of our current collaboration
with Pfizer, Sanofi or any potential future collaborations would adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation.
The Pfizer MSA provides that we will perform ion channel screening and other contract research for Pfizer Inc. Pfizer Inc. guaranteed
revenue of $1,000,000 for each of the first two years of the agreement, which has and continues to represent a substantial portion
of our revenue. The Sanofi MSA provides that Icagen-T will perform services for Sanofi at our Tucson Facility for the next five
years for payments from Sanofi to Icagen-T of $32 million over the next five, so long as Icagen-T complies with the covenants set
forth in the Sanofi MSA. Our collaboration with Pfizer and/ or Sanofi or future collaborations we may enter into may not be scientifically
or commercially successful. 

Collaborations
with pharmaceutical companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. A termination
or expiration of our current collaboration with Pfizer, Sanofi or any potential future collaborations would adversely affect us
financially and could harm our business reputation.  

If
we do not comply with certain of the covenants under the Sanofi MSA, Sanofi has the right to terminate the Sanofi MSA and foreclose
on its lien on the Tucson Facility.     

The Sanofi MSA has several affirmative and negative
covenants as well as certain maintenance covenants that Icagen-T must comply. Under the Sanofi MSA, the failure to comply with
the maintenance covenants and certain responsibilities with respect to maintenance of the chemical libraries results in the automatic
termination of the Sanofi MSA which would result in termination of the subsidy payments to us as well as the right of Sanofi to
exercise its rights under the Deed of Trust and foreclose on its $5,000,000 lien on the Tucson Facility. 

Our
business is difficult to evaluate because we have recently changed our business model to offering a full complement of screening
services to the broader pharmaceutical sector. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to effectively integrate the Icagen
and Sanofi business    

Since
our acquisition of the Icagen assets, we have shifted our business model from offering only our XRpro screening services to governmental
agencies as we did in the past to now offer a full complement of screening services to the broader pharmaceutical sector. With
the addition of the assets acquired from Sanofi, we now offer ultra high-throuput biology, screening and chemical capabilities.
There is a risk that we will be unable to successfully conduct our business or be able to successfully integrate the assets acquired
with our management and structure. Our estimates of capital, personnel and equipment required for our expanded business model
are based on the experience of management and businesses they are familiar with.   We are subject to the risks such as our
ability to implement our business plan, market acceptance of our services, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with
respect to personnel, financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and uncertainty
of our ability to generate revenues. There is no assurance that our activities will be successful or will result in any revenues
or profit, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the stage of our development. Even if we generate
revenue, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to
consummate our business strategy and plans, as described herein, or that financial, technological, market, or other limitations
may force us to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of such plans. We have insufficient
results for investors to use to identify historical trends or even to make quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results.
You should consider our prospects in light of the risk, expenses and difficulties we will encounter as an early stage company.
Our revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is continually evolving. We are subject to the risks inherent
to the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks.
