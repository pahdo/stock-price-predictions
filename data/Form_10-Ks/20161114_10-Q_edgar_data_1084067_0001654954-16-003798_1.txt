NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

General 

The
accompanying condensed unaudited financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q for quarterly
reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for complete financial statements. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. For
further information, refer to the financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in the Partnership's annual report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. 

Organization 

WNC
Housing Tax Credit Fund VI, L.P., Series 7 (the "Partnership"), is
a California Limited Partnership formed on June 16, 1997 under the
laws of the State of California and commenced operations on
September 3, 1999. The Partnership was formed to acquire limited
partnership interests in other limited partnerships ( Local
Limited Partnerships ) which own multi-family housing
complexes ( Housing Complexes ) that are eligible for
Federal low income housing tax credits ( Low Income Housing
Tax Credits ). The local general partners (the  Local
General Partners ) of each Local Limited Partnership retain
responsibility for maintaining, operating and managing the Housing
Complexes. Each Local Limited Partnership is governed by its
agreement of limited partnership (the  Local Limited
Partnership Agreement ). 

The
general partner of the Partnership is WNC   Associates, Inc., a
California corporation ( Associates  or the
 General Partner ). The chairman and president of
Associates own all of the outstanding stock of Associates. The
business of the Partnership is conducted primarily through
Associates, as the Partnership has no employees of its
own. 

The
Partnership shall continue in full force and effect until December
31, 2060 unless terminated prior to that date pursuant to the
partnership agreement or law. 

The
financial statements include only activity relating to the business
of the Partnership, and do not give effect to any assets that the
partners may have outside of their interests in the Partnership, or
to any obligations, including income taxes, of the
partners. 

The
Partnership Agreement authorized the sale of up to 25,000 units of
limited partnership interests ( Partnership Units ) at
$1,000 per Partnership Unit. The offering of Partnership Units has
concluded and 18,850 Partnership Units, representing subscriptions
in the amount of $18,828,790, net of dealer discounts of $21,210
had been accepted. The General Partner has a 0.1% interest in
operating profits and losses, taxable income and losses, cash
available for distribution from the Partnership and Low Income
Housing Tax Credits of the Partnership. The investors (the
 Limited Partners ) will be allocated the remaining
99.9% of these items in proportion to their respective investments.
As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, 18,795 and 18,825
Partnership Units remain outstanding, respectively.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
continued 

The
proceeds from the disposition of any of the Local Limited
Partnerships Housing Complexes will be used first to pay debts and
other obligations per the respective Local Limited Partnership
Agreement. Any remaining proceeds will then be paid to the
Partnership. The sale of a Housing Complex may be subject to other
restrictions and obligations. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that a Local Limited Partnership will be able to sell its
Housing Complex. Even if it does so, there can be no assurance that
any significant amounts of cash will be distributed to the
Partnership. Should such distributions occur, the Limited Partners
will be entitled to receive distributions equal to their capital
contributions and their return on investment (as defined in the
Partnership Agreement) and the General Partner would then be
entitled to receive proceeds equal to its capital contributions
from the remainder. Any additional sale or refinancing proceeds
will be distributed 90% to the Limited Partners (in proportion to
their respective investments) and 10% to the General
Partner. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

An
investment in the Partnership and the Partnership s
investments in Local Limited Partnerships and their Housing
Complexes are subject to risks. These risks may impact the tax
benefits of an investment in the Partnership, and the amount of
proceeds available for distribution to the Limited Partners, if
any, on liquidation of the Partnership s investments. Some of
those risks include the following: 

The Low
Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated.
Noncompliance with these rules results in the loss of future Low
Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low
Income Housing Tax Credits already taken. In most cases the annual
amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use
is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last
$25,000 of taxable income. The Local Limited Partnerships may be
unable to sell the Housing Complexes at a price which would result
in the Partnership realizing cash distributions or proceeds from
the transaction. Accordingly, the Partnership may be unable to
distribute any cash to its Limited Partners. Low Income Housing Tax
Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in the
Partnership. 

The
Partnership has invested in a limited number of Local Limited
Partnerships. Such limited diversity means that the results of
operation of each single Housing Complex will have a greater impact
on the Partnership. With limited diversity, poor performance of one
Housing Complex could impair the Partnership s ability to
satisfy its investment objectives. Each Housing Complex is subject
to mortgage indebtedness. If a Local Limited Partnership failed to
pay its mortgage, it could lose its Housing Complex in foreclosure.
If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years (the
 Compliance Period ), the loss of any remaining future
Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of prior Low
Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of the Partnership s
investment in the Housing Complex would occur. The Partnership is a
limited partner or a non-managing member of each Local Limited
Partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership will have very limited
rights with respect to management of the Local Limited
Partnerships. The Partnership will rely totally on the Local
General Partners. Neither the Partnership s investments in
Local Limited Partnerships, nor the Local Limited
Partnerships  investments in Housing Complexes, are readily
marketable. To the extent the Housing Complexes receive government
financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or
more of the following risks: difficulties in obtaining tenants for
the Housing Complexes; difficulties in obtaining rent increases;
limitations on cash distributions; limitations on sales or
refinancing of Housing Complexes; limitations on transfers of
interests in Local Limited Partnerships; limitations on removal of
Local General Partners; limitations on subsidy programs; and
possible changes in applicable regulations. Uninsured casualties
could result in loss of property and Low Income Housing Tax Credits
and recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits previously taken.
The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating
economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax,
environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of
similar Housing Complexes, and neighborhood conditions, among
others.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
continued 

The
ability of Limited Partners to claim tax losses from the
Partnership is limited. The IRS may audit the Partnership or a
Local Limited Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax
items. The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses
allocable to Limited Partners could be reduced if the IRS were
successful in such a challenge. 

The
alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an
investment in the Partnership. Changes in tax laws could also
impact the tax benefits from an investment in the Partnership
and/or the value of the Housing Complexes. 

All of the Low Income Housing Tax Credits anticipated to be
realized from the Local Limited Partnerships have been realized.
The Partnership does not anticipate being allocated any Low Income
Housing Tax Credits from the Local Limited Partnerships in the
future. Until all Local Limited Partnerships have completed the 15
year Low Income Housing Tax Credit Compliance Period, risks exist
for potential recapture of prior Low Income Housing Tax Credits
received. 

The Partnership currently has insufficient working capital to fund
its operations. Associates have agreed to continue providing
advances sufficient enough to fund the operations and working
capital requirements of the Partnership through November 30,
2017. 

Anticipated future and existing cash resources of the Partnership
are not sufficient to pay existing liabilities of the Partnership.
However, substantially all of the existing liabilities of the
Partnership are payable to the General Partner and/or its
affiliates. Though the amounts payable to the General Partner
and/or its affiliates are contractually currently payable, the
Partnership anticipates that the General Partner and/or its
affiliates will not require the payment of these contractual
obligations until capital reserves are in excess of the aggregate
of then existing contractual obligations and then anticipated
future foreseeable obligations of the Partnership. The Partnership
would be adversely affected should the General Partner and/or its
affiliates demand current payment of the existing contractual
obligations and or suspend services for this or any other
reason. 

No
trading market for the Partnership Units exists or is expected to
develop. Limited Partners may be unable to sell their Partnership
Units except at a discount and should consider their Partnership
Units to be a long-term investment. Individual Limited Partners
will have no recourse if they disagree with actions authorized by a
vote of the majority of Limited Partners. 

Exit Strategy 

The
Compliance Period for a Housing Complex is generally 15 years
following construction or rehabilitation completion. Associates was
one of the first in the industry to offer syndicated investments in
Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The initial programs have completed
their Compliance Periods. 

Upon
the sale of a Local Limited Partnership or Housing Complex after
the end of the Compliance Period, there would be no recapture of
Low Income Housing Tax Credits. A sale prior to the end of the
Compliance Period could result in recapture if certain conditions
are not met. Three of the remaining Local Limited Partnerships have
completed their Compliance Period as of September 30,
2016. 

With
that in mind, the General Partner is continuing its review of the
Housing Complexes, with special emphasis on the more mature Housing
Complexes such as any that have satisfied the IRS compliance
requirements. The review considers many factors, including extended
use requirements (such as those due to mortgage restrictions or
state compliance agreements), the condition of the Housing
Complexes, and the tax consequences to the Limited Partners from
the sale of the Housing Complexes.

Upon
identifying those Housing Complexes with the highest potential for
a successful sale, refinancing or syndication, the Partnership
expects to proceed with efforts to liquidate them. The objective is
to maximize the Limited Partners  return wherever possible
and, ultimately, to wind down the Partnership as Low Income Housing
Tax Credits are no longer available. Local Limited Partnership
interests may be disposed of any time by the General Partner in its
discretion. While liquidation of the Housing Complexes continues to
be evaluated, the dissolution of the Partnership was not imminent
as of September 30, 2016. 

Upon
management of the Partnership identifying a Local Limited
Partnership for disposition, costs incurred by the Partnership in
preparation for the disposition are deferred. Upon the sale of the
Local Limited Partnership interest, the Partnership nets the costs
that had been deferred against the proceeds from the sale in
determining the gain or loss on sale of the Local Limited
Partnership. Deferred disposition costs are included in other
assets on the condensed balance sheets. 

As of
March 31, 2016, the Partnership sold its Local Limited Partnership
interest in Stroud Housing Associates, L.P., Lake Village
Apartments, L.P., Ozark Properties III, Tahlequah Properties IV,
Red Oaks Estates, 2 nd  Fairhaven, LLC,
School Square Limited Partnership and United Development LP
2000. 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Partnership has identified the following
Local Limited Partnerships for possible disposition: 

(*)
Estimated sales price and estimated sale date has not yet to be
determined. 

(**)
This amount has been received by the Partnership as of September
30, 2016 and is recorded as prepaid disposition proceeds in the
accompany condensed balance sheets.

Sold subsequent to September 30, 2016 (Note 5) 

The
Compliance Period for Montrose Country Estates LDHA LP and ACN
Southern Hills Partners II, LP has expired so there is no risk of
recapture to the investors. Timberwolf Townhomes Limited
Partnership will complete its Compliance period in
2016.

The
proceeds from the disposition of any of the Housing Complexes will
be used first to pay debts and other obligations per the respective
Local Limited Partnership Agreement. Any remaining proceeds will be
paid to the Partners of the Local Limited Partnership, including
the Partnership, in according to the terms of the particular Local
Limited Partnership Agreement. The sale may be subject to other
obligations and restrictions. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that a Local Limited Partnership will be able to sell its
Housing Complexes. Even if it does so, there can be no assurance
that any significant amounts of cash will be distributed to the
Partnership, as the proceeds would be used first to pay Local
Limited Partnership s obligations and funding
reserves. 

Method of Accounting for Investments in Local Limited
Partnerships 

The
Partnership accounts for its investments in Local Limited
Partnerships using the equity method of accounting, whereby the
Partnership adjusts its investment balance for its share of the
Local Limited Partnerships  results of operations and for any
contributions made and distributions received. The Partnership
reviews the carrying amount of an individual investment in a Local
Limited Partnership for possible impairment at least annually or
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such investment may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of such investment is measured by the estimated
value derived by management, generally consisting of the sum of the
remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits estimated to be
allocable to the Partnership and any estimated residual value to
the Partnership. If an investment is considered to be impaired, the
Partnership reduces the carrying value of its investment in any
such Local Limited Partnership. The accounting policies of the
Local Limited Partnerships, generally, are expected to be
consistent with those of the Partnership. Costs incurred by the
Partnership 

in
acquiring the investments are capitalized as part of the investment
account and were being amortized over 30 years (see Note
2). 

Equity
in losses of Local Limited Partnerships  for the periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 has been recorded by the
Partnership. Management s estimate for the three and
six-month periods is based on either actual unaudited results
reported by the Local Limited Partnerships or historical trends in
the operations of the Local Limited Partnerships. Equity in losses
of Local Limited Partnerships allocated to the Partnership is not
recognized to the extent that the   investment balance would be
adjusted below zero. If the Local Limited Partnerships reported net
income in future years, the Partnership will resume applying the
equity method only after its share of such net income equals the
share of net losses not recognized during the period(s) the equity
method was suspended (see Note 2). 

In
accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of
variable interest entities, the Partnership determines when it
should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a
variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and
when it should disclose information about its relationship with a
VIE. The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity
should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors. A
VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets,
which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary
beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities
of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic
performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive
benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If
multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party
will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the guidance
requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a
VIE.

(Unaudited) 

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
continued 

Based
on this guidance, the Local Limited Partnerships in which the
Partnership invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners
of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to
direct their operations. However, management does not consolidate
the Partnership's interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered
to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to
direct the activities that are considered most significant to the
economic performance of these entities. The Partnership currently
records the amount of its investment in these Local Limited
Partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its
share of partnership income or losses in the statements
of 

operations,
and discloses how it accounts for material types of these
investments in its financial statements. The Partnership's balance
in investment in Local Limited Partnerships, plus the risk of
recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these
investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss. The
Partnership's exposure to loss on these Local Limited Partnerships
is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the
underlying Housing Complexes as well as the strength of the Local
General Partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to
the investors in the Partnership. 

Distributions received from the Local Limited Partnerships are
accounted for as a reduction of the investment
balance. Distributions received after the investment has
reached zero are recognized as distribution income. As of all
periods presented, all investment balances in Local Limited
Partnerships had reached zero. 

Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ
from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The
Partnership considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the
Partnership had $281,912 and $213,363 of cash equivalents,
respectively. 

Reporting Comprehensive Income 

The
Partnership had no items of other comprehensive income for all
periods presented. 

Income Taxes 

The Partnership has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity
for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income
taxes. Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax
credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on
their respective income tax returns. The Partnership s
federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal
status as a partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership is not
required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a
pass-through entity. The Partnership is required to file and does
file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing
authorities. Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect
a provision for income taxes and the Partnership has no other tax
positions which must be considered for disclosure.  Income
tax returns filed by the Partnership are subject to examination by
the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years. While no
income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal
Revenue Service, tax years since 2013 remain open.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
continued 

Net Income (Loss) per Partnership Unit 

Net
income (loss) per Partnership Unit includes no dilution and is
computed by dividing income (loss) allocated to Limited Partners by
the weighted average number of Partnership Units outstanding during
the period. Calculation of diluted net loss per Partnership Unit is
not required. 

Revenue Recognition 

The
Partnership is entitled to receive reporting fees from the Local
Limited Partnerships. The intent of the reporting fees is to offset
(in part) administrative costs incurred by the Partnership in
corresponding with the Local Limited Partnerships. Due to the
uncertainty of the collection of these fees, the Partnership
recognizes reporting fees as collections are made. 

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In January 2014, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and
disclosure requirements for investments in qualified affordable
housing projects. The amendments provide guidance on accounting for
investments by a reporting entity in flow-through limited liability
entities that manage or invest in affordable housing projects that
qualify for the low-income housing tax credit. The amendments
permit reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to
account for their investments in qualified affordable housing
projects using the proportional amortization method if certain
conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an
entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion
to the tax credits and other tax benefits received, and recognize
the net investment performance in the income statement as a
component of income tax expense (benefit). The amendments are
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2014 and should be applied retrospectively to all periods
presented. Early adoption was permitted. The adoption of this
update did not materially affect the Partnership's financial
statements. 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.      2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810):
Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis . This will improve
certain areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations
that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate certain legal
entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability
corporations and securitization structures. ASU   2015-02 simplifies and improves GAAP by:
eliminating the presumption that a general partner should
consolidate a limited partnership, eliminating the indefinite
deferral of FASB Statement No. 167, thereby reducing the number of
Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from four to
two (including the limited partnership consolidation model) and
clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to
include in the consolidation of VIEs. ASU   2015-02 is effective for periods beginning after
December 15, 2015. The adoption of this update did not materially
affect the Partnership's financial statements.  

NOTE 2 - INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS 

As of
September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Partnership owns Local
Limited Partnership interests in 5 Local Limited Partnerships, each
of which owns one Housing Complex consisting of an aggregate of 232
apartment units. The Local General Partners of the Local Limited
Partnerships manage the day to day operations of the entities.
Significant Local Limited Partnership business decisions require
approval from the Partnership. The Partnership, as a Limited
Partner, is generally entitled to 99.98%, as specified in the Local
Limited Partnership Agreements, of the operating profits and
losses, taxable income and losses, and Low Income Housing Tax
Credits of the Local Limited Partnerships.

NOTE 2 - INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS,
continued 

Selected
financial information for the six months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 from the unaudited combined condensed financial statements
of the Local Limited Partnerships in which the Partnership has
invested is as follows: 

Certain
Local Limited Partnerships have incurred significant operating
losses and/or have working capital deficiencies. In the event these
Local Limited Partnerships continue to incur significant operating
losses, additional capital contributions by the Partnership may be
required to sustain operations of such Local Limited Partnerships.
If additional capital contributions are not made when they are
required, the Partnership's investments in certain of such Local
Limited Partnerships could be impaired, and the loss and recapture
of the related Low Income Housing Tax Credits could
occur. 

NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

Under
the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership has paid or
is obligated to the General Partner or its affiliates the following
fees: 

a) 

  An annual asset
management fee equal to 0.2% of the invested assets of the
Partnership, as defined.  Invested Assets  means the
sum of the Partnership s investment in Local Limited
Partnership interests and the Partnership s allocable share
of mortgage loans on and other debts related to the Housing
Complexes owned by such Local Limited Partnerships. Asset
management fees of $12,654 and $18,385 were incurred during the six
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $40,000
and $146,502 was paid during the six months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

b) 

  A subordinated
disposition fee in an amount equal to 1% of the sales price of real
estate sold. Payment of this fee is subordinated to the Limited
Partners receiving a return on investment (as defined in the
Partnership Agreement) and is payable only if the General Partner
or its affiliates render services in the sales effort. No such fee
was incurred for all the periods presented.

respectively. 

The
accrued fees and expenses due to the General Partner and affiliates
consisted of the following at: 

The
General Partner and affiliates do not anticipate that these accrued
fees will be paid until such time as capital reserves are in excess
of future foreseeable working capital requirements of the
Partnership. 

NOTE 4 - DUE FROM AFFILIATES, NET 

At
September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, loans receivable of $63,098
and $64,312, respectively, were due from one Local Limited
Partnership, ACN Southern Hills II, L.P. ( Southern
Hills ), in which the Partnership owns a 99.98% interest. The
loan receivable is in the form of a 20 year promissory note, is
subordinate to the first mortgage on the property, due in full on
August 30, 2022 and earns interest at a rate of 8% per annum. The
most recent payments of $5,912, $17,387 and $27,066 were received
during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and the years ended
March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were included in other
income on the statements of operations. As of all periods
presented, the full receivable has been reduced by a valuation
allowance. 

NOTE 5 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Subsequent
to September 30, 2016, the Partnership sold its Local Limited
Partnership interest in Montrose Country Estates LDHA LP
( Montrose ). Montrose was appraised for $28,000 and
had a debt balance of $653,131 as of December 31, 2015. The
Partnership received $40,000 in cash proceeds during the six months
ended September 30, 2016 which is recorded as prepaid disposition
proceeds in the accompany condensed balance sheets. The Partnership
incurred $3,750 in sale related expenses which will be netted
against the proceeds from the sale in calculating the gain on sale.
The Partnership s investment balance is zero; therefore, a
gain of $36,250 will be recorded. The Compliance Period has been
completed therefore there is no risk of recapture and investor
approval was not required.

2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements 

With
the exception of the discussion regarding historical information,
this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  and other discussions
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q contain forward looking statements.
Such statements are based on current expectations subject to
uncertainties and other factors which may involve known and unknown
risks that could cause actual results of operations to differ
materially from those projected or implied. Further, certain
forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions about future
events which may not prove to be accurate. 

Risks
and uncertainties inherent in forward looking statements include,
but are not limited to, the Partnership s future cash flows
and ability to obtain sufficient financing, level of operating
expenses, conditions in the Low Income Housing Tax Credit property
market and the economy in general, as well as legal proceedings.
Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the operating
results for any future period. 

Subsequent
written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the
Partnership or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by cautionary statements in this Form 10-Q and in
other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

The
following discussion and analysis compares the results of
operations for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
and should be read in conjunction with the condensed unaudited
financial statements and accompanying notes included within this
report. 

Financial Condition 

The
Partnership s assets at September 30, 2016 consisted of
$282,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $8,000 in other assets.
Liabilities at September 30, 2016 consisted of $188,000 of accrued
fees and expenses payable to the General Partner and affiliates and
$40,000 of prepaid disposition proceeds. 

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months
Ended September 30, 2015.  The Partnership s net income
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $66,000,
reflecting an increase of $71,000 from the $5,000 net loss for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The Partnership received
$103,000 of reporting fees and distribution income for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,000 received during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Reporting fees and
distributions vary depending on when the Local Limited
Partnerships  cash flows will allow for the payment. There
was no gain on sale from Local Limited Partnership during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $30,000 recorded during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The gains recorded by
the Partnership can vary depending on the sale prices and the
values of the Housing Complexes that are sold. Asset management
fees decreased by $2,000 during the three months ended September
30, 2016. The fees are calculated based on the value of invested
assets, which decreased due to the sales of Local Limited
Partnerships. Legal and accounting fees increased by $5,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015 due to legal settlement fees and the
timing of work performed. Other expenses decreased by $3,000 during
the three months ended September 30, 2016, due mainly to appraisal
expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30,
2015.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations, continued 

Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended
September 30, 2015.  The Partnership s net income for
the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $40,000, reflecting a
decrease of $115,000 from the $155,000 net income for the six
months ended September 30, 2015. The Partnership received $107,000
of reporting fees and distribution income for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $161,000 received during the six
months ended September 30, 2015. Reporting fees and distributions
vary depending on when the Local Limited Partnerships  cash
flows will allow for the payment. In addition, the Partnership
received $6,000 as payment for principal and interest previously
reserved on the note due from an affiliate during the six months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to no payment received during the
six months ended September 30, 2015. There was no gain on sale from
Local Limited Partnership for the six months ended September 30,
2016 compared to a $56,000 gain recorded during the six months
ended September 30, 2015. The gain recorded by the Partnership can
vary depending on the sale prices and the values of the Housing
Complexes that are sold. Asset management fees decreased by $5,000
during the six months ended September 30, 2016. The fees are
calculated based on the value of invested assets, which decreased
due to the sales of Local Limited Partnerships. Legal and
accounting fees increased by $27,000 for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended September 30,
2015 due to legal settlement fees and the timing of work performed.
Other expenses decreased by $11,000 during the six months ended
September 30, 2016, due mainly to appraisal expenses incurred
during the six months ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended
September 30, 2015.  The net increase in cash and cash
equivalents during the six months ended September 30, 2016 was
$69,000 compared to a net increase in cash and cash equivalents for
the six months ended September 30, 2015 of $37,000. The change was
mainly due to $48,000 less of reporting fees, distribution income
and other income received for the six months ended September 30,
2016 compared to September 30, 2015 as discussed above. In
addition, the Partnership paid $40,000 in accrued asset management
fees and $42,000 of operating advances to the General Partner or
affiliates during the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $147,000 and $50,000, respectively, paid during the six months
ended September 30, 2015. The reimbursement of operating expenses
and asset management fees are paid after management reviews the
cash position of the Partnership. The Partnership received $40,000
prepaid disposition proceeds during the six months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $56,000 disposition proceeds  from the sale of three Local Limited
Partnerships    during
the six months ended September 30, 2015. Proceeds received from
dispositions vary from period to period, as discussed
above. 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, accrued payables, which
consist primarily of related party asset management fees and
advances due to the General Partner, decreased by approximately
$7,000. The General Partner does not anticipate that these accrued
fees and advances will be paid until such time as capital reserves
are in excess of foreseeable working capital requirements of the
Partnership. 

The
Partnership expects its future cash flows, together with its net
available assets as of September 30, 2016, to be insufficient to
meet all currently foreseeable future cash requirements. Associates
has agreed to continue providing advances sufficient enough to fund
the operations and working capital requirements of the Partnership
through November 31, 2017.

Risks 

NOT
APPLICABLE 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a)             

Disclosure controls and procedures 

As of
the end of the period covered by this report, the
Partnership s General Partner, under the supervision and with
the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of Associates, carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Partnership s  disclosure controls
and procedures  as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based on that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that,
as of the end of the period covered by this report, the
Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective to ensure that material information required to be
disclosed in the Partnership s periodic report filings with
SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
period specified by the SEC s rules and forms, consistent
with the definition of  disclosure controls and
procedures  under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. 

The
Partnership must rely on the Local Limited Partnerships to provide
the Partnership with certain information necessary to the timely
filing of the Partnership s periodic reports. Factors in the
accounting at the Local Limited Partnerships have caused delays in
the provision of such information during past reporting periods,
and resulted in the Partnership s inability to file its
periodic reports in a timely manner. 

Once
the Partnership has received the necessary information from the
Local Limited Partnerships, the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer of Associates believe that the material
information required to be disclosed in the Partnership s
periodic report filings with SEC is effectively recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, albeit not in a timely manner.
Going forward, the Partnership will use the means reasonably within
its power to impose procedures designed to obtain from the Local
Limited Partnerships the information necessary to the timely filing
of the Partnership s periodic reports. 

(b)             

Changes in internal controls 

There
were no changes in the Partnership s internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal
control over financial reporting.

ensure that material information relating to the registrant,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
others within those entities, particularly during the period in
which this report is being prepared; 

(b) 

  Designed such
internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal
control over financial reporting to be designed under our
supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles; 

(c) 

  Evaluated the
effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the
end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;
and 

(d) 

  Disclosed in this
report any change in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most
recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in
the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting; and 

5. 

  The registrant's
other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most
recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the
registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
equivalent functions): 

(a) 

  All significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information;
and 

(b) 

  Any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.
