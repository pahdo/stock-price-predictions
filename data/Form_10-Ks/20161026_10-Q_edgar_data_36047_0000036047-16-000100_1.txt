Note 1   Basis of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
    
  CoreLogic, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively "we", "us" or "our"), is a leading global property information, analytics and data-enabled solutions provider operating in North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific. Our combined data from public, contributory and proprietary sources provides detailed coverage of property, mortgages and other encumbrances, consumer credit, tenancy, location, hazard risk and related performance information. The markets we serve include real estate and mortgage finance, insurance, capital markets and the public sector. We deliver value to clients through unique data, analytics, work flow technology, advisory and managed solutions. Clients rely on us to help identify and manage growth opportunities, improve performance and mitigate risk. 
    
  Our condensed consolidated financial information included in this report has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) for interim financial information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts may differ from these estimated amounts. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The 2015 year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Interim financial information does not require the inclusion of all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year or for any future periods. 
    
  Client Concentration 
    
  We generate the majority of our revenues from clients with operations in the U.S. residential real estate, mortgage origination and mortgage servicing markets. Approximately   41.2%   and   30.3%   of our operating revenues for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   41.6%   and   32.7%   of our operating revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were generated from our top ten clients, who consist of the largest U.S. mortgage originators and servicers.   Two   of our clients accounted for approximately   14.6%   and   11.3%   of our operating revenues for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and approximately   14.6%   and   11.5%   of our operating revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   No   client accounted for   10.0%   or more of our operating revenues for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Out-of-Period Adjustment 
    
    During the first quarter of 2015, we identified an error which overstated our interest expense by   $5.2 million   (  $3.1 million  , net of tax), reflected within continuing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2014. We recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct the error in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, which increased basic and diluted net income per share by   $0.03  . We assessed the materiality of this error and concluded the error was not material to the results of operations or financial condition for the prior annual or interim periods. 
    
  Comprehensive Income 
    
  Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Specifically, foreign currency translation adjustments, amounts related to supplemental benefit plans, unrealized gains and losses on interest rate swap transactions and unrealized gains and losses on investment are recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss). 

6 

The following table shows the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Marketable Securities 
    
  Debt securities are carried at fair value and consist primarily of investments in obligations of various corporations and mortgage-backed securities. Equity securities are carried at fair value and consist primarily of investments in marketable common and preferred stock. We classify our publicly traded debt and equity securities as available-for-sale and carry them at fair value with unrealized gains or losses classified as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our marketable securities consist primarily of investments in preferred stock of   $21.8 million   and   $22.7 million  , respectively. There were no gains or losses recognized on sales of marketable securities for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest 
    
  Mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests for which there is a contractual requirement to purchase the interest are included as a liability of NZD  $27.8 million  , or   $19.0 million  , in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  . In January 2016, we acquired the remaining   40.0%   interest in New Zealand-based Property IQ Ltd. ("PIQ") and settled the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest. As a result, there was no mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest balance as of   September 30, 2016  . See   Note 13 - Acquisitions   for further discussion. 
    
  Tax Escrow Disbursement Arrangements 
    
  We administer tax escrow disbursements as a service to our clients in connection with our property tax processing solutions. These deposits are maintained in segregated accounts for the benefit of our clients. Tax escrow deposits totaled   $1.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $340.3 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . Because these deposits are held on behalf of our clients, they are not our funds and, therefore, are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  These deposits generally remain in the accounts for a period of   two   to   five   business days. We earn interest income or earnings credits from these deposits and bear the cost of bank-related fees. 
    
  Under our contracts with our clients, if we make a payment in error or fail to pay a taxing authority when a payment is due, we could be held liable to our clients for all or part of the financial loss they suffer as a result of our act or omission. We maintained claim reserves relating to incorrect disposition of assets of   $20.0 million   and   $21.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which is reflected in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues that were either unclear or where no specific guidance was provided. The specific issues include i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments; iii) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; iv) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; v) proceeds from the settlement of company-owned life insurance; vi) distributions received from equity method investees; vii) beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and, viii) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted. We have elected early adoption and the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

7 

In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance for accounting of credit losses affecting the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use a new forward-looking current expected credit loss model for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments, which will generally lead to an earlier recognition of loss allowances. Entities will recognize losses on available-for-sale debt securities as allowances rather than a reduction in amortized cost of the security while the measurement process of this loss does not change. Disclosure requirements are expanded regarding an entity s assumptions, models and methods of estimations of the allowance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted but we do not anticipate electing early adoption. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify some provisions in stock compensation accounting. The accounting for income taxes requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized through income tax expense. The statement of cash flows presentation of excess tax benefits should be classified with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. An entity may also make an entity-wide election to either continue estimating the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The requirements to qualify for equity classification permits tax withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. Lastly, payments of cash by an employer for tax-withholding purposes, when directly withholding shares, are classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted but we do not anticipate electing early adoption. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
    In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance on equity method accounting related to joint venture investments. The standard eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence related to an investment. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted but we do not anticipate electing early adoption. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance on derivatives and hedging. The standard clarifies the four-step decision sequence required for assessing whether contingent put and call options that can speed up the payment for a debt instrument s principal are clearly and closely related to the debt to which they are attached. The standard also clarifies that provided all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met, a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument does not in itself disqualify designation of the hedge. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted but we do not anticipate electing early adoption. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
       
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on lease accounting. The standard requires all leases in excess of 12-months to be recognized on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not changed significantly from prior GAAP. For operating leases, a lessee is required to i) recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payment, ii) recognize a single lease cost over the lease term generally on a straight-line basis, and iii) classify all cash payments within operating activities on the cash flow statement. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted but we do not anticipate electing early adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities. The standard does not apply to equity method investments or investments in consolidated subsidiaries. The update provides that equity investments with readily determinable values be measured at fair value and changes in the fair value flow through net income. These changes historically have run through other comprehensive income. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values have the option to be measured at fair value or at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment. Changes in either method are also recognized in net income. The standard requires a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators at each reporting period. For financial liabilities, entities that elect the fair value option must recognize the change in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income rather than net income. Lastly, regarding deferred tax assets, the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset will need to be assessed related to available-for-sale debt securities. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted but we do not anticipate electing early adoption. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  
   8 

In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and earlier adoption is permitted.  As of March 31, 2016, we elected early adoption on a prospective basis and, as of   September 30, 2016  , we presented   $2.2 million   of deferred income tax assets, long term and   $109.7 million   of deferred income tax liabilities, long term in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

Note 2   Investment in Affiliates, Net 
    
  Investments in affiliates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting when we are deemed to have significant influence over the affiliate but do not control or have a majority voting interest in the affiliate. Investments are carried at the cost of acquisition, including subsequent capital contributions and loans from us, plus our equity in undistributed earnings or losses since inception of the investment. 
    
  One of our subsidiaries previously owned a   50.1%   interest in RELS LLC ("RELS"), a provider of appraisals and appraisal management services used in connection with mortgage loan originations. This investment contributed   80.2%   and   83.5%   of our total equity in earnings of affiliates, net of tax, for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. We acquired the remaining interest in RELS in December 2015. See   Note 13 - Acquisitions   for further discussion. The following summarizes the financial information for this investment (assuming   100%   ownership interest): 

We recorded equity in earnings of affiliates, net of tax of   $0.6 million   and   $3.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and equity in earnings of affiliates, net of tax of   $0.6 million   and   $11.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded   $2.5 million   and   $4.8 million  , respectively, of operating revenues and   $2.9 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively, of operating expenses related to our investment in affiliates. In addition, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded   $7.7 million   and   $14.2 million  , respectively, of operating revenues and   $8.4 million   and   $9.7 million  , respectively, of operating expenses related to our investment in affiliates. 

Note 3 - Property and Equipment, Net 
    
  Property and equipment, net as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consists of the following: 

9 

Depreciation expense for property and equipment was approximately   $21.1 million   and   $18.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $61.7 million   and   $56.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

Note 4   Goodwill, Net 
    
  A reconciliation of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and accumulated impairment losses, by operating segment and reporting unit, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is as follows: 

In connection with the acquisition of FNC, Inc. ("FNC"), we recorded   $218.3 million   of goodwill within our Property Intelligence ("PI") reporting unit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Further, we recorded   $1.2 million   of goodwill, within our PI reporting unit, related to an acquisition that was not significant. See   Note 13 - Acquisitions   for additional information. 

Note 5   Other Intangible Assets, Net 
    
  Other intangible assets, net consist of the following: 

Amortization expense for other intangible assets, net was   $13.9 million   and   $9.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $38.8 million   and   $28.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Estimated amortization expense for other intangible assets, net is as follows: 

10 

Note 6   Long-Term Debt 
    
  Our long-term debt consists of the following: 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have recorded   $2.4 million   and   $3.6 million   of accrued interest expense on our debt-related instruments. 
    
  Senior Notes 
    
  In May 2011, we issued   $400.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   7.25%   senior notes due 2021 (the "Notes"). In July 2016, we completed the redemption of all outstanding balances under the Notes, which included a premium on debt extinguishment payment in the amount of   $14.2 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Credit Agreement 
    
    In July 2016, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a   $1.3 billion   term loan facility (the "Term Facility") and a   $550.0 million   revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"). The Term Facility matures and the Revolving Facility expires in April 2020. The Revolving Facility includes a   $100.0 million   multicurrency revolving sub-facility and a   $50.0 million   letter of credit sub-facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for the ability to request that the lenders increase the Term Facility by up to   $225.0 million   in the aggregate; however, the lenders are not obligated to do so. 
    
  The loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our election, at (i) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) the London interbank offering rate for Eurocurrency borrowings, adjusted for statutory reserves, plus the Applicable Rate. The initial Applicable Rate for Alternate Base Rate borrowings is   0.75%   and for Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) borrowings is   1.75%  . Starting with the full fiscal quarter after the closing date, the Applicable Rate will vary depending on our leverage ratio. The minimum Applicable Rate for Alternate Base Rate borrowings will be   0.25%   and the maximum will be   1.00%  . The minimum Applicable Rate for Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate borrowings will be   1.25%   and the maximum will be   2.00%  . The Credit  
  
   11 

Agreement also requires us to pay commitment fees for the unused portion of the Revolving Facility, which will be a minimum of   0.25%   and a maximum of   0.40%  , depending on our leverage ratio. 
    
  The Credit Agreement provides that loans under the Term Facility must be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in   September 2016   and continuing on each three-month anniversary thereafter in an amount equal to   $17.2 million   for the first four quarterly payments,   $34.4 million   for the next four quarterly payments and   $51.6 million   for each quarterly payment thereafter through March 2020. The outstanding balance of the Term Facility will be due in April 2020. 
       
  The Credit Agreement contains financial maintenance covenants, including a (i) maximum total leverage ratio not to exceed   4.50   to   1.00   (stepped down to   4.25   to   1.00   starting with the fiscal quarter ending June 2017, with a further step down to   3.75   to   1.00   starting with the fiscal quarter ending June 2018 and stepped down to   3.50   to   1.00   starting with the fiscal quarter ending June 2019) and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than   3.00   to   1.00  . See   Note 13 - Acquisitions   for further discussion.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility of   $295.0 million   and we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
       
  Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  In connection with the amendment and restatement of the Credit Agreement, we incurred approximately   $6.3 million   of debt issuance costs of which   $0.3 million   were expensed in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We capitalized the remaining   $6.0 million   of debt issuance costs within long-term debt, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, and will amortize these costs over the term of the Credit Agreement. We had unamortized costs of   $14.0 million   related to previously recorded debt issuance costs, which we will amortize over the term of the Credit Agreement. In connection with the redemption of the Notes in July 2016, we wrote-off   $10.2 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded   $6.5 million   of debt issuance costs of which   $0.4 million   were expensed in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and we capitalized the remaining   $6.1 million   of debt issuance costs within long-term debt, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Further, we wrote-off   $1.6 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  7.55% Senior Debentures 
    
  In April 1998, we issued   $100.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   7.55%   senior debentures due 2028. In April 2010, in anticipation of the spin-off of our financial services businesses into a new, publicly-traded, New York Stock Exchange-listed company called First American Financial Corporation ("FAFC") in June 2010 ("Separation"), we commenced a cash tender offer for these debentures and also solicited consent from the holders thereof to expressly affirm that the Separation would not conflict with the terms of the debentures. See   Note 12 - Litigation and Regulatory Contingencies   for further discussion on the Separation. In April 2010, we announced that valid consents were tendered representing over   50.0%   of the outstanding debentures. Accordingly, we received the requisite approvals from debenture holders and amended the related indentures. The indentures governing these debentures, as amended, contain limited restrictions on the Company. 
    
  Interest Rate Swaps 
    
  We have entered into amortizing interest rate swaps ("Swaps") in order to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure on the Term Facility floating rate borrowings from variable to fixed. In August 2016, we entered into Swaps which became effective in September 2016 and terminate in April 2020. The Swaps entered in August 2016 are for an initial notional balance of   $500.0 million  , with a fixed interest rate of   1.03%  , and amortize quarterly by   $25.0 million   through December 2018, with a notional step up of   $100.0 million   in March 2019, continued quarterly amortization of   $25.0 million   through April 2020, and a remaining notional amount of   $275.0 million  . In May 2014, we entered into Swaps which became effective in December 2014 and terminate in March 2019. The Swaps entered in May 2014 are for an initial notional balance of   $500.0 million  , with a fixed interest rate of   1.57%  , and amortize quarterly by   $12.5 million   through December 31, 2017 and   $25.0 million   through December 31, 2018, with a remaining notional amount of   $250.0 million  .  

12 

We have designated the Swaps as cash flow hedges. The estimated fair value of these cash flow hedges resulted in a liability of   $8.7 million   and   $4.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. 
    
  Unrealized losses of   $0.4 million   (net of   $0.2 million   in deferred taxes) and unrealized losses of   $2.0 million   (net of   $1.3 million   in deferred taxes) for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and unrealized losses of   $2.7 million   (net of   $1.7 million   in deferred taxes) and   $3.1 million   (net of   $1.9 million   in deferred taxes) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were recognized in other comprehensive (loss)/income related to the Swaps. 

Note 7   Income Taxes 
    
  The effective income tax rate for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before equity in earnings of affiliates and income taxes was   31.0%   and   46.4%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   33.5%   and   37.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to   2015  , the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to current year favorable rate reductions related to foreign tax rate differentials, permanent enactment of the federal research credit subsequent to September 30, 2015 and a reduction in the contingent consideration recorded in connection with the acquisition of FNC. The prior year rate was unfavorably impacted by unbenefited foreign losses in tax jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. and a decrease in foreign tax credits. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to   2015  , the decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to current year favorable rate reductions related to foreign tax rate differentials, permanent enactment of the federal research credit subsequent to September 30, 2015 and a reduction in the contingent consideration recorded in connection with the acquisition of FNC. The current year favorable rate reductions were partially offset by prior year non-recurring favorable discrete items related to release of a foreign valuation allowance and a reduction in foreign uncertain tax benefits due to statute of limitations expiration. 
    
  Income taxes included in equity in earnings of affiliates were   $0.5 million   and   $2.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.9 million   and   $7.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the purpose of segment reporting, these amounts are included in corporate and therefore not reflected in our reportable segments. 
    
  We are currently under examination for the years 2005 to 2011 by the U.S. federal and various state taxing authorities. It is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain unrecognized tax positions could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. We estimate the unrecognized tax benefit could decrease by up to   $21.5 million   within the next twelve months. The estimated change is primarily related to IRS audits, subject to the FAFC indemnification, and may have minimal impact to net income. See   Note 12 - Litigation and Regulatory Contingencies   for further discussion on FAFC.

Note 8   Earnings Per Share 
    
  The following is a reconciliation of net income per share:   

The dilutive effect of stock-based compensation awards has been calculated using the treasury-stock method. For both the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no anti-dilutive common shares. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , an aggregate of less than   0.1 million   and   0.3 million   of stock options, respectively, were excluded from the weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding due to their anti-dilutive effect. 

Note 9   Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.  
    
  The market approach is applied for recurring fair value measurements and endeavors to utilize the best available information. Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Fair value balances are classified based on the observability of those inputs.  
    
  A fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). Level 2 measurements utilize observable inputs in markets other than active markets. 
    
  In estimating the fair value of the financial instruments presented, we used the following methods and assumptions: 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents 
    
  For cash and cash equivalents, we believe that the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. 
  
   14 

Restricted cash 
    
  Restricted cash is comprised of certificates of deposit that are pledged for various letters of credit. We deem the carrying value to be a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the nature of these instruments. 
    
  Marketable securities 
    
  Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities and are valued using quoted prices in active markets. 
    
  Contingent consideration 
    
    The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which relies on significant assumption and estimates including discount rates and future market conditions, among others. 
    
  Long-term debt 
    
  The fair value of long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates available to us for similar debt of the same remaining maturities and consideration of our default and credit risk. 
    
  Interest rate swap agreements     
    
  The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on market-value quotes received from the counterparties to the agreements. 
    
  The fair values of our financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   are presented in the following table: 

15 

The fair values of our financial instruments as of   December 31, 2015   are presented in the following table: 

There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 securities during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . In connection with the contingent consideration, we recorded gains of   $4.0 million   and   $3.1 million   in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 

Note 10   Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  We currently issue equity awards under the Amended and Restated CoreLogic, Inc. 2011 Performance Incentive Plan, which was initially approved by our stockholders at our Annual Meeting held on May 19, 2011 with an amendment and restatement approved by our stockholders at our Annual Meeting held on July 29, 2014 (the  Plan ). The Plan includes the ability to grant restricted stock unit ("RSUs"), performance-based stock units ("PBRSUs") and stock options. The Plan provides for up to   21,909,000   shares of the Company's common stock to be available for award grants. Prior to the approval of the Plan, we issued share-based awards under the CoreLogic, Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan.  
    
  We primarily utilize RSUs and PBRSUs as our share-based compensation instruments for employees and directors. The fair value of any share-based compensation instrument grant is based on the market value of our shares on the date of grant and is recognized as compensation expense over its vesting period. 
    
  Restricted Stock Units 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we awarded   967,826   and   943,486   RSUs, respectively, with an estimated grant-date fair value of   $33.7 million   and   $33.3 million  , respectively. The majority of the RSU awards will vest ratably over   three   years from their grant date. 
    
  RSU activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

16 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $36.9 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.1 years  . The fair value of RSUs is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. 
    
  Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we awarded   285,475   and   222,788   PBRSUs, respectively, with an estimated grant-date fair value of   $10.1 million   and   $7.6 million  , respectively. These awards are subject to service-based, performance-based and market-based vesting conditions. For the majority of the PBRSUs awarded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the performance period is from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 and the performance metric is adjusted earnings per share and market-based conditions. Subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria, the majority of the 2016 awards will vest on December 31, 2018. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the awards included   111,598   PBRSUs issued in conjunction with acquisitions  .   The performance metric is total revenue with the performance period through December 31, 2018. 
    
  The performance period for the PBRSUs awarded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   is from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017 and the performance metric is adjusted earnings per share and market-based conditions. Subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria, the majority of the 2015 awards will vest on December 31, 2017. 
    
  The fair values of the 2016 and 2015 awards were estimated using Monte-Carlo simulation with the following weighted-average assumptions: 

(1) 
    The risk-free interest rate for the periods within the contractual term of the PBRSUs is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. 
              (2) 
    The expected volatility and average total stockholder return are measures of the amount by which a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate based primarily on our and our peers' historical data. 
       
  PBRSU activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $20.1 million   of total unrecog  n  ized compensation cost related to unvested PBRSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.9   years. The fair value of PBRSUs is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. 

17 

Stock Options 
    
  Prior to 2015, we issued stock options as incentive compensation for certain employees. Option activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $0.3 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   6 months  . 
    
  The intrinsic value of options exercised was   $4.4 million   and   $8.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This intrinsic value represents the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of each option. 
    
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  The employee stock purchase plan allows eligible employees to purchase our common stock at   85.0%   of the lesser of the closing price on the first day or the last day of each quarter. Our employee stock purchase plan was approved by our stockholders at our 2012 annual meeting of stockholders and the first offering period commenced in October 2012. We recognized an expense for the amount equal to the estimated fair value of the discount during each offering period. 
    
  The following table sets forth the stock-based compensation expense recognized for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

The above includes   $0.7 million   and   $1.3 million   of stock-based compensation expense within cost of services in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $3.6 million   and   $2.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

18 

Note 11 - Commitments 
    
  Lease Commitments 
    
  We lease certain office facilities, automobiles and equipment under operating leases, which, for the most part, are renewable. The majority of these leases also provide that the Company will pay insurance and taxes. 
    
  Future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

Total rental expenses for all operating leases and month-to-month rentals were   $5.8 million   and   $4.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and   $15.1 million   and   $13.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Operational Commitments 
    
  In August 2011, an affiliate of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation ("Cognizant") acquired CoreLogic India Global Services Private Limited, our India-based captive operations ("CoreLogic India"). The purchase price for CoreLogic India was   $50.0 million   in cash before working capital adjustments. As part of the transaction, we entered into a Master Professional Services Agreement ("Services Agreement") and supplement ("Supplement") with Cognizant under which Cognizant will provide a range of business process and information technology services to us. The Supplement has an initial term of   seven years   and we have the unilateral right to extend the term for up to   three     one  -year periods. During the first   five years   of the agreement, we are subject to a net total minimum commitment of approximately   $303.5 million  , plus applicable inflation adjustments. In connection with the sale, we recorded   $27.1 million   of deferred gain on sale which was recognized to income over   five years  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining minimum commitment totaled   $9.1 million  . 

Note 12   Litigation and Regulatory Contingencies 
    
  We have been named in various lawsuits and we may from time to time be subject to audit or investigation by governmental agencies. Currently, governmental agencies are auditing or investigating certain of our operations. 
    
  With respect to matters where we have determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, we have recorded a liability representing our best estimate of the financial exposure based on known facts. While the ultimate disposition of each such audit, investigation or lawsuit is not yet determinable, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we do not believe there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss exceeding amounts already accrued may be incurred. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management s estimates. We record expenses for legal fees as incurred. 
    
  Separation 
    
  Following the Separation, we are responsible for a portion of FAFC's contingent and other corporate liabilities. In the Separation and Distribution Agreement we entered into in connection with the Separation (the "Separation and Distribution Agreement"), we agreed with FAFC to share equally in the cost of resolution of a small number of corporate-level lawsuits, including certain consolidated securities litigation matters from which we have since been dropped. There were no liabilities incurred in connection with the consolidated securities matters. Responsibility to manage each case has been assigned to either  
  
   19 

FAFC or us, with the managing party required to update the other party regularly and consult with the other party prior to certain important decisions, such as settlement. The managing party will also have primary responsibility for determining the ultimate total liability, if any, related to the applicable case. We will record our share of any such liability when the responsible party determines a reserve is necessary. At   September 30, 2016  ,   no   reserves were considered necessary. 
    
  In addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for cross-indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our predecessor, The First American Corporation's ("FAC") financial services business, with FAFC and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of FAC's information solutions business with us. Specifically, each party will, and will cause its subsidiaries and affiliates to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its respective affiliates and subsidiaries and each of its respective officers, directors, employees and agents for any losses arising out of or otherwise in connection with the liabilities each such party assumed or retained pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement; and any breach by such party of the Separation and Distribution Agreement. 

Note 13   Acquisitions 
    
  In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of FNC for up to   $475.0 million  , with   $400.0 million   in cash paid at closing, subject to certain closing adjustments, and up to   $75.0 million   to be paid in cash in 2018, contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal 2017. We fair-valued the contingent payment using the Monte Carlo simulation model and initially recorded   $8.0 million   as contingent consideration. The contingent payment is fair-valued quarterly and changes are recorded within our condensed consolidated statement of operations. See   Note 9 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments   for further discussion. FNC is a leading provider of real estate collateral information technology and solutions that automates property appraisal ordering, tracking, documentation and review for lender compliance with government regulations and is included as a component of our PI reporting segment. The acquisition continues to expand our property valuation capabilities. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using a variety of valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, which included significant unobservable inputs. The purchase price allocation is subject to change based on our final determination of fair value in connection with intangible assets and working capital matters. We preliminarily recorded a deferred tax liability of   $90.3 million  , property and equipment of   $79.8 million   with an estimated average life of   12 years  , customer lists of   $141.8 million   with an estimated average life of   16 years  , trade names of   $15.9 million   with an estimated average life of   19 years  , non-compete agreements of   $18.8 million   with an estimated average life of   5 years  , other intangibles of   $2.9 million   with an estimated average life of   10 years   and goodwill of   $218.3 million  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , goodwill was increased by approximately   $6.8 million   from the initial amount recorded in the second quarter of 2016, as a results of a change in purchase price allocation for certain working capital and tax adjustments. This business combination did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  In January 2016, we completed the acquisition of the remaining   40%   mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest in PIQ for NZD   $27.8 million  , or   $19.0 million  , and settled the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest. PIQ is included as a component of our PI reporting segment. 
    
  In December 2015, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in RELS for approximately   $65.0 million   and recorded an investment gain of approximately   $34.3 million   due to the step-up in fair value on the previously held   50.1%   interest, which is included in gain on investment and other, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. RELS is included as a component of our PI reporting segment. The acquisition of RELS expands our real estate asset valuation and appraisal solutions in connection with loan originations. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using a variety of valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis, which included significant unobservable inputs. The purchase price allocation is subject to change based on our final determination of fair value in connection with intangible assets and working capital matters. We preliminarily recorded property and equipment of   $27.0 million   with an estimated average life of   10 years  , customer lists of   $48.4 million   with an estimated average life of   10 years  , other intangibles of   $5.0 million   with an estimated average life of   10 years   and goodwill of   $23.1 million  , of which   $11.5 million   is deductible for tax purposes. This business combination did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  In October 2015, we completed the acquisition of Cordell Information Pty Limited ("Cordell") for AUD  $70.0 million  , or   $49.1 million  , subject to working capital adjustments, which is included as a component of our PI reporting segment. The acquisition of Cordell further expands our property information capabilities in Australia. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using a variety of valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, which included significant unobservable inputs. The purchase price allocation is subject to change based on our final determination of fair value in connection with intangible assets and working capital matters. We preliminarily recorded

property and equipment of   $14.3 million   with an estimated average life of   10 years  , customer lists of   $5.5 million   with an estimated average life of   8 years  , trade names of   $0.6 million   with an estimated average life of   4 years   and goodwill of   $31.9 million  , which is fully deductible for tax purposes. This business combination did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  In September 2015, we completed the acquisition of LandSafe Appraisal Services, Inc. for $  122.0 million  , subject to working capital adjustments, which is included as a component of our PI reporting segment. The acquisition builds on our longstanding strategic relationship with a key client and continues to expand our property valuation capabilities. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using a variety of valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, which included significant unobservable inputs. We recorded customer lists of $  53.4 million   with an estimated average life of   10 years  , other intangibles of   $4.3 million   with an estimated average life of   10 years   and goodwill of   $64.6 million  , which is fully deductible for tax purposes. This business combination did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  We incurred   $1.4 million   and   $0.6 million   of acquisition-related costs within selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $7.5 million     and     $1.0 million     for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

Note 14   Discontinued Operations 
    
  In September 2014, we completed the sale of our collateral solutions and field services businesses, which were included in the former reporting segment Asset Management and Processing Solutions ("AMPS"), for total consideration of   $29.1 million  , subject to working capital adjustments. In September 2012, we completed the wind down of our consumer services business and our then-owned appraisal management company business, which were included in our PI and Risk Management and Workflow ("RMW") segments, respectively. In September 2011, we closed our marketing services business, which was included in our PI segment. In December 2010, we completed the sale of our Employer and Litigation Services businesses ("ELI"). Each of these businesses is reflected in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. 
    
  In connection with previous divestitures, we retain the prospect of contingent liabilities for indemnification obligations or breaches of representations or warranties. With respect to one such divestiture, a jury recently returned an unfavorable verdict against a discontinued operating unit that, if upheld on appeal, could result in the reasonable possibility of indemnification exposure up to   $16.0 million  . We do not consider this outcome to be probable and intend to vigorously assert our contractual and other rights, including to pursue an appeal to eliminate or substantially reduce any potential post-divestiture contingency. Any actual liability that comes to fruition would be reflected in our results from discontinued operations. 
    
  Summarized below are certain assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Summarized below are the components of our loss from discontinued operations for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Overview of Business Environment and Company Developments 
    
  Business Environment 
    
  The volume of U.S. mortgage loan originations serves as a key market driver for approximately half of our business. We believe the volume of real estate and mortgage transactions is primarily affected by real estate prices, the availability of funds for mortgage loans, mortgage interest rates, employment levels and the overall state of the U.S. economy. We believe mortgage origination unit volumes increased by approximately 20% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the same period in 2015. Overall, we expect full-year 2016 mortgage unit volumes to be modestly higher than 2015 levels. Longer-term, we expect the mortgage origination market will continue to shift more towards a purchase-driven market, which will partially offset the expected continued decline of refinance activity. 
    
  We generate the majority of our revenues from clients with operations in the U.S. residential real estate, mortgage origination and mortgage servicing markets. Approximately   41.2%   and   30.3%   of our operating revenues for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   41.6%   and   32.7%   of our operating revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were generated from our top ten clients, who consist of the largest U.S. mortgage originators and servicers.   Two   of our clients accounted for   14.6%   and   11.3%   of our operating revenues for the  
  
   26 

three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   14.6%   and   11.5%   of our operating revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.   No   client accounted for   10.0%   or more of our operating revenues for the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  While the majority of our revenues are generated in the U.S., we are impacted by the financial results of our international operations. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our revenues were favorably impacted by   $0.4 million   and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   our revenues were unfavorably impacted by   $3.6 million   due to foreign currency translation.  
    
  Acquisition   Financing 
    
  In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of FNC, Inc. ("FNC"), for up to   $475.0 million  , with   $400.0 million   in cash paid at closing, subject to certain closing adjustments, and up to   $75.0 million   to be paid in 2018 contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal 2017. We funded the transaction primarily by drawing   $390.0 million   on our revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") and also used cash on hand. Subsequently, in July 2016, we completed   $525.0 million   of incremental term loan borrowings by amending our senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") in June 2016. We used a portion of the proceeds of the new borrowings to redeem our outstanding   7.25%   senior notes due 2021 (the "Notes") at a price equal to   103.625%   of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest for approximately   $411.0 million  . We also used a portion of the proceeds to reduce our outstanding balance under the Revolving Facility by   $110.0 million  . 
    
  Unless otherwise indicated, the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate solely to the discussion of our continuing operations.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
    
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Operating Revenues 
    
  Our consolidated operating revenues were   $523.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $137.5 million  , or   35.6%  , when compared to   2015  , and consisted of the following: 

Our PI segment revenues increased by   $123.7 million  , or   78.8%  , when compared to   2015  . Acquisition activity contributed $124.0 million of additional revenues in   2016  . Excluding acquisition activity, the decrease of $0.3 million was due to lower property information and analytics revenues of $2.6 million and lower other revenues of $1.7 million. The variance was partially offset by higher revenues from our international operations of $2.3 million, higher insurance-related revenues of $1.3 million and favorable foreign currency translation of $0.4 million. 
    
  Our RMW segment revenues increased by   $13.7 million  , or   5.9%  , when compared to   2015  . The variance was primarily due to a mix of improved pricing and market-share gains, which increased our revenues from credit   screening solutions by $14.5 million, property tax processing by $8.8 million, and flood data services by $4.0 million, partially offset by declines in our technology solutions revenues from the wind-down of non-core product lines approximately $13.6 million. 
    
  Our corporate and eliminations were comprised of intercompany revenue eliminations between our operating segments. 
    
  Cost of Services 
    
  Our consolidated cost of services was   $275.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $82.6 million  , or   42.8%  , when compared to   2015  . Acquisition activity contributed $82.8 million of additional expense in   2016  . Excluding acquisition activity, the decrease of $0.2 million, despite higher revenues, was due to the result of our on-going operational efficiency programs. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
    
  Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were   $119.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $27.9 million  , or   30.5%  , when compared to   2015  . Acquisition activity contributed $26.2 million of additional expense in   2016  . Excluding acquisition activity, the increase of $1.7 million was primarily due to higher external services costs of $4.4 million (including cyber-security and compliance costs), higher provision for doubtful accounts of $2.4 million and higher facility and lease equipment costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by our on-going operational efficiency programs, which contributed to lower professional fees of $5.2 million and lower compensation-related expenses of $0.6 million. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Our consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was   $44.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $8.1 million  , or   22.1%  , when compared to   2015  . Acquisition activity contributed $10.3 million of additional expense in   2016  . Excluding acquisition activity, the decrease of $2.2 million was due to lower depreciation from assets that were fully depreciated in the prior year. 

28 

Operating Income 
    
  Our consolidated operating income was   $84.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $18.9 million  , or   28.7%  , when compared to   2015  , and consisted of the following: 

Our PI segment operating income increased by   $8.5 million  , or   43.3%  , when compared to   2015  . Acquisition activity contributed $4.7 million of operating income in   2016  . Excluding acquisition activity, operating income increased $3.8 million and operating margins increased 245 basis points primarily due to favorable product mix and pricing in property information and analytics and higher revenues and pricing from our insurance and international operations. 
    
  Our RMW segment operating income increased by   $12.6 million  , or   19.7%  , and operating margins increased 360 basis points when compared to   2015   primarily due to pricing and/or market-share gains in our credit and screening solutions and property tax processing and the impact of ongoing operational efficiency programs, partially offset by the wind-down of non-core product lines. 
    
  Corporate and eliminations had an unfavorable variance of   $2.2 million   primarily due to higher write-offs of leasehold improvements of $1.1 million and higher investments in operational efficiency programs. 
    
  Total Interest Expense, Net 
    
  Our consolidated total interest expense, net was   $13.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.9 million  , or   17.2%  , when compared to   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by a higher average outstanding balance in the current year. The lower interest rates were the result of our financing activities in July 2016 in which we amended and expanded our Credit Agreement and redeemed our Notes. 
    
  Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt and Other, Net 
    
  Our consolidated loss on investments and other, net was   $19.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $17.3 million   when compared to   2015  , due primarily to higher losses related to the extinguishment of debt of $24.4 million in connection with the redemption of all outstanding balances under the Notes. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  Our consolidated provision for income taxes from continuing operations before equity in earnings of affiliates and incomes taxes was   $15.9 million   and   $21.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The effective tax rate was   31.0%   and   46.4%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to current year favorable rate reductions related to foreign tax rate differentials, permanent enactment of the federal research credit subsequent to September 30, 2015 and a reduction in the contingent consideration recorded in connection with the acquisition of FNC. The prior year rate was unfavorably impacted by unbenefited foreign losses in tax jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. and a decrease in foreign tax credits. 
    
  Equity in Earnings of Affiliates, Net of Tax 
    
  Our consolidated equity in earnings of affiliates, net of tax, was   $0.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.9 million  , or   82.6%  , when compared to   2015  . We have equity interests in various affiliates that primarily provide settlement services in connection with residential mortgage loans. The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in RELS in December 2015, which contributed $2.8 million of earnings, net of tax in the third quarter of 2015. Following the acquisition, RELS is a consolidated subsidiary of ours and is no longer accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 

29 

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
    
    Our consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by   $0.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to   2015   due to the acquisition of the remaining   40.0%   interest in New Zealand-based Property IQ Ltd. ("PIQ"). 

Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Operating Revenues 
    
  Our consolidated operating revenues were   $1.5 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $340.4 million  , or   29.9%  , when compared to   2015  , and consisted of the following: 

Our PI segment revenues increased by   $327.3 million  , or   69.4%  , when compared to   2015  . Acquisition activity accounted for $332.7 million of the increase in   2016  . Excluding acquisition activity, the decrease of $5.4 million was primarily due to lower property information and analytics revenues of $7.8 million, the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of $3.6 million and lower other revenues of $3.7 million. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues from our international operations of $6.4 million and higher insurance-related revenues of $3.3 million. 
    
  Our RMW segment revenues increased by   $13.4 million  , or   2.0%  , when compared to   2015  . The variance was primarily due to a mix of improved pricing and market share gains, which increased our revenues from property tax processing by $22.2 million, credit   screening solutions by $17.8 million and flood data services by $5.5 million, partially offset by declines in our technology solutions revenues from the wind-down of non-core product lines of approximately $32.1 million. 
    
  Our corporate and eliminations were comprised of intercompany revenue eliminations between our operating segments. 
    
  Cost of Services 
    
  Our consolidated cost of services was   $785.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $217.5 million  , or   38.3%  , when compared to   2015  . Acquisition activity contributed $222.3 million of additional expense in   2016  . Excluding acquisition activity, the decrease of $4.8 million, despite higher revenues, was primarily due to the result of our on-going operational efficiency programs. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
    
  Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were   $347.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $63.5 million  , or   22.4%  , when compared to   2015  . Acquisition activity contributed $73.2 million of additional expense in   2016  . Excluding acquisition activity, the decrease of $9.7 million was primarily due to our on-going operational efficiency programs which contributed to lower compensation-related expenses of $14.4 million, lower professional fees of $6.6 million and lower facility and lease equipment costs of $1.5 million, partially offset by higher external services costs of $11.9 million (including cyber-security and compliance costs) and higher other costs of $0.9 million. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Our consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was   $127.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $17.7 million  , or   16.2%  , when compared to   2015  . Acquisition activity contributed $24.5 million of additional expense in   2016  . Excluding acquisition activity, the decrease of $6.8 million was due to lower depreciation from assets that were fully depreciated in the prior year. 

30 

Operating Income 
    
  Our consolidated operating income was   $217.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $41.8 million  , or   23.7%  , when compared to   2015  , and consisted of the following: 

Our PI segment operating income increased by   $22.3 million  , or   39.6%  , when compared to   2015  . Acquisition activity contributed $12.7 million of higher operating income in   2016  . Excluding acquisition activity, operating income increased by $9.6 million and operating margins increased 220 basis points primarily due to favorable product mix and pricing in property information and analytics, higher revenues and pricing from our insurance and international operations and the impact of ongoing operational efficiency programs. 
    
  Our RMW segment operating income increased by   $16.0 million  , or   8.9%  , and operating margins increased 181 basis points when compared to   2015   primarily due to improved pricing and/or market share gains and the impact of ongoing operational efficiency programs, partially offset by  the wind-down of non-core product lines. 
    
  Corporate and eliminations operating loss decreased   $3.5 million  , or   5.8%  , primarily due to the impact of ongoing operational efficiency programs. 
    
  Total Interest Expense, net 
    
  Our consolidated total interest expense, net was   $45.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $0.3 million  , or   0.7%  , when compared to   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by a higher average outstanding balance and an out-of-period adjustment which reduced interest expense by $5.2 million during the first quarter of 2015. The lower interest rates were the result of our financing activities in July 2016 in which we amended and expanded our Credit Agreement and redeemed our Notes. 
    
  Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt and Other, Net 
    
  Our consolidated loss on investments and other, net was   $17.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $13.6 million   when compared to   2015  , due primarily to the extinguishment of debt of $24.4 million in connection with the redemption of all outstanding balances under the Notes, partially offset by higher realized gains on investments in the current year of $6.6 million. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  Our consolidated provision for income taxes from continuing operations before equity in earnings of affiliates and income taxes was   $52.0 million   and   $47.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The effective tax rate was   33.5%   and   37.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to current year favorable rate reductions related to foreign tax rate differentials, permanent enactment of the federal research credit subsequent to September 30, 2015 and a reduction in the contingent consideration recorded in connection with the acquisition of FNC. The current year favorable rate reductions were partially offset by prior year non-recurring favorable discrete items related to release of a foreign valuation allowance and a reduction in foreign uncertain tax benefits due to statute of limitations expiration. 
    
  Equity in Earnings of Affiliates, Net of Tax 
    
  Our consolidated equity in earnings of affiliates, net of tax, decreased   $11.3 million  , or   95.0%  , when compared to   2015  . We have equity interests in various affiliates that primarily provide settlement services in connection with residential mortgage loans. The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in RELS in December 2015, which  
  
   31 

contributed $10.0 million of earnings, net of tax in 2015. Following the acquisition, RELS is a consolidated subsidiary of ours and is no longer accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  
    
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
    
    Our consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by   $0.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to   2015   due to the acquisition of the remaining   40.0%   interest in PIQ.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   totaled   $79.0 million  , a decrease of   $20.1 million   from   December 31, 2015  . Our cash balances held outside of the U.S. are primarily related to our international operations and, as of   September 30, 2016  , totaled $29.1 million. Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. We plan to maintain significant cash balances outside the U.S. for the foreseeable future. 
    
  Restricted cash of   $8.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $10.9 million   as of   December 31, 2015   represents cash pledged for various letters of credit provided in the ordinary course of business to certain vendors, including in connection with obtaining insurance and real property leases. 
    
  Cash Flow 
    
  Operating Activities.   Cash provided by operating activities reflects net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Total cash provided by operating activities was approximately   $316.8 million   and   $252.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to cash generated from higher profitability, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital items. 
    
  Investing Activities.   Total cash used in investing activities was approximately   $476.1 million   and   $179.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in investing activities is primarily related to net cash paid for acquisitions, including $394.8 million for FNC and an acquisition that was not significant for $2.0 million compared to the cash paid for the acquisition of LandSafe Appraisal Services, Inc. of $119.3 million in the prior year. We also acquired the remaining   40.0%   interest in PIQ for   $18.0 million   in 2016. Further, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had investments in property and equipment of   $35.2 million   and   $30.0 million  , respectively, and capitalized data and other intangible assets of   $27.2 million   and   $27.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  Financing Activities.   Total cash provided by financing activities was approximately   $140.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was primarily comprised of proceeds from debt issuance of   $915.0 million   and net proceeds from stock-based compensation-related transactions of   $5.9 million  , partially offset by repayment of long-term debt of   $647.3 million  , share repurchases of   $113.0 million  , debt issuance costs of   $6.3 million   and premium on debt extinguishment of   $14.2 million  . Total cash used in financing activities was   $25.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily comprised of share repurchases of   $97.4 million  , repayment of long-term debt of   $47.0 million   and debt issuance costs of   $6.5 million  , partially offset by proceeds from debt issuance of   $114.4 million   and net proceeds from stock-based compensation-related transactions of   $11.4 million  . 
    
  Financing and Financing Capacity 
    
  Total debt outstanding, gross, was   $1.6 billion   and   $1.4 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Our significant debt instruments and borrowing capacity are described below. 
    
  Senior Notes 
    
  In May 2011, we issued   $400.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the Notes. In July 2016, we completed the redemption of all outstanding balances under the Notes, which included a premium on debt extinguishment payment in the amount of   $14.2 million  . 

32 

Credit Agreement 
    
  For a detailed description of our Credit Agreement, see   Note 6 - Long-Term Debt   of our condensed consolidated financial statements. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility of   $295.0 million   and were in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants of the Credit Agreement. 
    
  Interest Rate Swaps 
    
  We have entered into amortizing interest rate swaps ("Swaps") in order to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure on the Term Facility floating rate borrowings from variable to fixed. In August 2016, we entered into Swaps which became effective in September 2016 and terminate in April 2020. The Swaps entered in August 2016 are for an initial notional balance of   $500.0 million  , with a fixed interest rate of   1.03%  , and amortize quarterly by   $25.0 million   through December 2018, with a notional step up of   $100.0 million   in March 2019, continued quarterly amortization of   $25.0 million   through April 2020, and a remaining notional amount of   $275.0 million  . In May 2014, we entered into Swaps which became effective in December 2014 and terminate in March 2019. The Swaps entered in May 2014 are for an initial notional balance of   $500.0 million  , with a fixed interest rate of   1.57%  , and amortize quarterly by   $12.5 million   through December 31, 2017 and   $25.0 million   through December 31, 2018, with a remaining notional amount of   $250.0 million  .  
    
  Liquidity and Capital Strategy 
    
  We believe that cash flow from operations and current cash balances, together with currently available lines of credit, will be sufficient to meet operating requirements through the next twelve months. Cash available from operations could be affected by any general economic downturn or any decline or adverse changes in our business such as a loss of clients, competitive pressures or other significant change in business environment. 
    
  We strive to pursue a balanced approach to capital allocation and will consider the repurchase of common shares, the retirement of outstanding debt and the pursuit of strategic acquisitions on an opportunistic basis. 
    
  Availability of Additional Capital 
    
  Our access to additional capital fluctuates as market conditions change. There may be times when the private capital markets and the public debt or equity markets lack sufficient liquidity or when our securities cannot be sold at attractive prices, in which case we would not be able to access capital from these sources. Based on current market conditions and our financial condition (including our ability to satisfy the conditions contained in our debt instruments that are required to be satisfied to permit us to incur additional indebtedness), we believe that we have the ability to effectively access these liquidity sources for capital or new borrowings. However, a weakening of our financial condition, including a significant decrease in our profitability or cash flows or a material increase in our leverage, could adversely affect our ability to access these markets and/or increase our cost of borrowings.  

33 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  A summary, by due date, of our total contractual obligations at   September 30, 2016  , is as follows: 

(1) 
    Estimated interest payments are calculated assuming current interest rates over minimum maturity periods specified in debt agreements. 
              (2) 
    Net minimum commitment with Cognizant. 
              (3) 
    Excludes a net liability of   $12.9 million   related to uncertain tax positions including associated interest and penalties, and deferred compensation of   $34.0 million   due to uncertainty of payment period. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  For additional information with respect to our critical accounting policies, which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management, see Item 7,    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ,  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there had been no material changes to this information. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
    
  Our primary exposure to market risk relates to interest-rate risk associated with certain financial instruments. We monitor our risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge some of these risks. We have entered into Swaps in order to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure on the Term Facility floating rate borrowings from variable to fixed. In August 2016, we entered into Swaps which became effective in September 2016 and terminate in April 2020. The Swaps entered in August 2016 are for an initial notional balance of   $500.0 million  , with a fixed interest rate of   1.03%  , and amortize quarterly by   $25.0 million   through December 2018, with a notional step up of   $100.0 million   in March 2019, continued quarterly amortization of   $25.0 million   through April 2020, and a remaining notional amount of   $275.0 million  . In May 2014, we entered into Swaps which became effective in December 2014 and terminate in March 2019. The Swaps entered in May 2014 are for an initial notional balance of   $500.0 million  , with a fixed interest rate of   1.57%  , and amortize quarterly by   $12.5 million   through December 31, 2017 and   $25.0 million   through December 31, 2018, with a remaining notional amount of   $250.0 million  . We entered into the Swaps in order to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure on the Term Facility floating rate borrowings from variable to fixed. We have designated the Swaps as cash flow hedges. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $1.6 billion   in gross long-term debt outstanding with variable-interest-rate debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining notional balance of the Swaps was   $912.5 million  . A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates could result in an approximately   $1.6 million   change to interest expense on a quarterly basis. 
    
  Although we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of our operations in certain foreign countries, the foreign exchange exposure related to these operations, in the aggregate, is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. 

34 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, were effective, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(b). 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item  1.  Legal Proceedings. 
    
  For a description of our legal proceedings, see   Note 12   Litigation and Regulatory Contingencies   of our condensed consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference in response to this item. 

Item  1A.  Risk Factors. 
    
  A restated description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. This description supersedes the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but do represent those risks that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements under the heading  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   
    
  Risks Related to Our Business 
    
           1. 
    We depend on our ability to access data from external sources to maintain and grow our businesses. If we are unable to access needed data from these sources or if the prices charged for these services increase, the quality, pricing and availability of our products and services may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
       
  We rely extensively upon data from a variety of external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data from third-party suppliers, various government and public record sources and data contributed by our clients. Our data sources could cease providing or reduce the availability of their data to us, increase the price we pay for their data, or limit our use of their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use. If a number of suppliers are no longer able or are unwilling to provide us with certain data, or if our public record sources of data become unavailable or too expensive, we may need to find alternative sources. If we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and efficiently and effectively integrate these data sources into our service offerings, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs and reduced quality of our services. Moreover, some of our suppliers compete with us in certain product offerings, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases from them.  Significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins and our financial position, in particular if we are unable to arrange for substitute sources of data on favorable economic terms. Loss of such access or the availability of data in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all may reduce the quality and availability of our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
    
           2. 
    Our clients and we are subject to various governmental regulations, and a failure to comply with government regulations or changes in these regulations could result in penalties, restrict or limit our or our clients' operations or make it more burdensome to conduct such operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. 
       
  Many of our and our clients' businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to provide certain services or result in the  
  
   35 

imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties, substantial regulatory and compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity and loss of revenue.   
    
  In addition, our businesses are subject to an increasing degree of compliance oversight by regulators and by our clients. Specifically, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") has authority to write rules affecting the business of credit reporting agencies and also to supervise, conduct examinations of, and enforce compliance as to federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations with respect to certain  non-depository covered persons  determined by the CFPB to be  larger participants  that offer consumer financial products and services. Two of our credit businesses - CoreLogic Credco and Teletrack - are subject to the CFPB non-bank supervision program. The CFPB and the prudential financial institution regulators such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") also have the authority to examine us in our role as a service provider to large financial institutions, although it is yet unclear how broadly they will apply this authority going forward. In addition, several of our largest bank clients are subject to consent orders with the OCC and/or are parties to the National Mortgage Settlement, both of which require them to exercise greater oversight and perform more rigorous audits of their key vendors such as us. 
    
  These laws and regulations (as well as laws and regulations in the various states or in other countries) could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in, impose additional costs or restrictions on us, result in significant loss of revenue, impact the value of assets we hold, or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business. In addition, this increased level of scrutiny may increase our compliance costs. 
    
  Our operations could be negatively affected by changes to laws and regulations and enhanced regulatory oversight of our clients and us. These changes may compel us to increase our prices in certain situations or decrease our prices in other situations, may restrict our ability to implement price increases, and may limit the manner in which we conduct our business or otherwise may have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues, earnings and cash flows. If we are unable to adapt our products and services to conform to the new laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations have a negative impact on our clients, we may experience client losses or increased operating costs, and our business and results of operations could be negatively affected. 
    
           3. 
    Regulatory developments with respect to use of consumer data and public records could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
       
    Because our databases include certain public and non-public personal information concerning consumers, we are subject to government regulation and potential adverse publicity concerning our use of consumer data. We acquire, store, use and provide many types of consumer data and related services that are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
   ("FCRA"), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA"), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act and, to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of consumers and to prevent the unauthorized access and misuse of personal information in the marketplace. Our failure to comply with these laws, or any future laws or regulations of a similar nature, could result in substantial regulatory penalties, litigation expense and loss of revenue. 
    
  In addition, some of our data suppliers face similar regulatory requirements and, consequently, they may cease to be able to provide data to us or may substantially increase the fees they charge us for this data which may make it financially burdensome or impossible for us to acquire data that is necessary to offer our products and services. Further, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy or ensure the accuracy of consumer-related data. As a result, they are seeking further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors as well as contemplating requirements relative to data accuracy and the ability of consumers to opt to have their personal data removed from databases such as ours. Any future laws, regulations or other restrictions limiting the dissemination or use of personal information may reduce the quality and availability of our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
           4. 
    If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or if we are unable to provide adequate security in the electronic transmission of sensitive data, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
       
  We are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for business-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Security breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or  
  
   36 

electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information and consumer data. Unauthorized access, including through use of fraudulent schemes such as "phishing" schemes, could jeopardize the security of information stored in our systems. In addition, malware or viruses could jeopardize the security of information stored or used in a user's computer. If we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss, lawsuits and other regulatory imposed restrictions and penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive consumer data. 
    
  Likewise, our clients are increasingly imposing more stringent contractual obligations on us relating to our information security protections. If we are unable to maintain protections and processes at a level commensurate with that required by our clients, it could negatively affect our relationships with those clients or increase our operating costs, which could harm our business or reputation. 
    
           5. 
    We rely on our top ten clients for a significant portion of our revenue and profit, which makes us susceptible to the same macro-economic and regulatory factors that our clients face. If these clients are negatively impacted by current economic or regulatory conditions or otherwise experience financial hardship or stress, or if the terms of our relationships with these clients change, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
       
  Our ten largest clients generated approximately   41.2%   of our operating revenues for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , and two of our largest clients each generated over 10% of our revenue in the   third   quarter of 2016. We expect that a limited number of our clients will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future, and that our concentration of revenue with one or more clients may continue to be significant or increase. These clients face continued pressure in the current economic and regulatory climate. Many of our relationships with these clients are long-standing and are important to our future operating results, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements or maintain our relationships on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, in response to increased regulatory oversight, clients in the mortgage lending industry may have internal policies that require them to use multiple vendors or service providers, thereby causing a diversification of revenue among many vendors. Deterioration in or termination of any of these relationships, including through vendor diversification policies or merger or consolidation among our clients, could significantly reduce our revenue and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of our businesses have higher client concentration than our company as a whole. As a result, these businesses may be disproportionately affected by declining revenue from, or loss of, a significant client. 
    
           6. 
    Systems interruptions may impair the delivery of our products and services, causing potential client and revenue loss. 
       
    System interruptions may impair the delivery of our products and services, resulting in a loss of clients and a corresponding loss in revenue. Our technology infrastructure runs primarily in a private dedicated cloud-based environment hosted in Dell's technology center in Quincy, WA. We cannot be sure that certain systems interruptions or events beyond our control, including issues with Dell's technology center or our third-party network and infrastructure providers, will not interrupt or terminate the delivery of our products and services to our clients. These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers' ability to provide necessary data to us and our employees' ability to attend to work and perform their responsibilities. Any of these possible outcomes could result in a loss of clients or a loss in revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business or operations. 
    
           7. 
    Because     our revenue from clients in the mortgage, consumer lending and real estate industries is affected by the strength of the economy and the housing market generally, including the volume of real estate transactions, a negative change in any of these conditions could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
       
  A significant portion of our revenue is generated from solutions we provide to the mortgage, consumer lending and real estate industries and, as a result, a weak economy or housing market or adverse changes in the interest rate environment may adversely affect our business. The volume of mortgage origination and residential real estate transactions is highly variable. Reductions in these transaction volumes could have a direct impact on certain portions of our revenues and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, negative economic conditions and/or increasing interest rate environments could affect the performance and financial condition of some of our clients in many of our businesses, which may lead to negative impacts on our revenue, earnings and liquidity in particular if these clients go bankrupt or otherwise exit certain businesses.  
  
   37 

8. 
    Our acquisition and integration of businesses by us may involve increased expenses, and may not produce the desired financial or operating results contemplated at the time of the transaction. 
       
  We have acquired and expect to continue to acquire, on an opportunistic basis, companies, businesses, products and services. These activities may increase our expenses, and the expected benefits, synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned. In addition, we may have difficulty integrating our completed or any future acquisitions into our operations, including implementing at the acquired companies controls, procedures and policies in line with our controls, procedures and policies. If we fail to properly integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies and personnel, it could impair relationships with employees, clients and strategic partners, distract management attention from our core businesses, result in control failures and otherwise disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. We also may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition. Although part of our business strategy may include growth through strategic acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, obtain the capital necessary to pursue acquisitions or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms.  
    
           9. 
    Our reliance on outsourcing arrangements subjects us to risk and may disrupt or adversely affect our operations. In addition, we may not realize the full benefit of our outsourcing arrangements, which may result in increased costs, or may adversely affect our service levels for our clients. 
       
    Over the last few years, we have outsourced various business process and information technology services to third parties, including the outsourcing arrangements we entered into with a subsidiary of Cognizant Technology Solutions and the technology infrastructure management services agreement we entered into with Dell. Although we have service-level arrangements with our providers, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable to their performance failures. In addition, the failure to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third-party vendors could subject us to additional risk. Reliance on third parties also makes us vulnerable to changes in the vendors' business, financial condition and other matters outside of our control, including their violations of laws or regulations which could increase our exposure to liability or otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of our business. The failure of our outsourcing partners to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations and to the services we provide to our clients, which could materially and adversely affect our business, client relationships, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.  
       
           10. 
    Our international service providers and our own international operations subject us to additional risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and may impair our ability to operate effectively. 
       
    Over the last few years, we have reduced our costs by utilizing lower-cost labor outside the U.S. in countries such as India and the Philippines through outsourcing arrangements. These countries are subject to higher degrees of political and social instability than the U.S. and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. Such disruptions can impact our ability to deliver our products and services on a timely basis, if at all, and to a lesser extent can decrease efficiency and increase our costs. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies used and higher inflation rates experienced in these countries may also reduce the savings we planned to achieve. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has come under increased scrutiny in the United States and, as a result, many of our clients may require us to use labor based in the U.S. We may not be able to pass on the increased costs of higher-priced U.S.-based labor to our clients, which ultimately could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
    
  In addition, the foreign countries in which we have service provider arrangements or operate could adopt new legislation or regulations that would adversely affect our business by making it difficult, more costly or impossible for us to continue our foreign activities as currently being conducted. Furthermore, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). Any violations of FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions. 
    
           11. 
    We rely upon proprietary technology and information rights, and if we are unable to protect our rights, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. 
       
  Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying, distribution and creation of derivative products to protect our proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and our  
  
   38 

intellectual property could be used by others without our consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
           12. 
    If our products or services are found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties. 
       
  As we continue to develop and expand our products and services, we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims from third parties such as non-practicing entities, software providers or suppliers of data. Likewise, if we are unable to maintain adequate controls over how third-party software and data are used we may be subject to claims of infringement. Any claims, whether with or without merit, could: 

be expensive and time-consuming to defend; 
                
    cause us to cease making, licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 
                
    require us to redesign our applications, if feasible; 
                
    divert management's attention and resources; and 
                
    require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. 
       
           13. 
    Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from complying with our covenants and obligations under our outstanding debt instruments. Further, the instruments governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that could limit our operating flexibility. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total debt was approximately   $1.6 billion  , and we had unused commitments of approximately   $295.0 million   under our Revolving Facility. In July 2016, we completed   $525.0 million   of incremental term loan borrowings through an amendment to our Credit Agreement. A portion of the proceeds of the new borrowings were used to complete the redemption of all outstanding balances under the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest for approximately   $411.0 million  . The remaining portion of the proceeds were utilized to reduce our outstanding balance within the Revolving Facility. 
    
  Subject to the limitations contained in the Credit Agreement governing our credit facilities and our other debt instruments, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other general corporate purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could increase. Specifically, our level of debt could have important consequences to us, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and compromising our flexibility to capitalize our business opportunities and to plan for, or react to, competitive pressures and changes in our business or market conditions. 
    
  The Credit Agreement governing our credit facilities imposes operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions include the financial covenants in our credit facilities which require ongoing compliance with certain financial tests and ratios, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio, and could limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things: 

create, incur or assume additional debt; 
                
    create, incur or assume certain liens; 
                
    redeem and/or prepay certain subordinated debt we might issue in the future; 
                
    pay dividends on our stock or repurchase stock; 
                
    make certain investments and acquisitions, including joint ventures; 
                
    enter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; 
                
    enter into new lines of business; 
                
    engage in consolidations, mergers and acquisitions; 
                
    engage in specified sales of assets; and 
                
    enter into transactions with affiliates. 
       
  These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could impact our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us. Our failure to comply with these restrictions could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all our debt. 
  
   39 

14.    We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt instruments, which may not be successful. 
    
  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facilities could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and could terminate their revolving commitments to loan money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
    
  15.    We operate in a competitive business environment, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
    
  The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. We compete for existing and new clients against both third parties and the in-house capabilities of our clients. Many of our competitors have substantial resources. Some have widely-used technology platforms that they seek to use as a competitive advantage to drive sales of other products and services. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. These competitors and new technologies may be disruptive to our existing technology or service offerings, resulting in operating inefficiencies and increased competitive pressure. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. Any competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
           16. 
    We may not be able to attract and retain qualified management or develop current management to assist in or lead company growth, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain or expand our product and service offerings. 
       
  We rely on skilled management and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of such individuals. If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. We compete for talented individuals not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of individuals who have the skills and training needed to grow our company, especially in the increasingly-regulated environment in which we operate. Increased attrition or competition for qualified management could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and product offerings, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. 
    
           17. 
    We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions and an impairment of these investments would require a write-down that would reduce our net income. 
       
  Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually or sooner if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends. In the event that the book value of goodwill is impaired, any such impairment would be charged to earnings in the period of impairment. In the event of significant volatility in the capital markets or a worsening of current economic conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Possible future impairment of goodwill may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  18.    We may not be able to effectively achieve our cost-containment or growth strategies, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.   
    
  Our ability to execute on our cost-containment and growth strategies depends in part on maintaining our competitive advantage with current solutions in new and existing markets, as well as our ability to develop new technologies and solutions to serve such markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to realize all of the projected benefits of our cost-containment plans or that we will be able to compete successfully in new markets or continue to compete effectively in our existing markets. In addition, development of new technologies and solutions may require significant investment by us.  If we fail to introduce new technologies or solutions on a cost-effective or timely basis, or if we are not successful in introducing or  
  
   40 

obtaining regulatory or market acceptance for new solutions, we may lose market share and our results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. 
    
           19. 
    We share responsibility with First American Financial Corporation ("FAFC") for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the Separation. 
       
  Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, by and between FAC and FAFC, dated as of June 1, 2010 (the "Tax Sharing Agreement") we entered into in connection with the Separation transaction, we are generally responsible for taxes attributable to our business, assets and liabilities and FAFC is generally responsible for all taxes attributable to members of the FAFC group of companies and the assets, liabilities or businesses of the FAFC group of companies. Generally, any liabilities arising from tax adjustments to consolidated tax returns for tax periods prior to and including the date of the Separation will be shared in proportion to each company's percentage of the tax liability for the relevant year (or partial year with respect to 2010), unless the adjustment is attributable to either party, in which case the adjustment will generally be for the account of such party. In addition to this potential liability associated with adjustments for prior periods, if FAFC were to fail to pay any tax liability it is required to pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such tax liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of tax liabilities. 
    
           20. 
    If certain transactions, including internal transactions, undertaken in anticipation of the Separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and FAFC will incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. 
       
  In connection with the Separation we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to the effect that, among other things, certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Separation will qualify for favorable treatment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the   Code  ), and the contribution by us of certain assets of the financial services businesses to FAFC and the pro-rata distribution to our shareholders of the common stock of FAFC will, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition, we received opinions of tax counsel to similar effect. The ruling and opinions relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and FAFC regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the Separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that were not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or FAFC after the Separation. If the Separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, we and our stockholders that are subject to income tax could incur significant income tax liabilities. 
    
  In addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event a transaction were determined to be taxable and such determination were the result of actions taken after the Separation by us or FAFC, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or FAFC as a result thereof.  
    
  Moreover, the Tax Sharing Agreement generally provides that each party thereto is responsible for any taxes imposed on the other party as a result of the failure of the distribution to qualify as a tax-free transaction under the Code if such failure is attributable to post-Separation actions taken by or in respect of the responsible party or its stockholders, regardless of when the actions occur after the Separation, and the other party consents to such actions or such party obtains a favorable letter ruling or opinion of tax counsel as described above.  
    
           21. 
    In connection with the Separation, we entered into a number of agreements with FAFC setting forth rights and obligations of the parties post-Separation. In addition, certain provisions of these agreements provide protection to FAFC in the event of a change of control of us, which could reduce the likelihood of a potential change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable. 
       
  In connection with the Separation, we and FAFC entered into a number of agreements that set forth certain rights and obligations of the parties post-Separation, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement and the Restrictive Covenants Agreement. We possess certain rights under those agreements, including without limitation indemnity rights from certain liabilities allocated to FAFC. The failure of FAFC to perform its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  
   41 

In addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement gives FAFC the right to purchase the equity or assets of our entity or entities directly or indirectly owning the real property databases that we currently own upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. The triggering events include the direct or indirect purchase of the databases by a title insurance underwriter (or its affiliate) or an entity licensed as a title insurance underwriter, including a transaction where a title insurance underwriter (or its affiliate) acquires 25% or more of us. The purchase right expires June 1, 2020. Until the expiration of the purchase right, this provision could have the effect of limiting or discouraging an acquisition of us or preventing a change of control that our stockholders might consider favorable. Likewise, if a triggering event occurs, the loss of ownership of our real property database could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
    
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
    
  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not issue any unregistered shares of our common stock. 
    
  Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
    
  On July 31, 2015, the Board of Directors canceled all prior repurchase authorizations and established a new share repurchase authorization of up to $350.0 million. The new share repurchase authorization replaces the unused portion of our previous share repurchase authorization, which was announced in December 2013. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $198.3 million   in value of shares remaining that could be purchased in the future under the current authorization. The stock repurchase authorization has no expiration date and repurchases may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or under a Rule 10b5-1 plan. 
    
  Under our Credit Agreement, our stock repurchase capacity is restricted to $150.0 million per fiscal year, with the ability to undertake an additional amount of repurchases in such fiscal year provided that, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the stock repurchase, our total leverage ratio does not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. While we continue to preserve the capacity to execute share repurchases under our existing share repurchase authorization, going forward we will strive to pursue a balanced approach to capital allocation and will consider the repurchase of shares of our common shares, the retirement of outstanding debt and the pursuit of strategic acquisitions on an opportunistic basis.

           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of CoreLogic, Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;
