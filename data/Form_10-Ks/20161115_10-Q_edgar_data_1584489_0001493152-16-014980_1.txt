STATEMENTS   

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects. Words such as  expects,   anticipates,   intends,   plans,   believes, 
 seeks,   estimates  and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identify forward-looking
statements, but are not deemed to represent an all-inclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements as denoted in this

anticipated by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes
include, without limitation, those specifically addressed in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations  in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed on April
14, 2016, in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in this
quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).
You are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q.  

We
undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that
may arise after the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, except as required by law. Readers are urged to carefully review

Note
1 - Organization and Operations   

House
of BODS Fitness, Inc. (the  Company,   HOB,   we,   our,  or  us )
was incorporated in Delaware on October 13, 2010. We acquired BODS Transcending Company, Inc. ( BODT ) on October
21, 2010. BODT was incorporated in the state of Florida on September 11, 2007 and was terminated on September 26, 2014. In 2014,
the Company determined that it no longer needed to continue to operate through a subsidiary and all of its operations were transferred
to Company.  

The
dance studio opened for business in 2007, and, in the years since 2007, we have provided a fitness program for over 5,000 clients.
Our fitness program, created for women, works out  body and mind  elevating the sprit, while burning calories. Our
new approach to exercise is to make exercise fun through dance, TRX training, and kickboxing, which takes the bore and lack of
motivation out of traditional exercising. Our program creates a style of exercising that captivates our clients in such a way
that it keeps them moving, while benefiting from the exercise. Our initial dance studio closed in November of 2013. During the
first quarter 2016, we opened a new studio in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  

Note
2   Going Concern   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
of business.  

As
reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at September
30, 2016 of $485,597, a net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $31,157 and $98,746, respectively,
and net cash used in operating activities of $74,326 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company is attempting to produce sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support
its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to produce sufficient revenue and in its ability
to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise
additional funds.  

The
audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm, dated April 13, 2016, included an explanatory paragraph about
the existence of substantial doubt concerning the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.  

Note
3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

The
Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness
of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important
to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult, subjective,
or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below.  

Basis
of presentation- Unaudited Interim Financial Information    

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary BODT,
through September 26, 2014. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Note
3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, and the results of operations
for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the statement of shareholders  deficit for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and the statements of cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
The condensed consolidated results of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the entire year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived
from the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain prior year balances may have
been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. While management of the Company believes that the disclosures
presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016.  

Through
the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2014, the Company had reported under the guidance
of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 915 , Development Stage Entities . FASB Accounting Standards
Update No. 2014-10 , Developments Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including
an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation,  eliminated the concept of Development Stage
Entities and became effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and
interim periods therein. Accordingly, the Company has ceased reporting as a Development Stage Entity.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable
and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has
been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability
is reasonably assured. In addition to the aforementioned general policy, the following is the specific revenue recognition policy:  

Revenues
from the sale of our exercise, dance and training programs is recognized when:  

Persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists;   

The
    dance or exercise session has been completed in accordance with the terms of the arrangement;   

The
    price, generally per session, to the customer is fixed and determinable; and   

Collectability
    is reasonably assured.   

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period(s).  

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact
of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company s critical accounting estimates
and assumptions affecting the financial statements were:  

(i)
Assumption as a going concern : Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business;  

(ii)
Fair value of long-lived assets : Fair value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash
flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined
remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated
over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators
at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.

3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued   

(iii)
Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets : Management assumes that the realization of the Company s net deferred tax
assets resulting from its net operating loss ( NOL ) carry forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may
be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of
the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company
has incurred recurring losses, (b) general economic conditions, and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily
operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.  

(iv)
Estimates and assumptions used in valuation of equity instruments:  Significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the
risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates
or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.  

Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  

Management
regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes
in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those
estimates are adjusted accordingly.  

Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  

Concentration
and Credit Risk    

Financial
instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash,
cash equivalents and, when present, trade receivables. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with high credit
quality institutions. At times, such investments may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

FASB
ASC 820  Fair Value Measurements  establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of financial instruments and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related
disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value into three (3) broad levels. The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined are as follows:  

Level
    1  
      Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level
    2  
      Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.   

Level
    3  
      Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses,
accounts payable and accrued interest   related party, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of
competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply
that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arms-length transactions unless
such representations can be substantiated.  

Carrying
Value, Recoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets    

The
Company has adopted ASC 360  Property, Plant and Equipment  for its long-lived assets. The Company s long-lived
assets, which include furniture, fixtures and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  

The
Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated
with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective
carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair
value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.
If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than
originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated
useful lives.  

The
Company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence
of such events. There were no impairment charges recognized for the three month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Cash
Equivalents    

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  

Property
and Equipment    

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs
are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking
into account their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful lives of five (5) to seven (7) years.
Upon sale or retirement of property or equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any gain or loss is reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

Derivative
Instruments    

The
Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815,  Derivatives and Hedging
( ASC 815 ),  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. They require that an entity recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.  

If
certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge, the objective of which is to match the timing
of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of (i) the changes in the fair value of the hedged
asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction.
For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change.  

The
Company has not engaged in any derivative transactions or hedging activities during the nine month periods ending September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Related
Parties    

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 850  Related Party Transactions   Disclosures  relating to the identification
of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.  

Our
financial statements include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense
allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. The disclosures include: (a) the nature of the relationship(s)
involved; (b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed,
for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding
of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; (c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods
for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used
in the preceding period; and (d) amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if
not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.

and Contingencies    

The
Company follows the guidance of ASC 450  Contingencies  when accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist
as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only
be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such
assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that may
be pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived
merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought therein.

Note
3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued   

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.
If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable
but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable
and material, would be disclosed.  

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would
be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time, that these matters will have a material
adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is
no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial position, and
results of operations or cash flows.  

Equity
Instruments Issued to Parties Other Than Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services    

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under guidance
of ASC 505-50.  

Accordingly,
all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted
for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more
reliably measurable. The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the
date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.  

Deferred
Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision    

The
Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the financial statements or tax returns pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740  Income Taxes . Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  

Net
Income (Loss) per Common Share    

Basic
net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period
to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements such as stock
options, convertible note shares and warrants.  

For
the three and nine month reporting periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had 1,600,000 and 433,333 potentially
dilutive shares underlying convertible notes outstanding, respectively, which were not included in our income (loss) per share
calculations as they were anti-dilutive.  

Subsequent
Events    

The
Company will evaluate and disclose if indicated, subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued.
Pursuant to ASU 2010-09, the Company, as an SEC filer, considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed
to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.  

Accounting
Standards Update    

Management
believes that recently issued standards, both effective and not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company s
financial statements upon adoption.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Overview   

House
of Bods, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware on October 13, 2010. Our business operations were originally conducted
under a wholly owned subsidiary, BODS Transcending Company (BODT), which was incorporated in the state of Florida on September
11, 2007. BODT was terminated on September 26, 2014 after the Company determined that it no longer needed to continue to operate
through a subsidiary and transferred all of its operations to House of Bods Fitness, Inc.  

Our
founder and Chief Executive Officer, Tammy Skalko, is our only full-time employee, and we currently have no part-time employees
or contracted dance/fitness instructors. Ms. Skalko has recently developed her own dance fitness program, which has become very
popular with our clients since she began teaching the program. Our fitness program, created for women, works out  body and
mind,  elevating the spirit while burning calories. The mantra of  anything is possible if you believe baby 
runs through the program and  sweat yourself sexy  is one of the many tenets of the fun dance sessions encompassing
our fitness program. Our new approach to exercise, making exercise fun through dance, TRX training, and kickboxing, takes the
bore and lack of motivation out of traditional exercising and entices the audience with flirty, fun and sexy moves that keep them
wanting more. Our program creates a style of exercise that captivates our participants in such a way that it keeps them moving.
Our  fun  atmosphere motivates the individual to keep going, while benefiting from the exercise. Ms. Skalko, our CEO,
has personally found that the House of BODS Fitness program has helped her maintain her figure and given her the energy required
to run a business and raise her children.  

The
Company has recently focused on training and business development and during the first quarter of 2016 opened a dance studio in
Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Ms. Skalko continues to provide clients with private training sessions in their homes. These clients
each average two sessions per week at $20-$25 per session. The Company counts a client as any individual who has purchased at
least one class or personal training session. The Company is currently looking for a suitable site to lease or purchase to resume
dance classes and training sessions. After reviewing some major markets in Atlanta, LA, Toronto, Daytona Beach and Austin, TX,
the Company has settled its search for an appropriate facility to the South Florida regions, including Boca Raton, West Palm Beach
and/or Ft. Lauderdale as the most promising. These areas combine the Company s need for affordable space together with demographics
most likely to desire the Company s unique brand of fitness (among other things: disposable income and openness towards
trendy, sexy, dancing.). The Company will be focusing their efforts over the coming year to acquiring an acceptable facility and
reinstituting classes.  

Recent
Developments   

None.  

Results
of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015   

The
Company is still in its formative stages with minimal sales and operations. A summary of operations for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is as follows:  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $98,746. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital
deficit of $85,138. In view of these matters, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
Company s ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. The Company intends on financing its future
development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding
from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations, if ever, are
sufficient to fund working capital requirements.  

As
previously mentioned, since inception, we have financed our operations largely from the sale of common stock and the issuance
of notes payable. During the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 we did not raise any funds from the sale of common stock.
During this period, we raised $60,000 through the issuance of notes payable to related parties, the majority of which is being
used to cover operating expenses and professional services.  

We
have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of September 30, 2016, we
had an accumulated deficit of $485,597.  

We
anticipate that cash used in product development and operations, especially in the marketing, production and sale of our products,
may increase significantly in the future.  

We
will be dependent upon loans from management and others, to finance our planned operations through the next 12 months. We do not
have any known requirements for significant capital expenditures in the coming 12 months.  

Additional
capital may not be available when required or on favorable terms. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to significantly
reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain or
potential markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such
securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material
current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

As
reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at September
30, 2016 of $485,597, a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $98,746 and net cash used in operating activities
of $74,326 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern.  

The
Company is attempting to produce sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support
its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to produce sufficient revenue and in its ability
to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise
additional funds. The audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm, dated April 13, 2016, included an explanatory
paragraph about the existence of substantial doubt concerning the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
have identified the following policies below as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted
by the application of the following accounting policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments.
These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact
quarterly or annual results of operations. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly
as expected, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies
are described in the following paragraphs.  

Principles
of Consolidation.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, BODT through September 26, 2014. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Income
Tax Provision.  The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740  Income Taxes .
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  

Use
of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

Not
applicable.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has reviewed
and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on such
review and evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (a) is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to the
Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. This is primarily a result of minimal funding and resulting lack of administrative support
and lack of segregation of duties.  

A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the benefits of controls relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Because of the inherent
limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.
