In the opinion of management, these unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for the interim periods presented. Results for interim periods should not be considered indicative of results for the full year or for any other interim period. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and the other notes to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 23, 2016. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards    

 Effective April 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis . Under the amendments in this update, all reporting entities are within the scope of Subtopic 810-10,  Consolidation Overall , including limited partnerships and similar legal entities, unless a scope exception applies. The adoption of this guidance did not change the entities consolidated by the Company. 

(  d  )   
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards    

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  and created the new Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and added ASC Subtopic 340-40,  Other Assets and Deferred Costs Contracts with Customers . The guidance in this update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , and most industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the codification. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which defers the effective date for the Company from April 1, 2017 to April 1, 2018 while permitting early adoption as of April 1, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) . The amendments in this ASU make targeted improvements to clarify the principal versus agent assessment and lead to more consistent application. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing . The amendments in this ASU clarify the guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients . The amendments in this ASU do not change the core revenue recognition principles. Instead, the amendments address certain issues identified in the guidance on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.

    In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopi  c 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  . The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are   currently in U.S. auditing standards. The amendments are effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this new standard is not expected to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments are effective for the Company beginning April 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . This ASU requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current GAAP, however has been updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. The amendments are effective for the Company beginning April 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The amendments are effective for the Company beginning April 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted as of April 1, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for the Company beginning April 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

      Finance Receivables        

 Finance receivables consisted of the following:  

Finance receivables include retail loans with a principal balance of $8.6 billion and $7.8 billion as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively, which have been transferred to securitization trusts and considered to be legally isolated but do not qualify for sale accounting treatment. These finance receivables are restricted as collateral for the payment of the related secured debt obligations. Refer to Note 9 for additional information. 
 The uninsured portions of the direct financing lease residual values were $117 million and $173 million at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. Included in the gain or loss on disposition of lease vehicles are end of term charges on both direct financing and operating leases of $8 million and $6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $16 million and $13 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Credit Quality of Financing Receivables  
 Credit losses are an expected cost of extending credit. The majority of the credit risk is with consumer financing and to a lesser extent with dealer financing. Credit risk can be affected by general economic conditions. Adverse changes such as a rise in unemployment rates can increase the likelihood of defaults. Declines in used vehicle prices can reduce the amount of recoveries on repossessed collateral. Credit risk on dealer loans is affected primarily by the financial strength of the dealers within the portfolio. Exposure to credit risk is managed through purchasing standards, pricing of contracts for expected losses, focusing collection efforts to minimize losses, and ongoing reviews of the financial condition of dealers. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses  
 The allowance for credit losses is management s estimate of probable losses incurred on finance receivables, which requires significant judgment and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. The allowance is based on management s evaluation of many factors, including the Company s historical credit loss experience, the value of the underlying collateral, delinquency trends, and economic conditions.

 AMERICAN HONDA FINANCE CORPORATION  
 AND SUBSIDIARIES  
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
   
    Consumer finance receivables in the retail loan and direct financing lease portfolio segments are collectively evaluated for impairment. Delinquencies and losses are monitored on an ongoing basis and this historical experience provides   the primary basis for estimating the allowance. Management utilizes various methodologies when estimating the allowance for credit losses, including models which incorporate vintage loss and delinquency migration analysis. These models take into considera  tion attributes of the portfolio including loan-to-value ratios, internal and external credit scores, and collateral types. Market and economic factors such as used vehicle prices, unemployment rates, and consumer debt service burdens are also incorporated   into these models.  
 Dealer loans are individually evaluated for impairment when specifically identified as impaired. Dealer loans are considered to be impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the contract. The Company s determination of whether dealer loans are impaired is based on evaluations of dealership payment history, financial condition, and ability to perform under the terms of the loan agreements. Dealer loans that have not been specifically identified as impaired are collectively evaluated for impairment. 
 There were no modifications to dealer loans that constituted troubled debt restructurings during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
 The Company generally does not grant concessions on consumer finance receivables that are considered to be troubled debt restructurings other than modifications of retail loans in reorganization proceedings pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Retail loans modified under bankruptcy protection were not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company does allow payment deferrals on consumer finance receivables. However, these payment deferrals are not considered to be troubled debt restructurings since the deferrals are deemed to be insignificant and interest continues to accrue during the deferral period.

    Credit Quality Indicators   
 Retail Loan and Direct Financing Lease Portfolio Segments  
 The Company utilizes proprietary credit scoring systems to evaluate the credit risk of applicants for retail loans and leases. The scoring systems assign internal credit scores based on various factors including the applicant s credit bureau information and contract terms. The internal credit score provides the primary basis for credit decisions when acquiring retail loan and lease contracts. Internal credit scores are determined only at the time of origination and are not reassessed during the life of the contract. 
 Subsequent to origination, collection experience provides a current indication of the credit quality of consumer finance receivables. The likelihood of accounts charging off becomes significantly higher once an account becomes 60 days delinquent. Accounts that are current or less than 60 days past due are considered to be performing. Accounts that are 60 days or more past due are considered to be nonperforming. The table below presents the Company s portfolio of retail loans and direct financing leases by this credit quality indicator: 

Dealer Loan Portfolio Segment  
 The Company utilizes an internal risk rating system to evaluate dealer credit risk. Dealerships are assigned an internal risk rating based on an assessment of their financial condition. Factors including liquidity, financial strength, management effectiveness, and operating efficiency are evaluated when assessing their financial condition. Financing limits and interest rates are determined from these risk ratings. Monitoring activities including financial reviews and inventory inspections are performed more frequently for dealerships with weaker risk ratings. The financial conditions of dealerships are reviewed and their risk ratings are updated at least annually. 
 The Company s outstanding portfolio of dealer loans has been divided into two groups in the tables below. Group A includes the loans of dealerships with the strongest internal risk rating. Group B includes the loans of all remaining dealers. Although the likelihood of losses can be higher for dealerships in Group B, the overall risk of losses is not considered to be significant.

      Investment in Operating Leases

The Company recognized $16 million and $18 million of estimated early termination losses due to lessee defaults for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Actual net losses realized for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $14 million and $12 million, respectively. The Company recognized $31 million and $29 million of estimated early termination losses due to lessee defaults for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Actual net losses realized for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $24 million and $18 million, respectively. 
 Included in the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are provisions related to past due receivables on operating leases in the amounts of $6 million and $5 million, respectively. Included in the provision for credit losses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are provisions related to past due receivables on operating leases in the amounts of $11 million and $9 million, respectively.

    The income statement effect of derivative instruments is presented bel  ow. There were no derivative instruments designated as part of a hedge accounting relationship during the periods presented.   

The fair value of derivative instruments is subject to the fluctuations in market interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Since the Company has elected not to apply hedge accounting, the volatility in the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized in earnings. All settlements of derivative instruments are recognized within cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  
 These derivative instruments also contain an element of credit risk in the event the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, the Company minimizes the risk exposure by limiting the counterparties to major financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. In the event of default, all counterparties are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements. The Company generally does not require or place collateral for these instruments under credit support agreements.

 Other  
 AHM periodically sponsors programs that allow lessees to terminate their lease contracts prior to the contractual maturity date. AHM compensates the Company for rental payments that were waived under these programs. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $1 million and less than $1 million, respectively, and during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $4 million and $5 million, respectively, under these programs which were reflected as proceeds on the disposition of the returned lease vehicles.  
 As a result of the recall of certain Honda and Acura vehicles announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company has been experiencing delays in the disposition of returned lease vehicles and repossessed vehicles. HCI has agreed to compensate the Company for certain costs resulting from the delay in disposition of affected vehicles in Canada. 
 The majority of the amounts due from the Parent and affiliated companies at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 related to subsidies. The majority of the amounts due to the Parent and affiliated companies at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 related to wholesale flooring invoices payable to the Parent. These receivable and payable accounts are non-interest-bearing and short-term in nature and are expected to be settled in the normal course of business.

      Income Taxes      

 The Company s effective tax rate was 36.2% and 34.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 38.3% and 34.3% for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the relative effect of retroactive U.S. tax law changes, enacted in December 2015, on AHFC s deduction for qualified domestic production activities allocated between the Parent and affiliated companies. The increase in the effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was also due to the change in AHFC s deduction for qualified domestic production activities, as well as changes in apportionment methods and tax rates in certain states.   
 Foreign undistributed earnings are generally subject to U.S. taxation when repatriated and when subject to U.S. taxation may generally be offset by foreign tax credits. To date, the Company has not provided for federal income taxes on its share of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiary, HCFI, that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At September 30, 2016, $738 million of accumulated undistributed earnings of HCFI were deemed to be so reinvested. If the undistributed earnings as of September 30, 2016 were to be distributed, the tax liability associated with these indefinitely reinvested earnings would be $176 million. The Company does not expect to repatriate any undistributed earnings in the foreseeable future. 
 The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, signed on December 18, 2015, enacted the tax law that defers the imposition of U.S. taxes on certain foreign active financing income until that income is repatriated to the U.S. as a dividend. AHFC will no longer recognize tax on its share of such income to the extent it is indefinitely reinvested. 
 The changes in the unrecognized tax benefits for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were not significant. The Company does not expect any material changes in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits during the remainder of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company is subject to examination by U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions for returns filed for the taxable years ended March 31, 2008 through 2015, with the exception of one state which is subject to examination for returns filed for the taxable years ended March 31, 2001 through 2015. The Company s Canadian subsidiary, HCFI, is subject to federal examination for returns filed for the taxable years ended March 31, 2010 through 2016, and provincial examination for returns filed for the taxable years ended March 31, 2009 through 2016. The Company believes appropriate provision has been made for all outstanding issues for all open years. 

(  8  )   
 
 Commitments and Contingencies     

 The Company leases certain premises and equipment on a long-term basis under noncancelable leases. Some of these leases require the Company to pay property taxes, insurance, and other expenses. Lease expense was $2 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $5 million for both the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
 The Company extends commercial revolving lines of credit to dealerships to support their business activities including facilities refurbishment and general working capital requirements. The amounts borrowed are generally secured by the assets of the borrowing entity. The majority of the lines have annual renewal periods. The unused balance of commercial revolving lines of credit was $235 million as of September 30, 2016. The Company also has commitments to finance the construction of auto dealerships. The remaining unfunded balance for these construction loans was $15 million as of September 30, 2016. 
 Legal Proceedings and Regulatory Matters 
 The Company establishes accruals for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. When able, the Company will determine estimates of reasonably possible loss or range of loss, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability. Given the inherent uncertainty associated with legal matters, the actual costs of resolving legal claims and associated costs of defense may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts for which accruals have been established.

    The Company is involved, in the ordinary course of business, in various legal proceedings including claims of individual customers and purported class acti  on lawsuits. Certain of these actions are similar to suits filed against other financial institutions and captive finance companies. Most of these proceedings concern customer allegations of wrongful repossession or defamation of credit. The Company is als  o subject to governmental reviews and inquiries from time to time. Based on available information and established accruals, management does not believe it is reasonably possible that the results of these proceedings, in the aggregate, will have a material   adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.   

(  9  )   
 
 Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities (VIE)     

 The trusts utilized for on-balance sheet securitizations are VIEs, which are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these trusts due to (i) the power to direct the activities of the trusts that most significantly impact the trusts  economic performance through its role as servicer, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant to the trusts through the subordinated certificates and residual interest retained. The debt securities issued by the trusts to third-party investors along with the assets of the trusts are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued notes through asset-backed securitizations, which were accounted for as secured financing transactions totaling $3.4 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. The notes were secured by receivables with an initial principal balance of $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. 
 The table below presents the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of consolidated securitization trusts as they are reported in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. All amounts exclude intercompany balances, which have been eliminated upon consolidation. The assets of the trusts can only be used to settle the obligations of the trusts. The third-party investors in the obligations of the trusts do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company.

 Included with other assets in the Company s consolidated balance sheets (Note 10).     

 In their role as servicers, AHFC and HCFI collect principal and interest payments on the underlying receivables on behalf of the securitization trusts. Cash collected during a calendar month is required to be remitted to the trusts in the following month. AHFC and HCFI are not restricted from using the cash collected for their general purposes prior to the remittance to the trusts. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, AHFC and HCFI had combined cash collections of $432 million and $422 million, respectively, which were required to be remitted to the trusts.

          Fair Value Measurements      

 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are those other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Nonperformance risk is also required to be reflected in the fair value measurement, including an entity s own credit standing when measuring the fair value of a liability.  
 Recurring Fair Value Measurements  
 The following tables summarize the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  

The valuation techniques of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are described below:  
 Derivative Instruments  
 The Company s derivatives are transacted in over-the-counter markets and quoted market prices are not readily available. The Company uses third-party developed valuation models to value derivative instruments. These models estimate fair values using discounted cash flow modeling techniques, which utilize the contractual terms of the derivative instruments and market-based inputs, including interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Discount rates incorporate counterparty and HMC specific credit default spreads to reflect nonperformance risk.  
 21 
 
 AMERICAN HONDA FINANCE CORPORATION  
 AND SUBSIDIARIES  
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
   
    The Company s derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 since all significant inputs are observable and do not require management judgment. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the s  ix   months ended   September 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  . Refer to Note 5 for additional information on derivative instruments.   
 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  
 The following tables summarize nonrecurring fair value measurements recognized for assets still held at the end of the reporting periods presented:  

The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used in nonrecurring fair value measurements, which relate to the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting on long-lived assets.  
 Vehicles Held for Disposition  
 Vehicles held for disposition consist of returned and repossessed vehicles. They are valued at the lower of their carrying value or estimated fair value, less estimated disposition costs. The fair value is based on current average selling prices of like vehicles at wholesale used vehicle auctions. For vehicles affected by the recall announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the fair value reflects the estimated impact of the delays in disposition.

    Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 The following tables summarize the carrying values and fair values of the Company s financial instruments except for those measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial assets and liabilities are excluded from fair value disclosure requirements including the Company s direct financing lease receivables and investment in operating leases.  

The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash  
 The carrying values reported on the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair values due to the short-term nature of the assets and negligible credit risk. Restricted cash accounts held by securitization trusts are included in other assets.  
 23 
 
 AMERICAN HONDA FINANCE CORPORATION  
 AND SUBSIDIARIES  
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
   
    Finance Receivables   
 The fair values of the Company s retail loans and dealer wholesale loans are based on estimated proceeds of hypothetical whole loan transactions. It is assumed that market participants in whole loan transactions would acquire the loans with the intent of securitizing the loans. Internally developed valuation models are used to estimate the pricing of securitization transactions, which is adjusted for the estimated costs of securitization transactions and required profit margins of market participants. The models incorporate projected cash flows of the underlying receivables, which include prepayment and credit loss assumptions. The models also incorporate current market interest rates and market spreads for the credit and liquidity risk of securities issued in the securitizations. The estimated fair values of the Company s dealer commercial loans are based on a discounted cash flow model.  
 Debt  
 The fair value of the Company s debt is estimated based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Projected cash flows are discounted using current market interest rates and credit spreads for debt with similar maturities. The Company s specific nonperformance risk is reflected in the credit spreads on the Company s unsecured debt.  
 The above fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no active market exists for a portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates of such financial instruments are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  
 Fair value information presented in the tables above is based on information available at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016. Although the Company is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been updated since those dates, and therefore, the current estimates of fair value at dates subsequent to those dates may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

 Segment Information     

 The Company s reportable segments are based on the two geographic regions where operating results are measured and evaluated by management: the United States and Canada.  
 Segment performance is evaluated using an internal measurement basis, which differs from the Company s consolidated results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Segment performance is evaluated on a pre-tax basis before the effect of valuation adjustments on derivative instruments and revaluations of foreign currency denominated debt. Since the Company does not elect to apply hedge accounting, the impact to earnings resulting from these valuation adjustments as reported under GAAP is not representative of segment performance as evaluated by management. Realized gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of realized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated debt, are included in the measure of net revenues when evaluating segment performance.  
 No adjustments are made to segment performance to allocate any revenues or expenses. Financing products offered throughout the United States and Canada are substantially similar. Segment revenues from the various financing products are reported on the same basis as GAAP consolidated results.

Item   2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    
 Overview 
 Our primary focus, in collaboration with AHM and HCI, is to provide support for the sale of Honda and Acura products and maintain customer and dealer satisfaction and loyalty. To deliver this support effectively, we seek to maintain competitive cost of funds, efficient operations, and effective risk and compliance management. The primary factors influencing our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition include the volume of Honda and Acura sales and the portion of those sales that we finance, our cost of funds, competition from other financial institutions, consumer credit defaults, and used motor vehicle prices. 
 A substantial portion of our consumer financing business is acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and HCI. The volume of incentive financing programs and the allocation of those programs between retail loans and leases may vary from fiscal period to fiscal period depending upon the respective marketing strategies of AHM and HCI. AHM and HCI s marketing strategies are based in part on their business planning, in which we do not participate. Therefore we cannot predict the level of incentive financing programs AHM and HCI may sponsor in the future. Our consumer financing acquisition volumes are substantially dependent on the extent to which incentive financing programs are offered. Increases in incentive financing programs generally increase our financing penetration rates, which typically results in increased financing acquisition volumes for us. The amount of subsidy payments we receive from AHM and HCI is dependent on the terms of the incentive financing programs and the interest rate environment. Subsidy payments are received upon acquisition and recognized in revenue throughout the life of the loan or lease; therefore a significant change in the level of incentive financing programs in a fiscal period often may not be reflected in our results of operations for that period. The amount of subsidy income we recognize in a fiscal period is dependent on the cumulative level of subsidized contracts outstanding that were acquired through incentive financing programs. 
 We seek to maintain high quality consumer and dealer account portfolios, which we support with strong underwriting standards, risk-based pricing, and effective collection capabilities. Our cost of funds is facilitated by the diversity of our funding sources, and effective interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management. We manage expenses to increase our profitability, including adjusting staffing needs based upon our business volumes and centralizing support functions. Additionally, we use risk and compliance management practices to optimize credit and residual value risk levels and maintain compliance with our pricing, underwriting and servicing policies at the United States, Canadian, state and provincial levels. 
 In our business operations, we incur costs related to funding, credit loss, residual value loss, and general and administrative expenses, among other expenses. 
 We analyze our operations in two business segments defined by geography: the United States and Canada. We measure the performance of our United States and Canada segments on a pre-tax basis before the effect of valuation adjustments on derivative instruments and revaluations of foreign currency denominated debt. For additional information regarding our segments, see Note 14 Segment Information of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . The following tables and the related discussion are presented based on our geographically segmented consolidated financial statements. 
 This report contains translations of certain foreign currency amounts into U.S. dollars at the rates specified below solely for your convenience. These translations should not be construed as representations that the foreign currency amounts actually represent such U.S. dollar amounts or that they could be converted into U.S. dollars at the rates indicated. U.S. dollar equivalents for  C$  (Canadian dollar) amounts are calculated based on the exchange rate on September 30, 2016 of 1.3127 per U.S. dollar. 
 References in this report to our  fiscal year 2017  and  fiscal year 2016  refer to our fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 and our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, respectively.  
 Results of Operations  
 The following table presents our income before income taxes:  

27 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
 Our consolidated income before income taxes was $307 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to $364 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. This decline of $57 million, or 16%, was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit loss of $37 million, increase in interest expense of $35 million, increase in loss on foreign currency revaluation of debt of $11 million, a decline in revenue from direct financing leases of $10 million and a loss on disposition of lease vehicles of $1 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $8 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016, partially offset by an increase in operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, of $45 million. 
 Comparison of the Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
 Our consolidated income before income taxes was $702 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to $711 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. This decline of $9 million, or 1%, was primarily due to increase in interest expense of $64 million, a loss on derivative instruments of $57 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $3 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016, an increase in provision for credit loss of $37 million, a decline in revenue from direct financing leases of $22 million, a decline in revenue from retail loans of $19 million and a decline in gain on disposition of lease vehicles of $12 million, partially offset by an increase in operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, of $105 million and a gain on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated debt of $64 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $35 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. 
 Segment Results Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
 Results of operations for the United States segment and the Canada segment are summarized below:  

Revenues  
 Revenue from retail loans in the United States segment declined by $8 million, or 3%, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding retail loans, which was partially offset by higher yields. Revenue from retail loans in the Canada segment increased by $2 million, or 6%, primarily due to higher average outstanding retail loans.

Operating lease revenue increased by $143 million, or 12%, in the United States segment   and by $75 million, or 64%, in the Canada segment during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increases in revenue were due to higher average outstanding operating lease assets in both the United State  s and Canada segments.  
 Direct financing lease revenue, which is generated only in Canada, declined by $10 million, or 53%, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016 due to the continued decline in outstanding direct financing lease assets.  
 Revenue from dealer loans in the United States segment increased by $5 million, or 19%, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, due to an increase in average outstanding dealer loans and higher yields.  
 Consolidated subsidy income from AHM and HCI sponsored incentive programs increased by $34 million, or 12%, to $307 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to $273 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. This increase was attributable to higher outstanding incentive leases, which was partially offset by lower outstanding incentive retail loans. 
 Depreciation on operating leases  
 Depreciation on operating leases increased by $111 million, or 11%, in the United States segment and by $62 million, or 65%, in the Canada segment during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increases in depreciation were primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments. 
 Operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, in the United States segment   increased by $32 million, or 13%, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. This increase was attributable to the growth in our operating lease assets and higher net revenue on more recently acquired operating lease assets. Operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, in the Canada segment increased by $13 million, or 59%, due to the growth in operating lease assets. 
 Interest expense  
 Interest expense in the United States segment increased by $31 million, or 25%, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increase was attributable to higher average cost of debt primarily due to an increase in rates on floating rate debt. Interest expense in the Canada segment increased by $4 million, or 22%, primarily due to an increase in average outstanding debt.   See    Liquidity and Capital Resources   below for more information. 
 Gain/loss on disposition of lease vehicles  
 In the United States segment, we recognized a loss of $4 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $6 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. The loss during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 was due to a decline in auction prices during the period and increased valuation adjustments of vehicles held for disposition. We have been experiencing delays in the disposition of returned lease vehicles that were affected by the recall announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. As a result, the outstanding balance of vehicles held for disposition has increased and additional valuation adjustments were recognized to reflect the estimated impact of the delays in disposition.   The gain on disposition of lease vehicles in the Canada segment increased by $1 million, or 50%. See    Financial Condition Lease Residual Value Risk   below for more information. 
 Provision for credit losses  
 The provision for credit losses in the United States segment increased by $38 million, or 123%, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increase in the provision was the result of higher net charge-offs and increasing our allowance for credit losses to reflect weaker credit performance of recent vintages. The provision for credit losses in the Canada segment declined by $1 million, or 25%, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, due to a slight decline in net charge-offs. See    Financial Condition Credit Risk   below for more information. 
 Early termination losses on operating leases  
 Early termination loss on operating leases declined by $2 million, or 12%, in the United States segment during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. Early termination loss on operating leases in the Canada segment were consistent during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. See    Financial Condition Credit Risk   below for more information. 
 29 

Gain/loss on derivative instruments   
 In the United States segment, we recognized a gain on derivative instruments of $21 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $29 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. The gain in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 was attributable to gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps of $73 million and cross currency swaps of $20 million, which were partially offset by losses on pay float interest rate swaps of $72 million. The gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps and losses on pay float interest rate swaps during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 were due to a rise in interest rates. We recognized gains on Euro currency swaps which were partially offset by losses on Sterling currency swaps during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 as the U.S. dollar weakened against the Euro and strengthened against Sterling. In the Canada segment, we recognized a gain on derivative instruments of $1 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $11 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. See    Derivatives   below for more information. 
 Gain/loss on foreign currency revaluation of debt  
 In the United States segment, we recognized a loss on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated debt of $22 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $11 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. The loss during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 was attributable to losses on Euro denominated debt which was partially offset by gains on Sterling denominated debt as the U.S. dollar weakened against the Euro and strengthened against Sterling.  
 Income tax expense  
 Our consolidated effective tax rate was 36.2% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and 34.1% for the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the relative effect of retroactive U.S. tax law changes, enacted in December 2015, on AHFC s deduction for qualified domestic production activities allocated between the Parent and affiliated companies. For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 Income Taxes of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 Segment Results Comparison of the Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
 Results of operations for the United States segment and the Canada segment are summarized below: 

30 

Revenues   
 Revenue from retail loans in the United States segment declined by $23 million, or 4%, during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding retail loans, which was partially offset by higher yields. Revenue from retail loans in the Canada segment increased by $4 million, or 5%, primarily due to higher average outstanding retail loans. 
 Operating lease revenue increased by $275 million, or 11%, in the United States segment and by $145 million, or 67%, in the Canada segment during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increases in revenue were due to higher average outstanding operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments. 
 Direct financing lease revenue, which is generated only in Canada, declined by $22 million, or 51%, during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016 due to the continued decline in outstanding direct financing lease assets.  
 Revenue from dealer loans in the United States segment increased by $12 million, or 23%, during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, due to an increase in average outstanding dealer loans and higher yields.  
 Consolidated subsidy income from AHM and HCI sponsored incentive programs increased by $54 million, or 10%, to $598 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to $544 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. This increase was attributable to higher outstanding incentive leases, which was partially offset by lower outstanding incentive retail loans. 
 Depreciation on operating leases  
 Depreciation on operating leases increased by $193 million, or 10%, in the United States segment and by $122 million, or 69%, in the Canada segment during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increases in depreciation were primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments. 
 Operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, in the United States segment   increased by $82 million, or 16%, during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. This increase was attributable to the growth in our operating lease assets and higher net revenue on more recently acquired operating lease assets. Operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, in the Canada segment increased by $23 million, or 58%, due to the growth in operating lease assets. 
 Interest expense  
 Interest expense in the United States segment increased by $59 million, or 24%, during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increase was attributable to higher average cost of debt primarily due to an increase in rates on floating rate debt. Interest expense in the Canada segment increased by $5 million, or 13%, primarily due to an increase in average outstanding debt.   See    Liquidity and Capital Resources   below for more information. 
 Gain/loss on disposition of lease vehicles  
 The gain on disposition of lease vehicles in the United States segment declined by $14 million, or 52%, during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The lower gain was due to a decline in auction prices during the period and increased valuation adjustments of vehicles held for disposition. We have been experiencing delays in the disposition of returned lease vehicles that were affected by the recall announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. As a result, the outstanding balance of vehicles held for disposition has increased and additional valuation adjustments were recognized to reflect the estimated impact of the delays in disposition.   The gain on disposition of lease vehicles in the Canada segment increased by $2 million, or 67%. See    Financial Condition Lease Residual Value Risk   below for more information. 
 Provision for credit losses  
 The provision for credit losses in the United States segment increased by $39 million, or 67%, during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increase in the provision was the result of higher net charge-offs and increasing our allowance for credit losses to reflect weaker credit performance of recent vintages. The provision for credit losses in the Canada segment declined by $2 million, or 25%, during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, due to a slight decline in net charge-offs. See    Financial Condition Credit Risk   below for more information. 
 31 

Early termination losses on operating leases   
 Early termination loss on operating leases increased by $1 million, or 4%, in the United States segment and by $1 million, or 50%, in the Canada segment during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increases in losses were primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments. See    Financial Condition Credit Risk   below for more information. 
 Gain/loss on derivative instruments  
 In the United States segment, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments of $55 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $12 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. The loss in the first six months of fiscal year 2017 was attributable to losses on cross currency swaps of $50 million and pay float interest rate swaps of $20 million, which were partially offset by gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps of $15 million. The losses on pay float interest rate swaps and gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 were due to a rise in interest rates. The losses on cross currency swaps during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 were attributable to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Euro and Sterling. In the Canada segment, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments of $2 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $9 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. See    Derivatives   below for more information. 
 Gain/loss on foreign currency revaluation of debt  
 In the United States segment, we recognized a gain on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated debt of $64 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $35 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. The gain during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 was primarily attributable to gains on Euro and Sterling denominated debt as the U.S. dollar strengthened against these currencies. 
 Income tax expense  
 Our consolidated effective tax rate was 38.3% for the first six months of fiscal year 2017 and 34.3% for the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to changes in apportionment methods and tax rates in certain states, and the relative effect of retroactive U.S. tax law changes, enacted in December 2015, on AHFC s deduction for qualified domestic production activities allocated between the Parent and affiliated companies.

 The following table summarizes the number of retail loans and leases we acquired and the number of such loans and leases acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and HCI:  

(1)   
 
 A unit represents one retail loan or lease, as noted, that was originated in the United States and acquired by AHFC or its subsidiaries, or that was originated in Canada and acquired by HCFI, in each case during the period shown.     

(2)   
 
 Represents the number of retail loans and leases acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and/or HCI and only those contracts with subsidy payments. Excludes contracts where contractual rates met or exceeded our yield requirements and subsidy payments were not required.     

 33 

Consumer Financing Penetration Rates   
 The following table summarizes the percentage of AHM and/or HCI sales of new automobiles and motorcycles that were financed either with retail loans or leases that we acquired:  

34 

Consumer Financing Asset Balances   
 The following table summarizes our outstanding retail loan and lease asset balances and units:  

(1)   
 
 A unit represents one retail loan or lease, as noted, that was outstanding as of the date shown.     

(2)   
 
 Securitized retail loans represent the portion of total retail loans that have been sold in securitization transactions but continue to be recognized on our balance sheet. Securitized retail loans are included in the amounts for total retail loans.       

 In the United States segment, retail loan acquisition volumes increased by 3% during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to an increase in used auto loan acquisitions. Lease acquisition volumes increased by 9% during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher lease incentive volumes. AHM continued to focus their support on lease incentive programs compared with retail loan incentive programs during the first six months of fiscal year 2017.  
 In the Canada segment, retail loan acquisition volumes increased by 10% during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher retail loan incentive volumes. Lease acquisition volumes declined by 4% during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. Outstanding direct financing lease assets continued to decline and operating lease assets continued to increase during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 as the result of our remaining direct financing leases maturing and all newly acquired leases being classified as operating leases.  
 35 

Dealer Financing   
 Wholesale Flooring Financing Penetration Rates  
 The following table summarizes the number of dealerships with wholesale flooring financing agreements as a percentage of total authorized Honda and Acura dealerships in the United States and/or Canada, as applicable:  

Wholesale Flooring Financing Percentage of Sales  
 The following table summarizes the percentage of AHM unit sales in the United States and/or HCI unit sales in Canada, as applicable, that we financed through wholesale flooring loans with dealerships:  

36 

Dealer Financing Asset Balances   
 The following table summarizes our outstanding dealer financing asset balances and units:  

(1)   
 
 A unit represents one automobile, motorcycle, power equipment, or marine engine, as applicable, financed through a wholesale flooring loan that was outstanding as of the date shown.     

 Credit Risk  
 Credit losses are an expected cost of extending credit. The majority of our credit risk is in consumer financing and to a lesser extent in dealer financing. Credit risk of our portfolio of consumer finance receivables can be affected by general economic conditions. Adverse changes such as a rise in unemployment rates can increase the likelihood of defaults. Declines in used vehicle prices can reduce the amount of recoveries on repossessed collateral. We manage our exposure to credit risk in retail loans and direct financing leases by monitoring and adjusting our underwriting standards, which affect the level of credit risk that we assume, pricing contracts for expected losses, and focusing collection efforts to minimize losses.  
 We are also exposed to credit risk on our portfolio of operating lease assets. We expect a portion of our operating leases to terminate prior to their scheduled maturities when lessees default on their contractual obligations. Losses are generally realized upon the disposition of the repossessed operating lease vehicles. The factors affecting credit risk on our operating leases and our management of the risk are similar to that of our retail loans and direct financing leases.  
 Credit risk on dealer loans is affected primarily by the financial strength of the dealers within the portfolio, the value of collateral securing the financings, and economic and market factors that could affect the creditworthiness of dealers. We manage our exposure to credit risk in dealer financing by performing comprehensive reviews of dealers prior to establishing financing arrangements and monitoring the payment performance and creditworthiness of these dealers on an ongoing basis. In the event of default by a dealer, we seek all available legal remedies pursuant to related dealer agreements, guarantees, security interests on collateral, or liens on dealership assets. Additionally, we have entered into agreements with AHM and HCI that provide for their repurchase, at the outstanding financed amount, of new, unused, undamaged and unregistered vehicle or equipment that have been repossessed from dealers who defaulted under the terms of its wholesale flooring agreement.  
 37 

An allowance for credit losses is maintained for management s estimate of probable losses incu  rred on finance receivables. We also maintain an estimate for early termination losses on operating lease assets due to lessee defaults and an allowance for credit losses on past due operating lease rental payments.   
 Additional information regarding credit losses is provided in the discussion of    Critical Accounting Policies Credit Losses   below.  
 38 

The following table presents information with respect to our allowance for credit losses and credit loss experience of our finance receivables and losses related   to lessee defaults on our operating leases:  

39 

(1)   
 
        Ending and average receivable balances exclude the allowance for credit losses, write-down of lease residual values, unearned subvention income related to our incentive financing programs and deferred origination costs. Average receivable balances are calc  ulated based on the average of each month s ending receivables balance for that fiscal year.      

(2)   
 
 For the purposes of determining whether a contract is delinquent, payment is generally considered to have been made, in the case of (i) dealer finance receivables, upon receipt of 100% of the payment when due and (ii) consumer finance receivables, upon receipt of 90% of the sum of the current monthly payment plus any overdue monthly payments. Delinquent amounts presented are the aggregated principal balances of delinquent finance receivables.     

(3)   
 
 Provisions for past due operating lease rental payments are also included in total provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income.       

In the United States segment, the provision for credit losses on our finance receivables was $86 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to $49 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increase in the provision was the result of higher net charge-offs and increasing our allowance for credit losses to reflect weaker credit performance of recent vintages. Default frequencies and loss severities have increased in recent vintages, due in part to the increase in the volume of retail loans with 72 month terms. We recognized early termination losses on operating lease assets of $28 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to $27 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses was primarily attributable to the growth in operating lease assets.  
 In the Canada segment, the provision for credit losses on our finance receivables was $6 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to $8 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. The decline in the provision for credit losses was due in part to a slight decline in net charge-offs. Early termination losses on operating lease assets was $3 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 compared to $2 million during the same period in fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses was primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets. 
 Lease Residual Value Risk  
 Contractual residual values of lease vehicles are determined at lease inception based on expectations of future used vehicle values, taking into consideration external industry data and our own historical experience. Lease customers have the option at the end of the lease term to return the vehicle to the dealer or to buy the vehicle at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance). Returned lease vehicles can be purchased by the grounding dealer at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance) or for a market based price. Returned lease vehicles that are not purchased by the grounding dealers are sold through online and physical auctions. We are exposed to risk of loss on the disposition of returned lease vehicles when the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles are less than the contractual residual values at the end of the lease term.  
 We assess our estimates for end of lease term market values of leased vehicles, at minimum, on a quarterly basis. The primary factors affecting the estimates are the percentage of leased vehicles that we expect to be returned by the lessee at the end of lease term and the expected loss severity. Factors considered in this evaluation include, among other factors, economic conditions, historical trends, and market information on new and used vehicles. For operating leases, adjustments to estimated residual values are made on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the lease and are included as depreciation expense. For direct financing leases, downward adjustments for declines in estimated residual values deemed to be other-than-temporary are recognized as a loss on lease residual values in the period in which the estimate changed. Additional information regarding lease residual values is provided in the discussion of    Critical Accounting Policies   Determination of Lease Residual Values   below.  
 We also review our investment in operating leases for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. If impairment conditions are met, impairment losses are measured by the amount carrying values exceed their fair values. We did not recognize impairment losses due to declines in estimated residual values  during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 and the same period in fiscal year 2016.  
 We have been experiencing delays in the disposition of returned lease vehicles that were affected by the recall announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. As a result, the outstanding balance of vehicles held for disposition has increased during the first six months of fiscal year 2017 and valuation adjustments were recognized to reflect the estimated impact of the delays in disposition. Further delays may occur with regard to the completion of repairs and auction sales of affected vehicles beyond our current estimates, which would result in additional delays in cash flows from sales proceeds, and may result in additional valuation adjustments of vehicles held for disposition and/or impairment. 
 40 

The following table summarizes our number of lease ter  minations and the method of disposition:   

(1)   
 
 A unit represents one terminated lease by their method of disposition during the period shown. Unit counts do not include leases that were terminated due to lessee defaults.     

(2)   
 
 Includes vehicles purchased by lessees or dealers for the contractual residual value at lease maturity or the outstanding contractual balance if purchased prior to lease maturity.     

(3)   
 
 Includes vehicles sold through online auctions and market based pricing options under our dealer direct programs or through physical auctions.    

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 Our liquidity strategy is to fund current and future obligations through our cash flows from operations and our diversified funding programs in a cost and risk effective manner. Our cash flows are generally impacted by cash requirements related to the volume of finance receivable and operating lease acquisitions and various operating and funding costs incurred, which are largely funded through payments received on our assets and our funding strategies outlined below. As noted, the levels of incentive financing sponsored by AHM and HCI can impact our financial results and liquidity from period to period. Increases or decreases in incentive financing programs typically increase or decrease our financing penetration rates, respectively, which result in increased or decreased acquisition volumes and increased or decreased liquidity needs, respectively. At acquisition, we receive the subsidy payments, which reduce the cost of consumer loan and lease contracts acquired, and we recognize such payments as revenue over the term of the loan or lease.  
 In an effort to minimize liquidity risk and interest rate risk and the resulting negative effects on our margins, results of operations and cash flows, our funding strategy incorporates investor diversification and the utilization of multiple funding sources including commercial paper, medium term notes, bank loans and asset-backed securities. AHFC has continued to reduce the use of related party debt as a funding source. We incorporate a funding strategy that takes into consideration factors such as the interest rate environment, domestic and foreign capital market conditions, maturity profiles, and economic conditions. We believe that our funding sources, combined with cash provided by operating and investing activities, will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our debt service and working capital requirements over the next twelve months.  
 41 

Summary of Outstanding Debt   
 The table below presents a summary of our outstanding debt by various funding sources:  

Commercial Paper  
 As of September 30, 2016, we had commercial paper programs in the United States of $7.0 billion and in Canada of C$2.0 billion ($1.5 billion). Interest rates on the commercial paper are fixed at the time of issuance. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, consolidated commercial paper month-end outstanding principal balances ranged from $4.7 billion to $6.6 billion and the outstanding daily balance averaged $5.7 billion. 
 Related Party Debt  
 AHFC issues fixed rate notes to AHM to help fund AHFC s general corporate operations. HCFI issues fixed rate notes to HCI to help fund HCFI s general corporate operations. Interest rates are based on prevailing rates of debt with comparable terms. Generally, the term of these notes is less than 120 days. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, consolidated related party debt month-end principal balances ranged from $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion and the outstanding daily balance averaged $2.1 billion.  
 42 

Bank Loans   
 During the six months ended September 30, 2016, AHFC did not enter into any new bank loan agreements and HCFI entered into two floating rate term loan agreements for an aggregate of C$375 million ($286 million). As of September 30, 2016, we had bank loans denominated in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars with floating interest rates, in principal amounts ranging from $38 million to $600 million. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining maturities of all bank loans outstanding ranged from 20 days to approximately 6.0 years. The weighted average remaining maturities on all bank loans was 2.1 years as of September 30, 2016.  
 Our bank loans contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and asset sales, and a financial covenant that requires us to maintain positive consolidated tangible net worth. In addition to other customary events of default, the bank loans include cross-default provisions and provisions for default if HMC does not maintain ownership, whether directly or indirectly, of at least 80% of the outstanding capital stock of AHFC or HCFI, as applicable. All of these covenants and events of default are subject to important limitations and exceptions under the agreements governing the bank loans. As of September 30, 2016, management believes that AHFC and HCFI were in compliance with all covenants contained in our bank loans.  
 Medium Term Note (MTN) Programs  
 Private MTN Program  
 AHFC no longer issues MTNs under the Rule 144A Private MTN Program. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining maturities of Private MTNs outstanding ranged from 151 days to approximately 5.0 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of Private MTNs was 2.1 years as of September 30, 2016. Interest rates on outstanding Private MTNs were fixed. Private MTNs were issued pursuant to the terms of an issuing and paying agency agreement which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of defaults. As of September 30, 2016, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Private MTNs.  
 Public MTN Program  
 AHFC is a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules and issues Public MTNs pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC. In August 2016, AHFC filed a registration statement with the SEC under which it may issue from time to time up to $30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Public MTNs. During fiscal year 2016, AHFC began issuing foreign currency denominated notes into international markets under this program. The aggregate principal amount of MTNs offered under this program may be increased from time to time. 
 The Public MTNs may have original maturities of 9 months or more from the date of issue, may be interest bearing with either fixed or floating interest rates, or may be discounted notes. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, AHFC issued $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of U.S. dollar denominated MTNs, with an original maturity ranging from 3.0 years to 10.0 years, bearing interest at fixed and floating rates. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining maturities of all Public MTNs outstanding ranged from 7 days to approximately 9.9 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of all Public MTNs was 2.6 years as of September 30, 2016. 
 The Public MTNs are issued pursuant to an indenture, which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions and restrictions on AHFC s ability to merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of its assets or the assets of its subsidiaries, and includes customary events of default. As of September 30, 2016, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants under the indenture.  
 Euro MTN Programme  
 The Euro MTN Programme was retired in August 2014. Notes under this program that are currently listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange will remain listed through their maturity. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining maturities of Euro MTNs outstanding under this program ranged from 112 days to approximately 6.4 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of all Euro MTNs was 2.7 years as of September 30, 2016. Interest rates on outstanding Euro MTNs are fixed or floating. Euro MTNs were issued pursuant to the terms of an agency agreement which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of default. As of September 30, 2016, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Euro MTNs.

Other Debt  
 HCFI issues privately placed Canadian dollar denominated notes. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, HCFI entered into two private placement trades for an aggregate of C$600 million ($457 million). As of September 30, 2016, the remaining maturities of all of HCFI s Canadian notes outstanding ranged from 189 days to approximately 5.2 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of these notes was 2.6 years as of September 30, 2016.  
 The notes are issued pursuant to the terms of an indenture, which requires HCFI to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of default. As of September 30, 2016, management believes that HCFI was in compliance with all covenants contained in the privately placed notes.    
 Secured Debt  
 Asset-Backed Securities  
 We enter into securitization transactions for funding purposes. Securitization transactions involve transferring pools of retail loans to trusts. The trusts are special-purpose entities that we establish to accommodate securitization structures. Securitization trusts have the limited purpose of acquiring assets, issuing asset-backed securities, and making payments on the securities. Assets transferred to securitization trusts are considered to be legally isolated from us and the claims of our creditors. We continue to service the retail loans transferred to the trusts. Investors in the notes issued by a trust only have recourse to the assets of such trust and do not have recourse to AHFC, HCFI, or our other subsidiaries or to other trusts.  
 Our securitizations are structured to provide credit enhancements to investors in the notes issued by the trusts. Credit enhancements can include the following:  

Subordinated certificates   which are securities issued by the trusts that are retained by us and are subordinated in priority of payment to the notes.      

Overcollateralization   which occurs when the principal balance of securitized assets exceed the balance of securities issued by the trust.      

Excess interest   which allows excess interest collections to be used to cover losses on defaulted loans.      

Reserve funds   which are restricted cash accounts held by the trusts to cover shortfalls in payments of interest and principal required to be paid on the notes.      

Yield supplement accounts   which are restricted cash accounts held by the trusts to supplement interest payments on notes.      

 We are required to consolidate the securitization trusts in our financial statements, which results in the securitizations being accounted for as on-balance sheet secured financings. The securitized receivables remain on our consolidated balance sheet along with the notes issued by the trusts. The notes are secured solely by the assets of the applicable trust and not by any of our other assets or those of other trusts. The assets of a trust are the only source of funds for repayment on the notes of such trust.  
 During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we issued notes through asset-backed securitizations totaling $3.4 billion, which were secured by consumer finance receivables with an initial principal balance of $3.5 billion.

Credit Agreements   
 Syndicated Bank Credit Facilities 
 AHFC maintains a $3.5 billion 364 day credit agreement, as amended, which expires on March 3, 2017, and a $3.5 billion five-year credit agreement, as amended, which expires on March 7, 2021. At September 30, 2016, no amounts were drawn upon under the AHFC credit agreements. AHFC intends to renew or replace the credit agreements prior to or on their respective expiration dates.  
 HCFI maintains a C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) credit agreement, as amended, which provides that HCFI may borrow up to C$800 million ($609 million) on a one-year and a five-year revolving basis. The one-year tranche of the credit agreement expires on March 24, 2017 and the five-year tranche of the credit agreement expires on March 24, 2021. At September 30, 2016, no amounts were drawn upon under the HCFI credit agreement. HCFI intends to renew or replace the credit agreement prior to or on the expiration date of each respective tranche.  
 The credit agreements contain customary conditions to borrowing and customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens and limitations on mergers, consolidations and asset sales. The credit agreements also require AHFC and HCFI, respectively, to maintain a positive consolidated tangible net worth as defined in their respective credit agreements. The credit agreements, in addition to other customary events of default, include cross-default provisions and provisions for default if HMC does not maintain ownership, whether directly or indirectly, of at least 80% of the outstanding capital stock of AHFC or HCFI, as applicable. In addition, the AHFC and HCFI credit agreements contain provisions for default if HMC s obligations under the HMC-AHFC Keep Well Agreement or the HMC-HCFI Keep Well Agreement, as applicable, become invalid, voidable, or unenforceable. All of these conditions, covenants and events of default are subject to important limitations and exceptions under the agreements governing the credit agreements. As of September 30, 2016, management believes that AHFC and HCFI were in compliance with all covenants contained in the respective credit agreements.  
 Other Credit Agreements 
 AHFC maintains other committed lines of credit that allow it access to an additional $1.0 billion in unsecured funding with multiple banks. The credit agreements contain customary covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and asset sales and a requirement for AHFC to maintain a positive consolidated tangible net worth. At September 30, 2016, no amounts were drawn upon under these agreements. These agreements expire in September 2017. AHFC intends to renew these credit agreements prior to or on their expiration dates. 
 Keep Well Agreements  
 HMC has entered into separate Keep Well Agreements with AHFC and HCFI. Pursuant to the Keep Well Agreements, HMC has agreed to, among other things:  

own and hold, at all times, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of each of AHFC s and HCFI s issued and outstanding shares of voting stock and not pledge, directly or indirectly, encumber, or otherwise dispose of any such shares or permit any of HMC s subsidiaries to do so, except to HMC or wholly-owned subsidiaries of HMC;      

cause each of AHFC and HCFI to, on the last day of each of AHFC s and HCFI s respective fiscal years, have a positive consolidated tangible net worth (with  tangible net worth  meaning (a) shareholders  equity less (b) any intangible assets, as determined in accordance with GAAP with respect to AHFC and generally accepted accounting principles in Canada with respect to HCFI); and      

ensure that, at all times, each of AHFC and HCFI has sufficient liquidity and funds to meet their payment obligations under any Debt (with  Debt  defined as AHFC s or HCFI s debt, as applicable, for borrowed money that HMC has confirmed in writing is covered by the respective Keep Well Agreement) in accordance with the terms of such Debt, or where necessary, HMC will make available to AHFC or HCFI, as applicable, or HMC will procure for AHFC or HCFI, as applicable, sufficient funds to enable AHFC or HCFI, as applicable, to pay its Debt in accordance with its terms. AHFC or HCFI Debt does not include the notes issued by securitization trusts in connection with AHFC s or HCFI s secured financing transactions, any related party debt or any indebtedness outstanding as of September 30, 2016 under AHFC s and HCFI s bank loan agreements.      

 As consideration for HMC s obligations under the Keep Well Agreements, we have agreed to pay HMC a quarterly fee based on the amount of outstanding Debt pursuant to support compensation agreements, dated October 1, 2005. We incurred expenses of $5 million during both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $10 million and $9 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, pursuant to these support compensation agreements. 
 45 

Indebtedness of Consolidated Subsidiaries   
 As of September 30, 2016, AHFC and its consolidated subsidiaries had $56.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities, including current liabilities, of which $14.9 billion consisted of indebtedness and liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries. None of AHFC s consolidated subsidiaries had any outstanding preferred equity.  
 Derivatives  
 We utilize derivative instruments to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The types of derivative instruments include interest rate swaps, basis swaps, and cross currency swaps. Interest rate and basis swap agreements are used to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations of our floating rate debt relative to our fixed rate finance receivables and operating lease assets. Cross currency swap agreements are used to manage currency and interest rate risk exposure on foreign currency denominated debt. The derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk in the event the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements.  
 All derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities, and carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in our consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Since we do not elect to apply hedge accounting, the impact to earnings resulting from these valuation adjustments as reported under GAAP is not representative of our results of operations as evaluated by management. Realized gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of realized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated debt, are included in the measure of net revenues when we evaluate segment performance. Refer to Note 14 Segment Information of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  for additional information about segment information and Note 5 Derivative Instruments of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  for additional information on derivative instruments. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 We are not a party to off-balance sheet arrangements.  
 Contractual Obligations  
 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations, excluding lending commitments to dealers and derivative obligations, for the periods indicated: 

(1)   
 
 Debt obligations reflect the remaining principal obligations of our outstanding debt and do not reflect unamortized debt discounts and fees. Repayment schedule of secured debt reflects payment performance assumptions on underlying receivables. Foreign currency denominated debt principal is based on exchange rates as of September 30, 2016.     

(2)   
 
 Interest payments on floating rate and foreign currency denominated debt based on the applicable floating rates and/or exchange rates as of September 30, 2016.       

 The obligations in the above table do not include certain lending commitments to dealers since the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  for additional information on these commitments.  
 Our contractual obligations on derivative instruments are also excluded from the table above because our future cash obligations under these contracts are inherently uncertain. We recognize all derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The amounts recognized as fair value do not represent the amounts that will be ultimately paid or received upon settlement under these contracts. Refer to Note 5 Derivative Instruments of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  for additional information on derivative instruments.  
 46 

New Accounting Standards   
 Refer to Note 1(c) Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Note 1(d) Recently Issued Accounting Standards of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).   
 Critical Accounting Policies  
 Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that require the application of our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often requiring us to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods, or for which the use of different estimates that could have reasonably been used in the current period would have had a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations are discussed throughout   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation   where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results. Different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in additional changes to the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the determination of lease residual values.  
 Credit Losses  
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses for management s estimate of probable losses incurred on our finance receivables. We also maintain an estimate for early termination losses on operating lease assets due to lessee defaults and an allowance for credit losses on past due operating lease rental payments. These estimates are evaluated by management, at minimum, on a quarterly basis.  
 Consumer finance receivables are collectively evaluated for impairment. Delinquencies and losses are monitored on an ongoing basis and this historical experience provides the primary basis for estimating the allowance. Management utilizes various methodologies when estimating the allowance for credit losses including models which incorporate vintage loss and delinquency migration analysis. These models take into consideration attributes of the portfolio, including loan-to-value ratios, internal and external credit scores, and collateral types. Market and economic factors such as used vehicle prices, unemployment rates, and consumer debt service burdens are also incorporated into these models. Estimated losses on operating leases expected to terminate early due to lessee defaults are also determined collectively, consistent with the methodologies used for consumer finance receivables.  
 Dealer finance receivables are individually evaluated for impairment when specifically identified as impaired. Dealer finance receivables are considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the loan. Our determination of whether dealer loans are impaired is based on evaluations of dealership payment history, financial condition, and cash flows, and their ability to perform under the terms of the loans. Dealer loans that have not been specifically identified as impaired are collectively evaluated for impairment.  
 Refer to Note 2 Finance Receivables of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  for additional information regarding charge-offs or write-downs of contractual balances of retail and dealer finance receivables. 
 Our allowance for credit losses and early termination losses on operating leases requires significant judgment about inherently uncertain factors. The estimates are based on management s evaluation of many factors, including our historical credit loss experience, the value of the underlying collateral, delinquency trends, and economic conditions. The estimates are based on information available as of each reporting date. Actual losses may differ from the original estimates due to actual results varying from those assumed in our estimates. Refer to Note 3 Investment in Operating Leases of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)  for additional information. 
 Sensitivity Analysis  
 If we had experienced a 10% increase in net charge-offs of finance receivables during the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016, our provision for credit losses would have increased by approximately $26 million during the period. Similarly, if we had experienced a 10% increase in realized losses on the disposition of repossessed operating lease vehicles during the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016, we would have recognized an additional $12 million in early termination losses in our consolidated statement of income during the period.  
 47 

Determination of Lease Residual Values   
 Contractual residual values of lease vehicles are determined at lease inception based on expectations of future used vehicle values, taking into consideration external industry data and our own historical experience. Lease customers have the option at the end of the lease term to return the vehicle to the dealer or to buy the vehicle at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance). Returned lease vehicles can be purchased by the grounding dealer at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance) or a market based price. Returned lease vehicles that are not purchased by the grounding dealer are sold through online and physical auctions. We are exposed to risk of loss on the disposition of returned lease vehicles when the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles are less than the contractual residual values at the end of lease term. We assess our estimates for end of term market values of the leased vehicles, at minimum, on a quarterly basis. The primary factors affecting the estimates are the percentage of leased vehicles that we expect to be returned by the lessee at the end of lease term and the expected loss severity. Factors considered in this evaluation include, among other factors, economic conditions, historical trends and market information on new and used vehicles.  
 For operating leases, adjustments to estimated residual values are made on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of each lease and are included as depreciation expense. For direct financing leases, downward adjustments for declines in estimated residual values deemed to be other-than-temporary are recognized as a loss on lease residual values in the period in which the estimate changed. 
 Sensitivity Analysis  
 If future estimated auction values for all outstanding operating leases as of September 30, 2016 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our current estimates, the total impact would be an increase of approximately $63 million in depreciation expense, which would be recognized over the remaining lease terms. If future return rates for all operating leases were to increase by one percentage point from our current estimates, the total impact would be an increase of approximately $9 million in depreciation expense, which would be recognized over the remaining lease terms. This sensitivity analysis may be asymmetric and is specific to the conditions in effect as of September 30, 2016. Additionally, any declines in auction values are likely to have a negative effect on return rates which could affect the severity of the impact on our results of operations.

     Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016, and each has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
