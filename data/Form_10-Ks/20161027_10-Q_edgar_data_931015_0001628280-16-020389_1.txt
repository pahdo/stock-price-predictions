POLARIS INDUSTRIES INC.  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
  Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies  
  Basis of presentation.   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Polaris Industries Inc. ( Polaris  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial statements and, therefore, do not include all information and disclosures of results of operations, financial position and changes in cash flow in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. Accordingly, such statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In the opinion of management, such statements reflect all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. Due to the seasonality of snowmobiles; Off-Road Vehicles (ORV), which include all-terrain vehicles (ATV) and side-by-side vehicles; motorcycles; Global Adjacent Markets vehicles; and related Parts, Garments and Accessories (PG A), and to certain changes in production and shipping cycles, results of such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the complete year.  
  Fair value measurements.   Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date:  
  Level  1     Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
  Level  2     Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  
  Level 3     Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
  In making fair value measurements, observable market data must be used when available. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its non-qualified deferred compensation assets and liabilities, and the income approach for foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities, and for the income approach the Company uses significant other observable inputs to value its derivative instruments used to hedge foreign currency and commodity transactions.  
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

Fair value of other financial instruments.   The carrying values of the Company s short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and short-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt, capital lease obligations and notes payable, approximate their fair values. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the Company s long-term debt was approximately $  457,746,000   and   $477,936,000  , respectively, and was determined using Level 2 inputs, including quoted market prices or discounted cash flows based on quoted market rates for similar types of debt. The carrying value of long-term debt, including current maturities, was   $436,712,000   and   $461,476,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Inventories.   Inventory costs include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, including depreciation expense associated with the manufacture and distribution of the Company s products. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. The major components of inventories are as follows (in thousands): 

Product warranties.   Polaris provides a limited warranty for its ORVs for a period of   six   months, for a period of   one   year for its snowmobiles, for a period of   one   or   two   years for its motorcycles depending on brand and model year, for a period of   one   year for its Taylor-Dunn vehicles and for a   two   year period for its GEM, Goupil and Aixam vehicles. Polaris provides longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions and may also provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs. Polaris  standard warranties require the Company or its dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. The warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor based on management s best estimate using historical rates and trends. Adjustments to the warranty reserve are made from time to time as actual claims become known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors that could have an impact on the warranty accrual in any given period include the following: change in manufacturing quality, shifts in product mix, changes in warranty coverage periods, snowfall and its impact on snowmobile usage, product recalls and any significant changes in sales volume. The activity in the warranty reserve during the periods presented was as follows (in thousands):  

During 2016, the Company has incurred significant additions to the warranty reserve, primarily associated with recall activity for certain   RZR   ORVs. In April 2016, the Company issued a voluntary recall for certain   RZR   900 and 1000 off-road vehicles manufactured since model year 2013 due to reports of thermal-related incidents, including fire, and in September 2016, the Company issued a voluntary recall for certain   RZR   XP Turbo off-road vehicles due to similar thermal-related incidents.     
  In 2016, Polaris began financing its self-insured risks related to extended service contracts. The premiums for extended service contracts are primarily recognized in income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. The unamortized extended service contract premiums (deferred revenue), recorded primarily in other long-term liabilities, totaled $  11,300,000   and   $0   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  New accounting pronouncements.  
  Debt issuance costs.   In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-230) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . The amendment requires that debt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than as an asset. The amendment is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this amendment during the first quarter

     Table of Contents  

of 2016, which caused the Company to reclassify   $1,803,000   of debt issuance costs as a reduction from long-term debt rather than as a component of prepaid expenses and other assets, as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Share-based payment accounting.   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, and statement of cash flow classification. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new standard on the financial statements. 
  Leases.   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . This ASU requires most lessees to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities, but recognize expenses in a manner similar with current accounting standards. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new standard on the financial statements. 
  Revenue from contracts with customers.   In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue from the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is evaluating the application method and the impact of this new standard on the financial statements. 
  There are no other new accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on Polaris  consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2. Share-Based Compensation  
  The amount of compensation cost for share-based awards to be recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The Company estimates stock option forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company analyzes historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and records share-based compensation expense for those awards expected to vest.  
  Total share-based compensation expenses were comprised as follows (in thousands): 

In addition to the above share-based compensation expenses, Polaris sponsors a qualified non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). Shares allocated to eligible participants  accounts vest at various percentage rates based on years of service and require no cash payments from the recipient. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $100,038,000   of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested share-based equity awards. Unrecognized share-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.83   years. Included in unrecognized share-based compensation is approximately   $38,833,000   related to stock options and   $61,205,000   for restricted stock.

Note 3. Financing Agreements 
  The carrying value of debt, capital lease obligations, notes payable and the average related interest rates were as follows (in thousands): 

In August 2011, Polaris entered into a   $350,000,000   unsecured revolving loan facility. In March 2015, Polaris amended the loan facility to increase the facility to   $500,000,000   and to provide more beneficial covenant and interest rate terms. The amended terms also extended the expiration date to March 2020. Interest is charged at rates based on a LIBOR or  prime  base rate. In May 2016, Polaris amended the revolving loan facility to increase the facility to   $600,000,000   and extend the expiration date to   May 2021  . The amended terms also established a   $500,000,000     12  -month delayed draw term loan facility, of which   $100,000,000   is outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  In December 2010, the Company entered into a Master Note Purchase Agreement to issue   $25,000,000   of unsecured senior notes due   May 2018   and   $75,000,000   of unsecured senior notes due   May 2021   (collectively, the  Senior Notes ). The Senior Notes were issued in   May 2011  . In December 2013, the Company entered into a First Supplement to Master Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Company issued   $100,000,000   of unsecured senior notes due   December 2020  .  
  The unsecured revolving loan facility and the Master Note Purchase Agreement contain covenants that require Polaris to maintain certain financial ratios, including minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios. Polaris was in compliance with all such covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The debt issuance costs are recognized as a reduction in the carrying value of the related long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income over the expected remaining terms of the related debt.  
  A property lease agreement for a manufacturing facility which Polaris began occupying in Opole, Poland commenced in February 2014. The Poland property lease is accounted for as a capital lease.  
  In January 2015, the Company announced plans to build a new production facility in Huntsville, Alabama to provide additional capacity and flexibility, and focus on ORV and Slingshot        production. Construction of the   725,000   square-foot facility was completed during the second quarter of 2016, with start-of-production also occurring during the second quarter. A mortgage note payable agreement of $  14,500,000   for land, on which Polaris built the facility, commenced in February 2015. The payment of principal and interest for the note payable is forgivable if the Company satisfies certain job commitments over the term of the note. Forgivable loans related to other Company facilities are also included within notes payable. 

Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
  Goodwill and other intangible assets, net, consisted of   $162,265,000   of goodwill and   $109,154,000   of intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Additions to goodwill and other intangible assets relate to acquisitions, primarily the March 2016 acquisition of Taylor-Dunn Manufacturing Company ( Taylor-Dunn ), a leading provider of industrial vehicles serving a broad range of commercial, manufacturing, warehouse and ground-support customers. Taylor-Dunn is based in Anaheim, California, and is included in the Global Adjacent Markets reporting segment.

     Table of Contents  

For the acquisition, the aggregate purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Taylor-Dunn financial results are included in the Company s consolidated results from the date of acquisition. Pro forma financial results are not presented as the acquisition is not material to the consolidated financial statements. As of   September 30, 2016  , the purchase price allocation for the acquisition remains preliminary.  
  In April 2015, the Company acquired Timbersled Products, Inc. ( Timbersled ) and HH Investment Limited ( Hammerhead ). Timbersled is based in Idaho and is an innovator and market leader in the burgeoning snow bike industry. Hammerhead is based in Shanghai, China and manufactures gasoline powered go-karts, light utility vehicles, and electric utility vehicles. Hammerhead markets its products globally under the Hammerhead Offroad        brand, along with maintaining key private label relationships with other original equipment manufacturers. In December 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of 509, Inc. ( 509 ). 509 is based in Washington and is an aftermarket leader in snowmobile helmets and goggles. As of   September 30, 2016  , the purchase price allocation for 509 remains preliminary.

Note 5. Shareholders  Equity  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Polaris paid   $154,381,000   to repurchase and retire approximately   1,803,000   shares of its common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional   8,568,000   shares of Polaris stock. The repurchase of any or all such shares authorized for repurchase will be governed by applicable SEC rules and dependent on management s assessment of market conditions. Polaris paid a regular cash dividend of   $0.55   per share on   September 15, 2016   to holders of record at the close of business on   September 1, 2016  . On   October 27, 2016  , the Polaris Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of   $0.55   per share payable on   December 15, 2016   to holders of record of such shares at the close of business on   December 1, 2016  . Cash dividends declared per common share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were as follows:    

Net income per share 
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period, including shares earned under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors ( Director Plan ), the ESOP and deferred stock units under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan ( Omnibus Plan ). Diluted earnings per share is computed under the treasury stock method and is calculated to compute the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options issued under the 1995 Stock Option Plan (the  Option Plan ) and certain shares issued under the Omnibus Plan. A reconciliation of these amounts is as follows (in thousands):  

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the number of options that could potentially dilute earnings per share on a fully diluted basis that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share (because to do so would have been anti-dilutive) were   1,786,000   and   1,736,000  , respectively, compared to   1,087,000   and   971,000   for the same periods in   2015  .  
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss 
  Changes in the accumulated other comprehensive loss balance is as follows (in thousands):  

The table below provides data about the amount of gains and losses, net of tax, reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the income statement for cash flow derivatives designated as hedging instruments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

The net amount of the existing gains or losses at   September 30, 2016   that is expected to be reclassified into the income statement within the next 12 months is not expected to be material. See Note 9 for further information regarding Polaris  derivative activities. 

Note 6. Financial Services Arrangements  
  Polaris Acceptance, a joint venture between Polaris and Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance, a direct subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ( Wells Fargo ), which is supported by a partnership agreement between their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, finances substantially all of Polaris  United States sales whereby Polaris receives payment within a few days of shipment of the product. On March 1, 2016, Wells Fargo announced that it completed the purchase of the North American portion of GE Capital s Commercial Distribution Finance (GECDF) business, including GECDF s ownership interests in Polaris Acceptance. Effective March 1, 2016, GECDF adopted the tradename Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance. 
  Polaris  subsidiary has a   50 percent   equity interest in Polaris Acceptance. Polaris Acceptance sells a majority of its receivable portfolio to a securitization facility (the  Securitization Facility ) arranged by Wells Fargo. The sale of receivables from Polaris Acceptance to the Securitization Facility is accounted for in Polaris Acceptance s financial statements as a  true-sale  under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860. Polaris  allocable share of the income of Polaris Acceptance has been included as a component of income from financial services in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The partnership agreement is effective through February 2022. 
  Polaris  total investment in Polaris Acceptance of   $92,203,000   at   September 30, 2016   is accounted for under the equity method, and is recorded in investment in finance affiliate in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding amount of net receivables financed for dealers under this arrangement was   $1,246,265,000  , which included   $486,280,000   in the Polaris Acceptance portfolio and   $759,985,000   of receivables within the Securitization Facility ( Securitized Receivables ). 
  Polaris has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by Polaris Acceptance up to an annual maximum of   15 percent   of the aggregate average month-end outstanding Polaris Acceptance receivables and Securitized Receivables during the prior calendar year. For calendar year   2016  , the potential   15 percent   aggregate repurchase obligation is approximately   $182,814,000  . Polaris  financial exposure under this arrangement is limited to the difference between the amounts unpaid by the dealer with respect to the repossessed product plus costs of repossession and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product. No material losses have been incurred under this agreement during the periods presented. 
  Polaris has agreements with Performance Finance, Sheffield Financial and Synchrony Bank, under which these financial institutions provide financing to end consumers of Polaris products. Polaris  income generated from these agreements has been included as a component of income from financial services in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
  Polaris also administers and provides extended service contracts to consumers and certain insurance contracts to dealers and consumers through various third-party suppliers. Polaris finances its self-insured risks related to extended service contracts, but does not retain any insurance or financial risk under any of the other arrangements. Polaris  service fee income generated from these arrangements has been included as a component of income from financial services in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  

Note 7. Investment in Other Affiliates  
  The Company has certain investments in nonmarketable securities of strategic companies. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these investments are comprised of investments in Eicher-Polaris Private Limited (EPPL) and Brammo, Inc. (Brammo) and are recorded as components of other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  EPPL is a joint venture established in 2012 with Eicher Motors Limited ( Eicher ). Polaris and Eicher each control   50 percent   of the joint venture, which is intended to design, develop and manufacture a full range of new vehicles for India and  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

other emerging markets. The investment in EPPL is accounted for under the equity method, with Polaris  proportionate share of income or loss recorded within the consolidated financial statements on a   one   month lag due to financial information not being available timely. At the time of the establishment of the joint venture, the overall investment was expected to be approximately   $50,000,000  , shared equally with Eicher over a   three   year period. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the Company s investment in EPPL was   $20,196,000   and   $18,884,000  , respectively. Through   September 30, 2016  , Polaris has invested   $41,560,000   in the joint venture. Polaris  share of EPPL loss for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1,798,000   and   $5,439,000  , respectively, compared to   $1,345,000   and   $4,716,000   for the same respective periods in   2015  . The loss is included in equity in loss of other affiliates on the consolidated statements of income.  
  Brammo is a privately held designer and developer of electric powertrains, which Polaris has invested in since 2011. The investment in Brammo is accounted for under the cost method. Brammo is in the early stages of designing, developing, and selling electric vehicle powertrains. As such, a risk exists that Brammo may not be able to secure sufficient financing to reach viability through cash flow from operations. In January 2015, Polaris acquired the electric motorcycle business from Brammo, and also made an additional investment in the remaining Brammo business, which will continue to be a designer and developer of electric vehicle powertrains. 
  Polaris will impair or write off an investment and recognize a loss if and when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other-than-temporary. When necessary, Polaris evaluates investments in nonmarketable securities for impairment, utilizing level 3 fair value inputs. No impairments were recognized on currently held investments for the three or nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  

Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies  
  Polaris is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business. In late 2012, Polaris purchased excess insurance coverage for catastrophic product liability claims for incidents occurring after the policy date. Polaris self-insures product liability claims before the policy date and up to the purchased catastrophic insurance coverage after the policy date. The estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable. The Company utilizes historical trends and actuarial analysis tools, along with an analysis of current claims, to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had an accrual of   $37,505,000   for the probable payment of pending claims related to product liability litigation associated with Polaris products. This accrual is included as a component of other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  Polaris is a defendant in lawsuits and subject to other claims arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, it is unlikely that any legal proceedings pending against or involving Polaris will have a material adverse effect on Polaris  financial position or results of operations.  
  As a component of certain past acquisition agreements, Polaris has committed to make additional payments to certain sellers contingent upon either the passage of time or certain financial performance criteria. Polaris initially records the fair value of each commitment as of the respective opening balance sheet, and each reporting period the fair value is evaluated, using level 3 inputs, with the change in value reflected in the consolidated statements of income. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of contingent purchase price commitments are immaterial.  

Note 9. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities    
  The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. From time to time, the primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price fluctuations. Derivative contracts on various currencies are entered into in order to manage foreign currency exposures associated with certain product sourcing activities and intercompany cash flows. Interest rate swaps are entered into in order to maintain a balanced risk of fixed and floating interest rates associated with the Company s long-term debt. Commodity hedging contracts are entered into in order to manage fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodities and raw materials that are integrated into the Company s end products. 
  The Company s foreign currency management objective is to mitigate the potential impact of currency fluctuations on the value of its U.S. dollar cash flows and to reduce the variability of certain cash flows at the subsidiary level. The Company actively manages certain forecasted foreign currency exposures and uses a centralized currency management operation to take advantage of potential opportunities to naturally offset foreign currency exposures against each other. The decision of whether and when to execute derivative instruments, along with the duration of the instrument, can vary from period to period depending on market conditions, the relative costs of the instruments and capacity to hedge. The duration is linked to  
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

the timing of the underlying exposure, with the connection between the two being regularly monitored. Polaris does not use any financial contracts for trading purposes.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , Polaris had the following open foreign currency contracts (in thousands): 

These contracts, with maturities through   December 31, 2017  , met the criteria for cash flow hedges and the unrealized gains or losses, after tax, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders  equity. 
  The table below summarizes the carrying values of derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Assets are included in prepaid expenses and other and liabilities are included in other accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
     For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the income statement. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in the current income statement.  
  The amount of gains (losses), net of tax, related to the effective portion of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2,638,000   and   $(4,621,000)  , respectively, compared to   $3,332,000   and   $3,563,000   for the same respective periods in   2015  . 
  See Note 5 for information about the amount of gains and losses, net of tax, reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the income statement for derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments. The ineffective portion of foreign currency contracts was not material for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Note 10. Segment Reporting  
  The Company s reportable segments are based on the Company s method of internal reporting, which generally segregates the operating segments by product line, inclusive of wholegoods and PG A. The internal reporting of these operating segments is defined based, in part, on the reporting and review process used by the Company s Chief Executive Officer. The  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

Company has   four   operating segments: 1) ORV, 2) Snowmobiles, 3) Motorcycles, and 4) Global Adjacent Markets, and   three   reportable segments: 1) ORV/Snowmobiles, 2) Motorcycles, and 3) Global Adjacent Markets.  
  The ORV/Snowmobiles segment includes the aggregated results of our ORV and Snowmobiles operating segments. The Motorcycles and Global Adjacent Markets segments include the results for those respective operating segments. The Corporate amounts include costs that are not allocated to individual segments, which include incentive-based compensation and other unallocated manufacturing costs. Additionally, given the commonality of customers, manufacturing and asset management, the Company does not maintain separate balance sheets for each segment. Accordingly, the segment information presented below is limited to sales and gross profit data.  

Note 11. Subsequent Event  
  On   October 11, 2016  , the Company entered into a definitive agreement with TAP Automotive Holdings, LLC ( Transamerican Auto Parts ), to acquire the outstanding equity interests in Transamerican Auto Parts, a privately held, vertically integrated manufacturer, distributor, retailer and installer of off-road Jeep and truck accessories, for an aggregate consideration of   $665,000,000  , subject to customary closing adjustments. Headquartered in Compton, California, Transamerican Auto Parts has trailing 12 month sales of approximately   $740 million  , through September 2016. The completion of the acquisition is subject to receipt of regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. The Company expects to fund the purchase price with borrowings under its existing credit facilities.  

Item 2   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Overview  
  The following discussion pertains to the results of operations and financial position of Polaris Industries Inc., a Minnesota corporation, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  . The terms  Polaris,  the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our  as used herein refer to the business and operations of Polaris Industries Inc., its subsidiaries and its predecessors, which began doing business in the early 1950s. Due to the seasonality of snowmobiles; Off-Road Vehicles (ORV), which includes all-terrain vehicles (ATV) and side-by-side vehicles; motorcycles; Global Adjacent Markets vehicles; and related Parts, Garments and Accessories (PG A), and to certain changes in production and shipping cycles, results of such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the complete year. 
  We reported net income of   $32.3 million  , or   $0.50   per diluted share, an earnings per diluted share decrease of   78 percent   compared to   2015     third quarter   net income of   $155.2 million  , or   $2.30   per diluted share. Sales totaled   $1,185.1 million  , a decrease of   19   percent from last year s   third quarter   sales of   $1,456.0 million  . The sales decrease was driven primarily by lower shipments of ORV units due to our decision to delay model year 2017 shipments. Our unit retail sales to consumers in North America decreased nine percent in the   third quarter   of 2016, primarily driven by decreased demand for our off-road vehicles. Our sales to customers outside of North America decreased eight percent, driven by a 12 percent decrease in sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) region, partially offset by a three percent increase in sales in the Asia/Pacific region. Our gross profit of   $260.8 million   decreased   37 percent   from   $415.6 million   in the comparable prior year period. The  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from increased warranty and promotional costs and negative product mix, partially offset by lower commodity costs and product cost reduction efforts. Our liquidity remained healthy with   $122.7 million   of cash on hand and   $895.1 million   of combined availability, inclusive of both the revolving loan facility and the delayed draw term loan facility at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, on   October 11, 2016  , we entered into a definitive agreement with TAP Automotive Holdings, LLC ( Transamerican Auto Parts ), to acquire the outstanding equity interests in Transamerican Auto Parts, a privately held, vertically integrated manufacturer, distributor, retailer and installer of off-road Jeep        and truck accessories, for an aggregate consideration of   $665,000,000  , subject to customary closing adjustments. Headquartered in Compton, California, Transamerican Auto Parts has trailing 12 month sales of approximately $740 million, through September 2016. The completion of the acquisition is subject to receipt of regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. We expect to fund the purchase price with borrowings under our existing credit facilities.  

Results of Operations  
  Unless otherwise noted, all  quarter  comparisons are from the   third quarter   2016 to the   third quarter   2015, and all  year-to-date  comparisons are from the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 to the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. 
  Sales:  
  Quarter sales were   $1,185.1 million  , a   19   percent decrease from   $1,456.0 million   of quarter sales in the prior year. Year-to-date sales were   $3,298.8 million  , a   nine   percent decrease from   $3,613.7 million   of sales in the comparable prior year period. The following table is an analysis of the percentage change in total Company sales: 

Quarter and year-to-date volume decreased due to lower ORV shipments and negative product mix. The U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate, and overall strength of the U.S. dollar compared to other international currencies, negatively impacted our quarter and year-to-date sales by approximately $2.0 million and $23.0 million, respectively, when compared to the prior year period exchange rates. 
  Our sales by reporting segment, which includes the respective PG A, were as follows:  

ORV/Snowmobiles 
  ORVs:     Quarter and year-to-date sales, inclusive of PG A sales, decreased, which reflects negative impacts from recent recalls of certain products. During the quarter, we experienced additional   RZR        thermal-related issues and were unable to sufficiently validate the initially identified   RZR   Turbo recall repair, necessitating a more complex and expensive repair solution. As a result, the voluntary stop-ride/stop sale notification issued on July 25, 2016 remained in place significantly longer than originally anticipated, delaying sales of the   RZR   Turbo vehicle. Additionally, given the additional   RZR   thermal 
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

issues, we revalidated many of our recently introduced model year 2017 ORV products, causing a delay in shipments of those vehicles. Sales outside North America decreased 12 percent in the quarter, primarily due to the reduced shipments due to recent recall related shipment delays. The quarter average per unit sales price decreased eight percent.  
  Our North American ORV quarter unit retail sales to consumers were down high single-digits percent compared to the 2015 third quarter, with consumer purchases of side-by-side vehicles, which include   RANGER       ,   RZR,   and Polaris GENERAL       , down high-single digits percent  ,   and ATV retail sales down low-double digits percent over the prior year. The Company estimates that North American industry ORV retail sales were down low-single digits percent from the third quarter of 2015. Polaris  North American dealer unit inventory decreased 16 percent from the third quarter of 2015.  
  Snowmobiles:     Quarter and year-to-date sales, inclusive of PG A sales, decreased due to the timing of shipments for the upcoming snowmobile retail selling season, year-over-year, as we manufactured and shipped our snowmobiles earlier in 2015. Sales outside North America increased 27 percent in the quarter, primarily due to increased shipments in the EMEA region. The quarter average snowmobile per unit sales price increased five percent. 
  Motorcycles    
  Quarter sales, inclusive of PG A sales, decreased due to decreased shipments of Slingshot       , partially offset by increased shipments of Victory       and Indian Motorcycle       . Year-to-date sales, inclusive of PG A sales, increased due to increased shipments of all three motorcycle brands. Consumer North American retail sales for Victory, Indian Motorcycle, and Slingshot increased high-single digits percent for the quarter, while North American industry retail sales, 900cc and above, were down high-single digits percent in the quarter. Product availability for all three motorcycle brands remained adequate throughout the quarter as both the Spirit Lake, Iowa motorcycle plant and the new Slingshot production line in Huntsville, Alabama are producing at retail demand levels. Increased shipments of all three motorcycle brands including new models and new segments contributed to North American Polaris dealer inventory increasing approximately 70 percent, which is essentially at targeted stocking levels at quarter-end. Quarter sales, including PG A, to customers outside of North America decreased 11 percent due primarily to decreased Indian Motorcycle shipments. The quarter average per unit sales price decreased one percent.  
  Global Adjacent Markets 
  Quarter and year-to-date sales, including PG A sales, increased due primarily to the acquisition of Taylor-Dunn. The quarter average per unit sales price increased one percent.  
  Sales by Geography 
  Sales by geographic region were as follows:  

United States:     Quarter and year-to-date sales in the U.S. decreased due primarily to lower ORV shipments.  
  Canada:     Quarter and year-to-date sales in Canada decreased due to lower shipments of ORVs and weak economic conditions.  The U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate negatively impacted our year-to-date sales by approximately three percent.  
  Other foreign countries:     Quarter sales in other foreign countries decreased primarily due to lower ORV shipments, primarily in the EMEA region. Specifically for quarter segment sales, Motorcycles sales decreased 11 percent, ORV/Snowmobiles sales decreased eight percent, and Global Adjacent Markets sales decreased five percent. Year-to-date sales in other foreign countries increased primarily due to increased motorcycle shipments, partially offset by lower ORV shipments. Currency rate movements had a negative impact on sales of one and three percent, on quarter and year-to-date sales, respectively.

     Table of Contents  

Cost of Sales:     

The decrease in quarter and year-to-date cost of sales dollars resulted primarily from the decreased shipments, offset by higher warranty costs incurred related to product recalls. 
     Gross Profit:  

Consolidated  . Quarter gross profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased due to increased warranty and promotional costs and negative product mix, partially offset by lower commodity costs and product cost reduction efforts. During the quarter, we incurred additional warranty expense equating to approximately 490 basis points of negative impact to gross profit margins, related to increased warranty costs associated with vehicle recalls. Gross profit in absolute dollars decreased due to lower sales volume, unfavorable product mix, higher promotions and higher warranty costs, partially offset by lower commodity costs and cost savings from product cost reduction efforts.  
  ORV/Snowmobiles  . Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased for the quarter and year-to-date periods, primarily due to decreased volumes, higher warranty costs, and higher promotions, partially offset by product cost reduction efforts. Included in warranty expense incurred during the quarter and year-to-date periods are costs related to recent recall activity, primarily for certain   RZR   vehicles.  
  Motorcycles  . Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased for the quarter, primarily due to higher warranty costs associated with recent safety and service bulletin activity for Slingshot. Year-to-date gross profit, as a percentage of sales, increased due to increased sales volumes of all motorcycle brands, and due to the absence of costs incurred in 2015 related to additional manufacturing costs and inefficiencies associated with our Spirit Lake, Iowa motorcycle facility paint system, offset by higher warranty costs.  
  Global Adjacent Markets  . Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, increased for the quarter and year-to-date periods, primarily due to the acquisition of Taylor-Dunn and increased sales volumes of Aixam vehicles.  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

Operating Expenses:  

Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars, for the quarter and year-to-date periods increased primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses due to increased legal expenses and other costs related to product recalls. These costs were partially offset by operating cost control measures.  
  Income from Financial Services:  

The slight increase for the quarter in income from financial services is directly related to growth in certain retail financing programs, including extended service contracts, offset by lower retail sales and lower dealer inventory during the quarter. The year-to-date increase in income from financial services is due to higher penetration rates for retail financing programs. Further discussion can be found in the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section below.  
  Remainder of the Income Statement:  

Interest expense:   The quarter and year-to-date increase is primarily due to increases in debt levels through borrowings on our delayed-draw term facility during the comparative periods.  
  Equity in loss of other affiliates:   Quarter and year-to-date losses relate to continued operating activities at Eicher-Polaris Private Limited (EPPL). During the quarter, EPPL continued production of the jointly-developed Multix        personal vehicle, which is specifically designed to satisfy the varied transportation needs of consumers in India. We have recorded our proportionate 50 percent share of EPPL losses.  
  Other expense (income), net:   The quarter and year-to-date change primarily relates to foreign currency exchange rate movements and the corresponding effects on foreign currency transactions and balance sheet positions related to our foreign subsidiaries from period to period.   
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

Provision for income taxes:     The quarter and year-to-date tax rate decrease is primarily due to the extension of the research and development credit by the U.S. Congress in the fourth quarter of 2015, in addition to certain favorable tax adjustments in the 2016 third quarter that had a more significant impact on the income tax rate due to the lower pretax income generated during the quarter.  
  Weighted average shares outstanding:   Over the time period within and between the comparable quarter, weighted average shares outstanding decreased approximately four percent due primarily to share repurchases under our stock repurchase program.  
  Cash Dividends: 
  We paid a regular cash dividend of   $0.55   per share on   September 15, 2016   to holders of record at the close of business on   September 1, 2016  . On   October 27, 2016  , the Polaris Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of   $0.55   per share payable on   December 15, 2016   to holders of record of such shares at the close of business on   December 1, 2016  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary source of funds has been cash provided by operating and financing activities. Our primary uses of funds have been for acquisitions, repurchase and retirement of common stock, capital investment, new product development and cash dividends to shareholders. 
  We believe that existing cash balances and cash flow to be generated from operating activities and borrowing capacity under the credit facility arrangement will be sufficient to fund operations, new product development, cash dividends, share repurchases, the financing of the pending Transamerican Auto Parts acquisition and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. At this time, management is not aware of any factors that would have a material adverse impact on cash flow. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:   

  Operating activities:   The   $37.8 million   decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in   2016   is primarily the result of decreased net income, partially offset by decreased working capital required. The decrease in working capital for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   is $121.2 million. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our statements of cash flows) was a decrease of $130.7 million, compared to an decrease of $9.5 million for the same period in 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease in net cash used of $79.0 million related to inventory purchases, and a decrease in net cash used of $131.6 million related to payments made for accrued expenses due to our focused efforts on working capital required, partially offset by an increase in net cash used of $29.3 million related to payments made for accounts payable, and an increase in net cash used of $54.7 million for timing of payments made for income taxes payable/receivable.  
  Investing activities:   The primary use of cash was for the purchase of property and equipment, and acquisitions including Taylor-Dunn. We made large capital expenditures related to continued capacity and capability expansion at our manufacturing facilities, including the construction of our Huntsville, Alabama facility which was completed during the second quarter. We expect that capital expenditures for the full year 2016 will be slightly higher than 2015. 
  Financing activities:   Cash used for financing activities changed primarily due to net repayments under debt arrangements,  capital lease obligations and notes payable of   $28.0 million   compared to net borrowings of   $95.6 million   in the   2015   comparable period, and common stock repurchases of   $154.4 million   compared to   $247.8 million   in the   2015   comparable period. Additionally, we paid cash dividends of   $105.7 million   and   $104.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee plans were   $15.7 million   and   $26.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The seasonality of production and shipments cause working capital requirements to fluctuate during the year.

Debt and Capital 
  We are party to a $600 million variable interest rate bank lending agreement and a Master Note Purchase Agreement, as amended and supplemented, under which we have unsecured borrowings. We are also party to a $500 million 12-month delayed draw term loan facility, of which   $100 million   is outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  We enter into leasing arrangements to finance the use of certain property and equipment.  
  In January 2015, we announced plans to build a new production facility in Huntsville, Alabama to provide additional capacity and flexibility. The   725,000   square-foot facility focuses on ORV and Slingshot production. We broke ground on the facility in the first quarter of 2015, and completed construction during the second quarter of 2016, with start-of-production also occurring during the second quarter. A mortgage note payable agreement of $  14.5 million   for land, on which we are building the facility, commenced in February 2015. The payment of principal and interest for the note payable is forgivable if we satisfy certain job commitments over the term of the note. We expect to comply with the commitments.  
  Debt, capital lease obligations, notes payable, and the average related interest rates at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Our debt to total capital ratio was   32 percent   and   25 percent   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Additionally, at   September 30, 2016  , we had letters of credit outstanding of   $24.6 million   primarily related to purchase obligations for raw materials. 
  Share Repurchases 
  Our Board of Directors has authorized the cumulative repurchase of up to   86.5 million   shares of our common stock. Of that total, approximately   77.9 million   shares have been repurchased cumulatively from 1996 through   September 30, 2016  . We repurchased approximately   1.8 million   shares of our common stock for   $154.4 million   during the first   nine   months of   2016  , which had a favorable impact on earnings per share of   $0.04  . We have authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to an additional   8.6 million   shares of our common stock as of   September 30, 2016  . The repurchase of any or all such shares authorized remaining for repurchase will be governed by applicable SEC rules. 
  Other Financial Arrangements 
  Polaris Acceptance, a joint venture between Polaris and Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance ( WFCDF ), a direct subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ( Wells Fargo ), which is supported by a partnership agreement between their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, finances substantially all of Polaris  U.S. sales, whereby Polaris receives payment within a few days of shipment of the product. On March 1, 2016 Wells Fargo announced that it completed the purchase of the North American portion of GE Capital s Commercial Distribution Finance ( GECDF ) business, including GECDF s ownership interests in Polaris Acceptance. The partnership agreement is effective through February 2022. Effective March 1, 2016, GECDF adopted the tradename Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance. 
  Polaris Acceptance sells a majority of its receivables portfolio (the  Securitized Receivables ) to a securitization facility ( Securitization Facility ) arranged by Wells Fargo, a WFCDF affiliate. Polaris Acceptance is not responsible for any continuing servicing costs or obligations with respect to the Securitized Receivables. At   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding amount of net receivables financed for dealers under this arrangement, including Securitized Receivables, was   $1,246.3 million  , a   six percent   decrease from   $1,321.1 million   at   September 30, 2015  .

We account for our investment in Polaris Acceptance under the equity method. Polaris Acceptance is funded through equal equity cash investments from the partners and a loan from an affiliate of WFCDF. We do not guarantee the outstanding indebtedness of Polaris Acceptance. The partnership agreement provides that all income and losses of Polaris Acceptance are shared 50 percent by our wholly owned subsidiary and 50 percent by WFCDF s subsidiary. Our total investment in Polaris Acceptance at   September 30, 2016  , was   $92.2 million  . Our exposure to losses of Polaris Acceptance is limited to our equity in Polaris Acceptance. Credit losses in the Polaris Acceptance portfolio have been modest, averaging less than one percent of the portfolio. 
  We have agreed to repurchase products repossessed by Polaris Acceptance up to an annual maximum of 15 percent of the aggregate average month-end outstanding Polaris Acceptance receivables and Securitized Receivables during the prior calendar year. For calendar year 2016, the potential 15 percent aggregate repurchase obligation is approximately   $182.8 million  . Our financial exposure under this arrangement is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance company for repurchases and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product. No material losses have been incurred under this agreement. 
  See Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Polaris Acceptance. 
  We have agreements with certain financial institutions, under which these financial institutions provide financing to end consumers of our products in the United States. The income generated from these agreements has been included as a component of income from financial services in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. In September 2016, our new agreement with Performance Finance became effective, which replaces our previous agreement with Freedom Road. In September 2016, we also terminated our agreement with Chrome Capital. At   September 30, 2016  , the agreements in place were as follows:

Inflation and Foreign Exchange Rates 
  The changing relationships of the U.S. dollar to the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Euro and other foreign currencies have had a material impact on our results of operations from time to time. We actively manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates by entering into foreign exchange hedging contracts. 
  Japanese Yen:   During 2015, purchases totaling approximately two percent of our cost of sales were from yen-denominated suppliers. Fluctuations in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate primarily impact cost of sales and net income. 
  Mexican Peso:   With increased production at our Monterrey, Mexico facility, our costs in the Mexican peso have continued to increase. We also market and sell to customers in Mexico through a wholly owned subsidiary. Fluctuations in the peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate primarily impact sales, cost of sales, and net income. 
  Canadian Dollar:   We operate in Canada through a wholly owned subsidiary. The relationship of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Canadian dollar impacts both sales and net income. 
  Other currencies:   We operate in various countries, principally in Europe and Australia, through wholly owned subsidiaries and also sell to certain distributors in other countries. We also purchase components from certain suppliers directly for our U.S. operations in transactions denominated in the Euro and other foreign currencies. The relationship of the U.S. dollar in relation to these other currencies impacts each of sales, cost of sales and net income.

At   September 30, 2016  , we had the following open foreign currency hedging contracts for the remainder of 2016 and through   December 31, 2017  , and expect the following net currency impact on net income, after consideration of the existing foreign currency hedging contracts, when compared to the respective prior year periods:

In addition, we expect currencies to have an overall negative impact on 2016 results based on the current environment. 
  The assets and liabilities in all our foreign entities are translated at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Translation gains and losses are reflected as a component of  accumulated other comprehensive loss, net  in the shareholders  equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Revenues and expenses in all of our foreign entities are translated at the average foreign exchange rate in effect for each month of the quarter. Certain assets and liabilities related to intercompany positions reported on our consolidated balance sheet that are denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are translated at the foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the associated gains and losses are included in net income. 
  We are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodities and raw materials including steel, aluminum, petroleum-based resins, certain rare earth metals and diesel fuel. In addition, we are a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities, including steel, aluminum, rubber and others, which are integrated into the Company s end products. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. We generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process and from time to time will enter into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of the exposure to commodity risk. While we occasionally enter into these derivative contracts, at   September 30, 2016  , we do not have any open derivative contracts in place to hedge our diesel fuel exposure. Based on our current outlook for commodity prices, the total impact of commodities is expected to have a positive impact on our gross margins for the remainder of   2016   when compared to the same period in the prior year. 
  We are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a $600 million revolving loan facility and a $500 million 12-month delayed draw term loan facility. Interest accrues on the revolving loan at variable rates based on LIBOR or  prime  plus the applicable add-on percentage as defined in the agreement. At   September 30, 2016  , we had an outstanding balance of   $104.3 million   on the revolving loan, and an outstanding balance of   $100.0 million   on the delayed draw term loan.

Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements 
  Certain matters discussed in this report are  forward-looking statements  intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These  forward-looking statements,  including but not limited to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on sales and net income, and commodity price changes on gross margins, can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as the Company or management  believes,   anticipates,   expects,   estimates  or words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe the Company s future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may also be made from time to time in oral presentations, including telephone, conferences and/or webcasts open to the public. Shareholders, potential investors and others are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results in future periods to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made in this report, including the risks and uncertainties described under the heading titled  Item 1A-Risk Factors  appearing in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In addition to the factors discussed above, among the other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: product offerings, promotional activities and pricing strategies by competitors; acquisition integration costs; future conduct of litigation processes; product recalls and warranty expenses; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; commodity and transportation costs; environmental and product safety regulatory activity; effects of weather; uninsured product liability claims; uncertainty in the retail and wholesale credit markets and relationships with Performance Finance, Sheffield Financial and Synchrony Bank; changes in tax policy; and overall economic conditions, including inflation and consumer confidence and spending. The Company does not undertake any duty to any person to provide updates to its forward-looking statements. 

Item 3   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a complete discussion on the Company s market risk. There have been no material changes in market risk from those disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and its Executive Vice President   Finance and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President   Finance and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Changes in Internal Controls 
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.  

Part II OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  Item 1   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  We are involved in a number of legal proceedings incidental to our business, none of which is expected to have a material effect on the financial results of our business.  
  Class action lawsuit  . Since September 16, 2016, three investors have filed two purported class action complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota naming the Company and two of its executive officers as defendants. The plaintiff-investors seek to represent classes of persons who purchased or acquired Polaris securities during the time period from February 20, 2015 through September 11, 2016 ( class period ). The complaint alleges that, during the class period, defendants made materially false or misleading public statements about the Company s business, operations, and  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

compliance policies relating to   RZR   products and product-recalls. The complaint alleges claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and an award of attorneys  fees and expenses. Defendants have not yet responded to the complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend the action. 

Item 1A   RISK FACTORS 
  Except as provided below, there have been no material changes or additions to our risk factors discussed in our fiscal   2015   Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. Please consider the factors discussed in  Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  in such report, which could materially affect the Company s business, financial condition, or future results. 
  Significant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
  We provide a limited warranty for ORVs for a period of six months, for a period of one year for our snowmobiles, for a period of one or two years for our motorcycles depending on brand and model year, for a period of one year for its Taylor-Dunn vehicles, and for a two year period for GEM, Goupil and Aixam vehicles. We may provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs, as well as longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions. We also provide a limited emission warranty for certain emission-related parts in our ORVs, snowmobiles, and motorcycles as required by the EPA and CARB. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. 
  Historically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors. The repair and replacement costs we could incur in connection with a recall could adversely affect our business. For example, in April 2016, we issued a voluntary recall for certain RZR 900 and 1000 off-road vehicles manufactured since model year 2013 due to reports of thermal-related incidents, including fire, and in September 2016, we issued a voluntary recall for certain RZR XP Turbo off-road vehicles due to similar thermal-related incidents. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. 

Item 2   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

(1) The Board of Directors has authorized the cumulative repurchase of up to an aggregate of   86.5 million   shares of the Company s common stock (the  Program ). Of that total,   77.9 million   shares have been repurchased cumulatively from 1996 through   September 30, 2016  . The Program does not have an expiration date. 

Item 4   MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
