1.    Business 
  Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT I, Inc. (which may be referred to as the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) was incorporated in November 2004 as a Maryland corporation and has elected to be taxed, and currently qualifies, as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes. 
  We operate commercial real estate and real estate-related assets located in and outside the United States.  With our opportunistic and value-add investment strategy, we have focused generally on acquiring properties with significant possibilities for capital appreciation, such as those requiring development, redevelopment, or repositioning, or those located in markets and submarkets with higher volatility, lower barriers to entry, and high growth potential.  We have acquired a wide variety of properties, including office, retail, hospitality, recreation and leisure, multifamily, industrial, and other properties.  We have purchased existing and newly constructed properties and properties under development or construction.  As of September 30, 2016, we wholly owned   two   properties and consolidated   three   properties through investments in joint ventures on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  In addition, we have a noncontrolling, unconsolidated ownership interest in a joint venture consisting of   18   properties that is accounted for using the equity method.  Our investment properties are located in Colorado, Missouri, Texas, the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the Czech Republic, and Poland. 
  Substantially all of our business is conducted through Behringer Harvard Opportunity OP I, LP, a Texas limited partnership organized in November 2004 (the  Operating Partnership ), or its subsidiaries.  Our wholly owned subsidiary, BHO, Inc., a Delaware corporation, owns less than a   0.1%   interest in the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.  The remaining interest of the Operating Partnership is held as a limited partnership interest by our wholly owned subsidiary, BHO Business Trust, a Maryland business trust.   
  We are externally managed and advised by Behringer Harvard Opportunity Advisors I, LLC ( Behringer Harvard Opportunity Advisors I  or the  Advisor ), a Texas limited liability company.  Behringer Harvard Opportunity Advisors I is responsible for managing our day-to-day affairs and for identifying and making acquisitions, dispositions, and investments on our behalf. 
  On August 26, 2016, in connection with a review of potential strategic alternatives available to us, our board of directors unanimously approved a plan for the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution (the  Plan of Liquidation ).  The Company is in various stages of marketing all of its assets for sale and if the Plan of Liquidation is approved, it expects to market and dispose of its remaining assets within two years. Pursuant to our charter, the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the Plan of Liquidation is required for approval of the Plan of Liquidation.  We can provide no assurance that the Plan of Liquidation will be approved by our stockholders. 
  If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by our stockholders, we expect to make liquidating distribution payments to our stockholders after we sell all of our assets, pay all of our known liabilities, and provide for unknown liabilities.  We expect to complete these activities within 24 months after stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation; however, there can be no assurances regarding the amounts or timing of any liquidating distributions. 
  Presentation of Financial Statements  
  Our financial statements are presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  As is usual for opportunity-style real estate investment programs, we are structured as a finite-life entity.  As discussed above, our board of directors unanimously approved a plan for the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation.  If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by our stockholders, we expect to sell all of our assets, pay for all of our known liabilities, provide for unknown liabilities, and distribute the net proceeds from our liquidation to our stockholders.  There can be no assurances regarding the amounts or timing of any liquidating distributions.  We have experienced significant losses and may generate negative cash flows as mortgage note obligations and expenses exceed revenues.   If we are unable to sell a property when we determine to do so, it could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows that are necessary to meet our mortgage obligations and our ability to satisfy our other liabilities in the normal course of business. 
  Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to sell real estate investments, to pay down debt as it matures if extensions or new financings are unavailable, and our ability to fund ongoing costs of our Company, including our development and operating properties.

     Table of Contents  

If our stockholders approve the Plan of Liquidation, we anticipate we will change our basis of accounting from the going concern basis to the liquidation basis of accounting.  Under the liquidation basis of accounting, all of our assets must be stated at their estimated net realizable value and all of our liabilities must be recorded at the estimated amounts at which they are expected to be settled.  If our stockholders do not approve the Plan of Liquidation Proposal, we expect to continue to account for our assets and liabilities under the going concern basis of accounting. 

2.    Interim Unaudited Financial Information 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 18, 2016.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted in this report on Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
  The results for the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of future financial results.  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the condensed consolidated statements of equity and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have not been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to fairly present our condensed consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2016 and our condensed consolidated results of operations, equity, and cash flows for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Such adjustments are normal and recurring in nature. 
  As discussed in Note 6, Real Estate Investments, subheading Discontinued Operations, effective January 1, 2015, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) guidance that changes the criteria for reporting a discontinued operation.  This adoption impacts the comparability of our financial statements as disposals of individual operating properties will generally no longer qualify as discontinued operations. 

3.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Described below are certain of our significant accounting policies.  The disclosures regarding several of the policies have been condensed or omitted in accordance with interim reporting regulations specified by Form 10-Q.  Please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete listing of all of our significant accounting policies. 
  In the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, all dollar and share amounts in tabulation are in thousands of dollars and shares, respectively, unless otherwise noted. 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of other subsidiaries over which we have control.  All inter-company transactions, balances, and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.  Interests in entities acquired will be evaluated based on applicable GAAP, which includes the requirement to consolidate entities deemed to be variable interest entities ( VIE ) in which we are the primary beneficiary.  If the interest in the entity is determined not to be a VIE, then the entity will be evaluated for consolidation based on legal form, economic substance, and the extent to which we have control and/or substantive participating rights under the respective ownership agreement.  For entities in which we have less than a controlling interest or entities which we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, we account for the investment using the equity method of accounting. 
  There are judgments and estimates involved in determining if an entity in which we have made an investment is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.  The entity is evaluated to determine if it is a VIE by, among other things, calculating the percentage of equity being risked compared to the total equity of the entity.  Determining expected future losses involves assumptions of various possibilities of the results of future operations of the entity, assigning a probability to each possibility, and using a discount rate to determine the net present value of those future losses.  A change in the judgments, assumptions, and estimates outlined above could result in consolidating an entity that should not be consolidated or accounting for an investment using the equity method that should in fact be consolidated, the effects of which could be material to our financial statements.

Real Estate 
  We amortize the value of in-place leases, in-place tenant improvements, and in-place leasing commissions to expense over the initial term of the respective leases.  In no event does the amortization period for intangible assets or liabilities exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.  Should a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the acquired lease intangibles related to that tenant would be charged to expense.  As of September 30, 2016, all of our lease intangibles were fully amortized. 
  The value of hotels and all other buildings is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of   39 years   and   25 years  , respectively, using the straight-line method.  Accumulated depreciation and amortization related to our consolidated investments in real estate assets and intangibles were as follows (in thousands): 

______________________________________________ 
           (1)  
    Excludes Las Colinas Commons, which was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015.  Net book values included in assets associated with real estate held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet were buildings and improvements of   $8.3 million  , land and improvements of   $2.8 million  , and lease intangibles of   $0.7 million  .  See Note 7, Real Estate Held for Sale.  
     Real Estate Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 
  We classify properties as held for sale when certain criteria are met in accordance with GAAP.  Along with the criteria, management must determine if a sale is probable.  Criteria management considers in determining if a sale is probable include a signed purchase and sale agreement, completion of the due diligence period, and whether there is a significant monetary penalty incurred by the purchaser if the sale does not close.  At that time, we present the assets and obligations of the property held for sale separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and we cease recording depreciation and amortization expense related to that property.  Properties held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell.   
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement for Las Colinas Commons, an office building located in Texas, and classified the investment as real estate held for sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015.  The sales transaction closed on February 2, 2016.  The Company is in various stages of marketing all of its assets for sale and if the Plan of Liquidation is approved, it expects to market and dispose of its remaining assets within two years.  We did not have any properties classified as held for sale at September 30, 2016 as we determined that none of our assets meet the criteria that a sale is probable as discussed above. 
  Effective as of January 1, 2015, we adopted the revised guidance regarding discontinued operations.  For sales of real estate or assets classified as held for sale after January 1, 2015, we will evaluate whether a disposal transaction meets the criteria of a strategic shift and will have a major effect on our operations and financial results to determine whether the results of operations and gains on sale of real estate will be presented as part of our continuing operations or as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations.  If the disposal represents a strategic shift, it will be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented; if not, it will be presented in continuing operations.  Prior to the adoption, when we had no involvement after the sale of a real estate investment it was treated as a discontinued operation.

Condominium Inventory 
  For condominium inventory, at each reporting date, management compares the estimated fair value less costs to sell to the carrying value.  An adjustment is recorded to the extent that the fair value less selling costs is less than the carrying value.  We determine the estimated fair value of condominiums based on comparable sales in the normal course of business under existing and anticipated market conditions.  This evaluation takes into consideration estimated future selling prices, costs incurred to date, estimated additional future costs, and management s plans for the property.  On February 22, 2016, we sold our   one   remaining condominium unit in inventory at Chase   The Private Residences for a sales price of   $2.5 million  , receiving net proceeds of   $2.2 million   after closing costs. 
  Accounts Receivable 
  Accounts receivable primarily consist of straight-line rental revenue receivables of   $2 million   and   $4.2 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and receivables from our hotel operators and tenants related to our other consolidated properties of   $2.4 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The allowance for doubtful accounts was   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  Investment Impairment 
  For all of our real estate and real estate-related investments, we monitor events and changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts of the real estate assets may not be recoverable.  Examples of the types of events and circumstances that would cause management to assess our assets for potential impairment include, but are not limited to: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset; a significant change in the manner in which the asset is being used; an accumulation of costs in excess of the acquisition basis plus construction of the property; major vacancies and the resulting loss of revenues; natural disasters; a change in the projected holding period; legitimate purchase offers; and changes in the global and local markets or economic conditions.  Our assets may at times be concentrated in limited geographic locations and, to the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in limited geographic locations, downturns specifically related to such regions may result in tenants defaulting on their lease obligations at a portion of our properties within a short time period, which may result in asset impairments.  
  When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess potential impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated over the life of the asset and from its eventual disposition to the carrying amount of the asset.  These projected cash flows are prepared internally by the Advisor and reflect in-place and projected leasing activity, market revenue and expense growth rates, market capitalization rates, discount rates, and changes in economic and other relevant conditions.  The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer review these projected cash flows to assure that the valuation is prepared using reasonable inputs and assumptions that are consistent with market data and with assumptions that would be used by a third-party market participant and assume the highest and best use of the investment.  We consider trends, strategic decisions regarding future development plans, and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to adjust the carrying amount of the asset to estimated fair value.  While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding factors such as market rents, economic conditions, and occupancy rates could significantly affect these estimates. 
  In evaluating our investments for impairment, management may use appraisals and make estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the projected date of disposition of the properties, the estimated future cash flows of the properties during our ownership, planned development, and the projected sales price of each of the properties.  A future change in these estimates and assumptions could result in understating or overstating the book value of our investments, which could be material to our financial statements.  In addition, we may incur impairment charges on real estate assets classified as held for sale in the future if the carrying amount of the asset upon classification as held for sale exceeds the estimated fair value, less costs to sell. 
  We also evaluate our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture at each reporting date.  If we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value, we will record an impairment charge based on these evaluations.  We assess potential impairment by comparing our portion of estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by the joint venture over the life of the joint venture s assets to the carrying amount of the joint venture.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds our portion of estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to adjust the carrying amount of the joint venture to its estimated fair value.

The value of our properties held for development depends on market conditions, including estimates of the project start date, as well as estimates of future demand for the property type under development.  We have analyzed trends and other information related to each potential development and incorporated this information, as well as our current outlook, into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses.  Due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process with respect to impairments, including the fact that limited market information regarding the value of comparable land exists at this time, it is possible that actual results could differ substantially from those estimated. 
  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded   $9.2 million   of non-cash impairment charges as a result of measurable decreases in the fair value of two of our investments.  We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $2.2 million   for our Northpoint Central building based upon indication of a decline in market value of the asset.  In estimating the fair value of Northpoint Central, we primarily considered an appraisal prepared for the Plan of Liquidation.  The appraised value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.  We also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $7 million   for our unconsolidated investment in Central Europe.  We reviewed estimates of the underlying real estate assets of the venture based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and did not find the asset book value reported by the venture impaired.  We then evaluated our interest in the Central Europe investment for an other than temporary decline in market value and determined that we would not recover our investment during our hold period.  Due to the shortened hold period contemplated in the Plan of Liquidation, the lack of control by the Company to compel the venture to sell the remaining assets and liquidate the venture during our hold period, and the absence of a market to buy our interest, we recorded an impairment of our investment interest by discounting our interest in the investment by 40% to reflect the impact of holding a non-controlling interest.  
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded   $12.3 million   of non-cash impairment charges as a result of measurable decreases in the fair value of four of our investments.  We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $6.8 million   during 2015 for our Frisco Square land based on an indication of a change in market conditions for land development.  In estimating the fair value of the Frisco Square land, we considered market comparables as well as the time and costs to hold the land until developed.  We also recorded non-cash impairment charges of   $2.1 million   for Northborough Tower and   $2.7 million   for our Northpoint Central office building during 2015.  In estimating the fair value of both Northborough Tower and Northpoint Central, we considered offers received during the marketing process of the assets in the third quarter of 2015, market comparables, and management s internal discounted cash flow analysis prepared with the consideration of the market conditions in Houston where both buildings are located.  In addition, we recorded a   $0.7 million   impairment for our one remaining condominium unit at Chase   The Private Residences during 2015.  During the first quarter of 2016, we sold the condominium for a sales price of   $2.5 million  , receiving net proceeds of   $2.2 million   after closing costs. 
  We believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets, our properties under development, and our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is currently recoverable.  However, if market conditions worsen beyond our current expectations, or if our assumptions regarding expected future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of our assets decrease or our expected hold periods decrease, or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value calculations, we may need to take additional charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets.  Any such non-cash charges would have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
  Deferred Financing Fees 
  Deferred financing fees are recorded at cost and are amortized to interest expense using a straight-line method that approximates the effective interest method over the life of the related debt.  Deferred financing fees, net of accumulated amortization, were   $0.6 million   and   $1.2 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The   $1.2 million   balance of deferred financing fees, net of accumulated amortization, as of December 31, 2015, was composed of   $1.1 million   related to notes payable and less than   $0.1 million   related to obligations associated with real estate held for sale.  Accumulated amortization of deferred financing fees were   $1.7 million   and   $1.8 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  In April 2015, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2015-03 ) to ASC Topic 835, Interest - Imputation of Interest, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  The adoption of ASU 2015-03, effective January 1, 2016, required companies to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, retrospectively.

The adoption of the new standard resulted in the following reclassifications of unamortized deferred financing fees as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 

______________________________ 
  (1)  Obligations associated with real estate held for sale, as adjusted, consisted of   $14.8 million   of notes payable, net of deferred financing fees of less than   $0.1 million  , and other liabilities totaling an aggregate of less than   $0.1 million  . 
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  The functional currency for our international equity investment in Central Europe Joint Venture is the Euro.  We use period-end exchange rates to translate balances of assets and liabilities while the statement of operations amounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the respective period.  Gains and losses resulting from the change in exchange rates from period to period are reported separately as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ).  Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the foreign currency translation adjustment was a gain of   $0.2 million   and a gain of   $0.5 million  , respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the foreign currency translation adjustment was a loss of   $0.2 million   and a loss of   $1.9 million  , respectively. 
  When the Company ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a consolidated foreign entity and the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity, the cumulative translation adjustment ( CTA ) balance is required to be released into earnings.  For sales of an equity method investment that is a foreign entity, a pro rata portion of CTA attributable to the investment would be recognized in earnings when the investment is sold.  When an entity sells either a part or all of its investment in a consolidated foreign entity, CTA would be recognized in earnings only if the sale results in the parent no longer having a controlling financial interest in the foreign entity.  On July 28, 2008, we invested in the Central Europe Joint Venture that owned   22   properties.  Central Europe Joint Venture is our only foreign investment as of September 30, 2016.  The joint venture sold   one   property in 2014 and   three   properties in 2015, and had   18   properties remaining as of September 30, 2016.  We will recognize CTA upon the sale of all or substantially all of our investment in the Central Europe Joint Venture. 
  Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  These estimates include such items as impairment of long-lived assets, depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, and allowance for loan losses.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Subsequent Events 
  We have evaluated subsequent events for recognition or disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2014-09 ) to ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance.  The new guidance will require companies to apply a five-step model in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, as well as enhance disclosures regarding revenue recognition.  Lease contracts will be excluded from this revenue recognition criteria; however, the sale of real estate will be required to follow the new model.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  In addition, early adoption will be permitted beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods.  Either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption is permitted.  We do not expect that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on  
  
   12

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

our condensed consolidated financial statements; however, we will continue to evaluate this assessment until the guidance becomes effective. 
  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the FASB issued subsequent updates to ASU 2014-09.  In April 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-10 ) to ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  In May 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-12 ) to ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Narrow-Scope Improvement and Practical Expedients.  The amendments in these updates did not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606; rather, they added improvements to reduce the diversity in practice at initial application and the cost and complexity of applying Topic 606 both at transition and an ongoing basis.  The areas affected include: assessing the collectability criteria; presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers; noncash consideration; contract modification and completed contracts at transition; and technical correction as it relates to retrospective application and disclosure.  The new guidance is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2017, and allows full or modified retrospective application.  We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; however, we will continue to evaluate this assessment until the guidance becomes effective. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2014-15 ) to ASC Topic 205, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  ASU 2014-15 requires management s assessment of a company s ability to continue as a going concern and provide related footnote disclosures when conditions give rise to substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date.  ASU 2014-15 applies to all companies and is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter.  We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-02 ) to ASC Topic 842, Leases.  ASU 2016-02 supersedes the existing lease accounting model, and modifies both lessee and lessor accounting.  The new guidance will require lessees to recognize a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset, initially measured at the present value of lease payments, for both operating and financing leases.  For leases with a term of 12 months or less, lessees will be permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize lease liabilities and lease assets.  Under this new pronouncement, lessor accounting will be largely unchanged from existing GAAP.  The new standard will be effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  We do not expect that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements; however, we will continue to evaluate this assessment until the guidance becomes effective. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-15 ) to ASC Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The objective of this amendment is to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statements of cash flows.  Of the eight types of cash flows discussed in the new standard, the classification of debt prepayment, distributions received from equity method investees, and debt extinguishment costs as financing outflows may impact the Company.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The amendment in the update should be applied using the retrospective transition method for each period presented.  We will continue to evaluate the impact until the guidance becomes effective. 

4.    Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 
  Fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy) has been established. 
  Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that we have the ability to access.  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.  In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements  
  Historically, we have used interest rate caps to manage our interest rate risk.  The valuation of these instruments was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflected the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, implied volatilities, and foreign currency exchange rates. 
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no derivatives. 
  Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  
  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded   $9.2 million   of non-cash impairment charges as a result of measurable decreases in the fair value of two of our investments.  We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $2.2 million   for our Northpoint Central building based upon indication of a decline in market value of the asset.  In estimating the fair value of Northpoint Central, we primarily considered an appraisal prepared for the Plan of Liquidation.  The appraised value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.  We also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $7 million   for our unconsolidated investment in Central Europe.  We reviewed estimates of the underlying real estate assets of the venture based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and did not find the asset book value reported by the venture impaired.  We then evaluated our interest in the Central Europe investment for an other than temporary decline in market value and determined that we would not recover our investment value during our hold period.  Due to the shortened hold period contemplated in the Plan of Liquidation, the lack of control by the Company to compel the venture to sell the remaining assets and liquidate the venture during our hold period, and the absence of a market to buy our interest, we recorded an impairment of our investment interest by discounting our interest in the investment by 40% to reflect the impact of holding a non-controlling interest. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling   $12.3 million  .  We recorded   $2.1 million   and   $2.7 million   of non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of our Northborough Tower and Northpoint Central office buildings, respectively, to the estimated fair value.  In estimating the fair value of both Northborough Tower and Northpoint Central, we considered offers received during the marketing process of the assets in the third quarter of 2015, market comparables and management s internal discounted cash flow analysis prepared with the consideration of the market conditions in Houston where both buildings are located.  In addition, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $6.8 million   related to our Frisco Square land to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value based on an indication of a change in market conditions for land development.  In estimating the fair value of the Frisco Square land, we considered market comparables as well as the time and costs to hold the land until developed.  We also recorded a   $0.7 million   non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our one remaining condominium at Chase   The Private Residences to current market price.  We based the fair value on the current list price less concessions and closing costs totaling   $0.2 million   for a fair value of   $2.2 million   at December 31, 2015.  We sold the condominium for a cash consideration of   $2.5 million   on February 22, 2016.  The estimates are considered Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy described above.  
  The following fair value hierarchy tables present information about our assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands):  
   
 ________________________________ 
  (1)  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment of   $2.2 million   with our Northpoint Central office building.

5.    Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments 
  We determined the following disclosure of estimated fair values using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop the related estimates of fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.  The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management estimated that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities, and payables/receivables from related parties were at amounts that reasonably approximated their fair value based on their highly liquid nature and/or short-term maturities.  The fair values are based upon interest rates for mortgages with similar terms and remaining maturities that management believes we could obtain.  The fair value of the notes payable is categorized as a Level 2 basis.  The fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis valuation on the borrowing rates currently available for loans with similar terms and maturities.  The fair value of the notes payable was determined by discounting the future contractual interest and principal payments by a market rate.   
  Carrying amounts of our notes payable and the related estimated fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): 
   
  _________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Our debt secured by Las Colinas Commons, with a balance at December 31, 2015 of   $14.8 million  , net of deferred financing fees of   $0.1 million   is not included in the table, as the investment was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2015. 
     The fair value estimates presented herein are based on information available to our management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Although our management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these condensed consolidated financial statements since those respective dates, and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

6.    Real Estate Investments 
  As of September 30, 2016, we wholly owned   two   properties and consolidated   three   properties through investments in joint ventures on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  In addition, we have a noncontrolling, unconsolidated ownership interest in a joint venture consisting of   18   properties that are accounted for using the equity method.  Capital contributions, distributions, and profits and losses of these properties are allocated in accordance with the terms of the applicable partnership agreement.

    Our initial investment in Royal Island was made in May 2007.  We consolidated Royal Island as of June 6, 2012 when we obtained all of the outstanding shares of Royal Island (Australia) Pty Limited.  A third party indirectly owns   12.71%   of Royal Island. 
     Real Estate Development 
  The Ablon at Frisco Square 
  On August 26, 2014, we contributed   3.4   acres of land held by our Frisco Square mixed-use project to The Ablon at Frisco Square, LLC ( Ablon Frisco Square Venture ), a special purpose entity in which we own a   90%   limited partnership interest.  The venture was formed to construct a   275  -unit multifamily project.  Concurrently, with the land contribution, the joint venture closed on a   $26.3 million   construction loan.  See Note 9, Notes Payable, for additional information.  Construction on the development began on September 2, 2014.  Total construction costs for the development were approximately   $41.9 million  .  The project was completed and available for occupancy in the first quarter of 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the project was approximately   87%   leased and   82%   occupied. 
  Real Estate Asset Dispositions 
  Las Colinas Commons 
  On February 2, 2016, we sold Las Colinas Commons for a contract sales price of approximately   $14.3 million  , resulting in   $14 million   of cash proceeds after reduction for certain transaction costs.  We recorded a gain on sale of real estate property of   $1.3 million  .  Las Colinas Commons and Northpoint Central are both borrowers under a loan that matures in May 2017.  Under the terms of the loan, the lender required a release price payment of   $14.9 million   to release the Las Colinas Commons property from the loan.  A portion of the proceeds from the sale were used to pay off in full the existing indebtedness of approximately   $11.3 million   associated with the office building.  The   $3.6 million   excess principal payment amount was used to reduce Northpoint Central s allocated loan balance.  Las Colinas Commons was classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015.  The full release price was reclassified as a liability associated with our real estate held for sale as of December 31, 2015.

Northborough Tower 
  The non-recourse loan for Northborough Tower matured on January 11, 2016, and we did not repay the debt.  On May 9, 2016, we transferred the property to the lender via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.  As a result of the transfer, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $1.6 million   representing the difference between the debt extinguished of   $16 million   over the net book value of the assets and liabilities transferred to the lender of   $14.4 million  .  During 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment of   $2.1 million   for Northborough Tower.  At the date of transfer, we assessed the carrying value of the assets and liabilities transferred to the lender and concluded that an additional impairment was not needed. 
  Frisco Square Land Sale 
  On May 24, 2016, we sold a   5.2   acre parcel of undeveloped land at Frisco Square for a contract sales price of approximately   $8 million  .  We recorded a gain on sale of real estate property of   $1.7 million  . 
  Disposed Real Estate Reported in Continuing Operations 
  The Company does not view the 2016 disposals of Las Colinas Commons and Northborough Tower as a strategic shift.  Therefore, the results of operations of these properties continues to be included in continuing operations within the condensed consolidated statements of operations prior to the dispositions. 
  The following table presents net income (loss) attributable to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 related to Las Colinas Commons and Northborough Tower.  Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes the   $1.3 million   gain on sale of Las Colinas Commons and the   $1.6 million   gain on extinguishment of debt of Northborough Tower (in thousands): 

Discontinued Operations 
  Effective January 1, 2015, we adopted the provisions of FASB guidance in ASU 2014-08, issued in April 2014, regarding the reporting of discontinued operations.  As a result of this adoption, the results of operations and gain on sale of real estate from disposals from January 1, 2015 forward that do not meet the criteria of a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results will be presented as continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations.

     We will recognize CTA upon the sale of all or substantially all of the assets in our Central Europe Joint Venture, which is our only foreign investment.  See Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Foreign Currency Translation.  
  We evaluate our investment in unconsolidated joint venture at each reporting date.  If we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value, we will record an impairment charge based on these evaluations.  We assess potential impairment by comparing our portion of estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by the joint venture over the life of the joint venture s assets to the carrying amount of the joint venture.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds our portion of estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to adjust the carrying amount of the joint venture to its estimated fair value.  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a   $7 million   impairment in our unconsolidated investment in Central Europe.  See Note 4, Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value for more information.

7.    Real Estate Held for Sale 
  As of December 31, 2015, Las Colinas Commons was classified as real estate held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet.  We did not have any real estate assets classified as held for sale at September 30, 2016. 
  In 2006, we acquired Las Colinas Commons, an office building located in the Dallas, Texas area.  We entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party on December 18, 2015 with a contract sales price of   $14.3 million  .  The sales transaction closed on February 2, 2016.  
  The major classes of assets and liabilities associated with our real estate held for sale as of December 31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands): 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Las Colinas Commons and Northpoint Central are both borrowers under a loan that matures in May 2017.  The Las Colinas Commons loan balance at December 31, 2015 was   $11.3 million  .  Under the terms of the loan, the lender required a release price payment of   $14.9 million   to release the Las Colinas Commons property from the loan.  The   $3.6 million   excess principal payment was used to reduce Northpoint Central s allocated loan balance.  We reclassified the full release price as a liability associated with our real estate held for sale as of December 31, 2015. 
              (2) 
    Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03, which requires companies to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.  See Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under the caption   Deferred Financing Fees   for further details.  

8.    Variable Interest Entities 
  As discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, effective January 1, 2016, we have adopted the guidance in ASU 2015-02.  As a result, the Operating Partnership (see Note 1, Business) and each of our less than wholly-owned real estate partnerships (Behringer Harvard Cordillera, LLC, Behringer Harvard Residences at Cordillera, LLC and Behringer Harvard Royal Island Debt, LP) have been deemed to have the characteristics of a VIE.  However, we were not required to consolidate any previously unconsolidated entities or deconsolidate any previously consolidated entities as a result of the change in classification.  Accordingly, there has been no change to the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows or amounts recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Consolidated VIEs 
  We consolidate the Operating Partnership, Behringer Harvard Cordillera, LLC, Behringer Harvard Residences at Cordillera, LLC, and Behringer Harvard Royal Island Debt, LP, which are variable interest entities, or VIEs, for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.  Generally, a VIE is a legal entity in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or the equity investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.  A limited partnership is considered a VIE when the majority of the limited partners unrelated to the general partner possess neither the right to remove the general partner without cause, nor certain rights to participate in the decisions that most significantly affect the financial results of the partnership.  In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the

amount and characteristics of our investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other investors to provide financial support; and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the business activities of the other investors.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of real estate held by these VIEs and general market conditions. 

9.         Notes Payable 
  The following table sets forth our notes payable on our consolidated properties at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 

_________________________________ 
           (1)  
    Due to the maturity default on our Northborough Tower debt, the stated interest rate of   5.67%   was increased to the default interest rate of   8.67%   effective January 12, 2016.  The property was transferred to the lender via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on May 9, 2016. 
              (2) 
    In January 2016, the lenders agreed to increase the amount available to draw on the loan to   $14.4 million  .  In April 2016, the lenders agreed to increase the amount available to draw on the loan to   $14.5 million  .  We received a short term extension of the loan secured by Royal Island, extending our maturity date from November 10, 2016 to November 30, 2016. 
              (3) 
    Las Colinas Commons and Northpoint Central are both borrowers under a loan that matures in May 2017.  The Las Colinas Commons loan balance at December 31, 2015 was   $11.3 million  .  Under the terms of the loan, the lender required a release price payment of   $14.9 million   to release the Las Colinas Commons property from the loan.  The   $3.6 million   excess principal payment amount was used to reduce Northpoint Central s allocated loan balance.  We reclassified the full release price as a liability associated with our real estate held for sale as of December 31, 2015.  
               (5) 
    Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03, which requires companies to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.  See Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under the caption   Deferred Financing Fees   for further details.  
     Our notes payable balance, net of deferred financing fees of   $0.6 million  , was   $142.5 million   at September 30, 2016.  Our notes payable balance at December 31, 2015, was   $154.5 million  , net of deferred financing fees of   $1.1 million  , and excluding   $14.8 million   of contractual obligations on real estate held for sale, net of deferred financing fees of less than   $0.1 million   at December 31, 2015, consisted of new financing and loan assumptions related to our consolidated property acquisitions.

Each of our notes payable is collateralized by one or more of our properties.  At September 30, 2016, our notes payable interest rates ranged from   3%   to   15%  , with a weighted average interest rate of approximately   5.3%  .  Of our   $142.5 million   in notes payable at September 30, 2016,   $56.5 million   represented debt subject to variable interest rates.  At September 30, 2016, our notes payable had maturity dates that ranged from October 2016 to February 2018.  We have unconditionally guaranteed payment of the notes payable related to the four loan tranches associated with our Frisco Square investment (the  BHFS Loans ) up to   $11.2 million  .  The BHFS Loans had an outstanding balance at September 30, 2016 of   $30.2 million  . 
  Las Colinas Commons and Northpoint Central are both borrowers under a loan that matures in May 2017.  The Las Colinas Commons allocated loan balance at December 31, 2015 was   $11.3 million  .  Under the terms of the loan, the lender required a release price payment of   $14.9 million   to release the Las Colinas Commons property from the loan.  The   $3.6 million   excess principal payment amount was used to reduce Northpoint Central s loan balance.  The full release price was reclassified as a liability associated with our real estate held for sale as of December 31, 2015.  We sold the Las Colinas Commons office buildings on February 2, 2016 and paid in full the existing indebtedness of the Las Colinas Commons loan of   $11.3 million   and paid   $3.6 million   to reduce Northpoint Central s allocated loan balance.  As of September 30, 2016, the loan balance associated with Northpoint Central was   $10.9 million  .       
  The notes related to Royal Island, Northpoint Central, Chase Park Plaza Hotel, and Ablon at Frisco Square mature in the next   12   months.  The loans are non-recourse to the Company.  We are in various stages of marketing our assets for sale and generally expect to sell assets prior to their loan maturities.  We are in negotiations to sell Royal Island to the lender for   $0.9 million   and discharge of all indebtedness.  We are currently marketing Northpoint Central for sale and expect to complete a sale prior to the loan maturity in May 2017.  The loan is non-recourse to the Company.  If we do not receive offers above the debt or are unable to close a sale transaction prior to maturity, we will consider all alternatives, including transferring legal possession of the property to the lender.  The Chase Park Plaza loan matures in August 2017.  We are in early stages of marketing the hotel for sale in 2017, but have also engaged a broker to explore refinancing options for the asset in the event we do not have a sale transaction prior to maturity.  The Ablon at Frisco Square loan matures in August 2017 and has   two     one  -year extensions available.  If we do not sell the asset prior to its mortgage maturity, we expect to exercise the extension option. 
  Ablon at Frisco Square Financing  
  On August 26, 2014, the Ablon Frisco Square Venture obtained a   $26.3 million   construction loan.  The loan incurs interest at   30  -day LIBOR plus   2.5%   and has a   three  -year term with   two     12  -month extensions available.  Payments of interest-only are required during the initial   three  -year term.  As of September 30, 2016, we had drawn   $26.3 million   under the construction loan.  The project was completed and available for occupancy in the first quarter of 2016.  Our joint venture partner, or one of its affiliates, has provided the completion guaranty and any other carve-out guaranties for the construction loan. 
  Northborough Tower Debt 
  The non-recourse loan for our Northborough Tower office building matured on January 11, 2016, and we did not pay the outstanding principal balance, which constituted an event of default.  Prior to the debt maturity we had actively marketed the property for sale, but did not receive any offers above the loan balance.  In December 2015, the lender exercised its right to control the operating funds of the property, as the single tenant of building moved out during the third quarter of 2015.  The tenant s lease does not expire until April 2018, and the tenant continued to make its monthly rental payment.  On February 5, 2016, we received a notice from the lender of their intent to increase the interest on the Northborough loan to the default interest rate of   8.67%  , effective January 12, 2016, due to the maturity default.  In February 2016, the lender applied   $0.9 million   of cash reserves held for tenant and capital improvements to the principal balance of the loan.  The lender also applied   $0.8 million   of excess cash reserves to the principal balance of the loan.  On March 15, 2016, we received a notice that Northborough Tower had been posted for foreclosure on April 5, 2016.  The property was transferred to the lender via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on May 9, 2016.  The outstanding principal balance at the time of the transfer to the lender was   $15.9 million  .  
  Chase Park Plaza Modification 
  On August 4, 2016, we modified the Chase Park Plaza loan to extend the completion date for the required room and common area renovations from August 10, 2016 to August 10, 2017.  The Company previously provided a completion guarantee of   $6.5 million   for the required renovations and that guarantee was reaffirmed with the modification.  If the renovation is not completed by August 10, 2017 the lender may require the Company to escrow   125%   of the unspent funds related to the renovation.  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  
  Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT I, Inc. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

The loan continues to bear interest at   4.95%   and matures on August 11, 2017 with   two     one  -year extensions available.  Under the modification, the property must have a debt service coverage ratio, as defined, of   1.35   to exercise the extension options.  Under the modified loan, we are required to escrow   $1.5 million   with the lender for the estimated 2017 property tax increase due to the expirations of the   10  -year property tax abatement program in December 2016.   
  The modification also requires the establishment of a   $3.1 million   escrow related to certain facade repairs and enhancements.  The lender will disburse funds from the escrow monthly to pay the construction contract draws as the construction project is invoiced and completed.  The Park Plaza Residential Association is responsible to reimburse   39.3%   of the construction cost as invoiced.  The project is expected to be completed in December 2017.  The escrow balance was   $2.9 million   at September 30, 2016. 
  The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations for principal payments as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands): 

10.    Commitments and Contingencies  
  Frisco Square 
  In connection with our investment in the Frisco Square property, we were initially responsible, through our wholly owned subsidiaries who hold title to the Frisco Square property, for half of the bond debt service related to the   $12.5 million   of bonds (the  Bond Obligation ) the City of Frisco issued to fund public improvements within the Frisco Square Management District (the  MMD ).  For each   $1 million   increase in assessed value for the real property within the MMD above   $125 million  , the Bond Obligation is reduced by   1.0%   and will terminate at   $225 million   of real property values.  The total outstanding Bond Obligation at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was   $4.2 million   and   $4.7 million  , respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, the value of the real property within the MMD is assessed at   $174 million  .  Therefore, we are currently responsible for   27%   of the bond debt service payments. 
  Although, as described above, we are ultimately responsible for   27%   of the bond debt service payments, the Frisco Square Property Owner s Association (the  POA ) has the authority to assess its members for various monetary obligations related to the Frisco Square development, including the Bond Obligation, based upon the value of the real property and real property improvements.  We are not the sole member of the POA.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, the annual bond debt service assessed by the POA is approximately   $0.3 million  .  We estimate our annual pro rata share of the expense at less than   $0.1 million  .  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we expensed less than   $0.1 million   related to bond debt service, which is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss. 
  Under an amended development agreement with the City of Frisco, we were obligated to construct certain parking improvements (the  Parking Obligation ).  The City of Frisco secured the Bond Obligation and the Parking Obligation by placing liens on the vacant land held by our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, BHFS I, LLC.  In the event we sold all or a part of the vacant land,   33%   of the net sales proceeds were to be deposited into an escrow account ( City Escrow ) for the benefit of the City of Frisco to secure the Parking Obligation until the amount in the City Escrow account was   $7 million  .  As of December 31, 2015 we had   $1.4 million   in the City Escrow from land sales.  We completed the requirements of the Parking Obligation in February 2016 and the City of Frisco released the City Escrow of   $1.4 million   and the liens on the land on March 15, 2016 and March 17, 2016, respectively.

Chase Park Plaza Hotel 
  Under the Chase Park Plaza Hotel loan agreement, the Company provided a completion guarantee of   $6.5 million   for room renovations and other improvements to be finished by August 10, 2017.  If the renovation is not completed by August 10, 2017 the lender may require the Company to escrow   125%   of the unspent funds related to the renovation.  In August 2016, as part of our Chase Park Plaza loan modification, we escrowed   $3.1 million   for a construction project and   $1.5 million   for 2017 real estate taxes.  At September 30, 2016, the construction and tax escrow balances are   $2.9 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively. 
  Royal Island 
  We are currently in negotiations to sell our Royal Island asset to its lender for   $0.9 million   and discharge of all indebtedness under the loan.  The proceeds from the sale are not sufficient to pay the outstanding obligations of the partnership entities that own Royal Island.  These obligations are non-recourse to the Company.  The Company is exploring alternatives to settle these obligations, which may include, placing the underlying partnerships in receivership or some other form of judicial liquidation process. 

11.    Related Party Transactions 
  The Advisor and certain of its affiliates receive fees and compensation in connection with the acquisition, financing, management, and sale of our assets. 
  Since our inception, the Advisor or its predecessors have been responsible for managing our day-to-day affairs and for, among other things, identifying and making acquisitions and other investments on our behalf.  Our relationship with the Advisor, including the fees paid by us to the Advisor or the reimbursement of expenses by us for amounts paid, or incurred by the Advisor, on our behalf is governed by an advisory management agreement that has been in place since September 20, 2005 and amended at various times thereafter.  On May 31, 2016 we entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Advisory Management Agreement (the  Fourth Advisory Agreement ) effective as of May 15, 2016. 
  The Fourth Advisory Agreement amended and restated the Third Amended and Restated Advisory Management Agreement (the  Third Advisory Agreement ), as amended by the First Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Advisory Management Agreement (the  First Amendment to Third Advisory Agreement ) to: (a) incorporate amendments made by the First Amendment to Third Advisory Agreement into the body of the agreement; (b) amend certain limitations on expense reimbursements to the Advisor; (c) amend the non-solicitation provision; and (d) extend the term of the agreement to May 15, 2017.  In all other material respects, the terms of the agreement remain unchanged. 
  We pay the Advisor or its affiliates an asset management fee of   0.575%   of the aggregate asset value of acquired real estate and real estate-related assets other than Royal Island.  The fee is payable monthly in arrears in an amount equal to one-twelfth of   0.575%   of the aggregate asset value as of the last day of the month.  For each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately   $0.5 million   and   $0.6 million   of asset management fees, respectively.  For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately   $1.5 million   and   $1.7 million   of asset management fees, respectively. 
  The Advisor, or its affiliates, receive acquisition and advisory fees of   2.5%   of the contract purchase price of each asset for the acquisition, development, or construction of real property or   2.5%   of the funds advanced in respect of a loan investment.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred   no   acquisition and advisory fees.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred acquisition and advisory fees of   $0.2 million   related to The Ablon at Frisco Square development. 
  The debt financing fee paid to the Advisor for a Loan (as defined in the agreement) will be   1%   of the loan commitment amount.  Amounts due to the Advisor for a Revised Loan (as defined in the agreement) will be   40 basis points   of the loan commitment amount for the first year of any extension (provided the extension is for at least   120 days  ), an additional   30 basis points   for the second year of an extension, and another   30 basis points   for the third year of an extension in each case, prorated for any extension period less than a full year.  The maximum debt financing fee for any extension of three or more years is   1%   of the loan commitment amount.  We did not incur any debt financing fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

Subject to certain restrictions as described in the Fourth Advisory Agreement, we reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates for all expenses paid or incurred by them in connection with the services they provide to us, including direct expenses and the costs of salaries and benefits of persons employed by those entities and performing services for us, subject to the limitation that we will not reimburse for any amount by which our Advisor s operating expenses (including the asset management fee) at the end of the   four   fiscal quarters immediately preceding the date reimbursement is sought exceeds the greater of (i)   2%   of our average invested assets or (ii)   25%   of our net income for that four quarter period other than any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves and any gain from the sale of our assets for that period.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, we may reimburse the Advisor for expenses in excess of this limitation if a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.  In addition, pursuant to the Fourth Advisory Agreement, our obligation to reimburse the Advisor for certain costs incurred in connection with administrative services (i) during 2016 is limited to   $1.66 million   and (ii) during 2017 is limited to   $1.66 million   prorated for the number of days during 2017 for which the Advisor provides services to us pursuant to the Fourth Advisory Agreement.  Pursuant to First Amendment to Third Advisory Agreement, our obligation to reimburse the Advisor for certain costs incurred in connection with administrative services during 2015 was limited to   $1.7 million  .  We do not reimburse our Advisor for the salaries and benefits that our Advisor or its affiliates pay to our named executive officers.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred costs for administrative services of   $0.3 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred costs for administrative services of   $0.9 million   and   $1 million  , respectively. 
  Additionally, on May 31, 2016, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Property Management and Leasing Agreement ( Third Property Management Agreement ) with the Operating Partnership.  Behringer Harvard Opportunity Management Services, LLC, an affiliated Texas limited liability company (the  Manager ), Behringer Harvard Real Estate Services, LLC, an affiliated Texas limited liability company, and several affiliated special purpose entities formed to directly own the properties in which the Company has invested (collectively,  BH Property Management ). 
  The Third Property Management Agreement amended and restated the Second Amended and Restated Property Management and Leasing Agreement ( Second Property Management Agreement ), as amended by the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Property Management and Leasing Agreement (the  First Amendment to Second Property Management Agreement ) to amend the non-solicitation provision and incorporate the amendments made by the First Amendment to Second Property Management Agreement into the body of the agreement.  In all other material respects, the terms of the agreement remain unchanged. 
  We pay our property manager and affiliate of the Advisor, Behringer Harvard Opportunity Management Services, LLC or its affiliates (collectively,  BH Property Management ), fees for management, leasing, and maintenance supervision of our properties.  Such fees are equal to   4.5%   of gross revenues plus leasing commissions based upon the customary leasing commission applicable to the same geographic location of the respective property.  We will pay BH Property Management an oversight fee equal to   0.5%   of gross revenues of the property managed if we contract directly with a non-affiliated third-party property manager in respect of the property.  In no event will we pay both a property management fee and an oversight fee to BH Property Management with respect to any particular property.  If we own a property through a joint venture that does not pay BH Property Management directly for its services, we will pay BH Property Management a management fee or oversight fee, as applicable, based only on our economic interest in the property.  We incurred property management fees or oversight fees of approximately   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We incurred property management fees or oversight fees of approximately   $0.5 million   and   $0.7 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a payable to our Advisor and its affiliates of   $0.4 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively.  These balances consist of accrued fees, including asset management fees, administrative service expenses, property management fees, and other miscellaneous costs payable to the Advisor and BH Property Management.  
  We are dependent on the Advisors and BH Property Management for certain services that are essential to us, including asset disposition decisions, property management and leasing services, and other general administrative responsibilities.  If these companies are unable to provide us with the respective services, we would be required to obtain such services from other sources.

Item 2.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto: 
   
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  These forward-looking statements include discussion and analysis of the financial condition of Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT I, Inc. and our subsidiaries (which may be referred to herein as the  Company,   REIT,   we,   us,  or  our ), including our ability to rent space on favorable terms, to address our debt maturities and to fund our liquidity requirements, the value of our assets, our anticipated capital expenditures, the amount and timing of anticipated cash distributions to our stockholders, the estimated per share value of our common stock, and other matters.  Words such as  may,   anticipates,   expects,   intends,   plans,   believes,   seeks,   estimates,   would,   could,   should  and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
  These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but reflect the intent, belief, or current expectations of our management based on their knowledge and understanding of the business and industry, the economy, and other future conditions.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we caution stockholders not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

  Executive Overview 
  We are a Maryland corporation that was formed in November 2004 to invest in and operate commercial real estate or real estate-related assets located in or outside the United States on an opportunistic and value-add basis.  We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating partnership and its subsidiaries.  We are organized and qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
  We are externally managed and advised by the Advisor, a Texas limited liability company formed in June 2007.  The Advisor is responsible for managing our day-to-day affairs and for identifying and making dispositions on our behalf. 
  As of September 30, 2016, we wholly owned two properties and consolidated three properties through investments in joint ventures, all of which were consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements.  In addition, we have a noncontrolling, unconsolidated ownership interest in a joint venture consisting of 18 properties that is accounted for using the equity method.  Our investment properties are located in Colorado, Missouri, Texas, the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the Czech Republic, and Poland.  
  On August 26, 2016, in connection with a review of potential strategic alternatives available to us, our board of directors unanimously approved a plan for the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation.  The Company is in various stages of marketing all of its assets for sale and if the Plan of Liquidation is approved, it expects to market and dispose of its remaining assets within two years.  Pursuant to our charter, the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the Plan of Liquidation is required for approval of the Plan of Liquidation.  We can provide no assurance that the Plan of Liquidation will be approved by our stockholders. 
  If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by our stockholders, we expect to make liquidating distribution payments to our stockholders after we sell all of our assets, pay all of our known liabilities, and provide for unknown liabilities.  We expect to complete these activities within 24 months after stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation; however, there can be no assurances regarding the amounts or timing of any liquidating distributions. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity     Demands 
  Our financial statements are presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business as we proceed through our disposition phase.  As is usual for opportunity-style real estate investment programs, we are structured as a finite-life entity.  As discussed above, our board of directors unanimously approved a plan for the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation.  If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by our stockholders, we expect to sell all of our assets, pay all of our known liabilities, provide for unknown liabilities, and distribute the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders.  There can be no assurances regarding the amounts or timing of any liquidating distributions.  It is possible that we will invest additional capital in some of our assets in order to position these assets for sale in the normal course of business.  We have experienced significant losses and may generate negative cash flows as mortgage note obligations and expenses exceed revenues.  If we are unable to sell a property when we determine to do so as contemplated in our business plan, it could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows necessary to meet our mortgage obligations and to satisfy our other liabilities in the normal course of business. 
  Our ability to continue as a going concern and execute our Plan of Liquidation is dependent upon our ability to sell real estate investments, to pay or retire debt as it matures if extensions or new financings are unavailable, and to fund certain ongoing costs of our Company, including our development and operating properties.  Our principal demands for funds for the next twelve months and beyond will be for the payment of costs associated with the lease-up of available space at our operating properties (including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, and capital improvements), certain ongoing costs at our development properties, Company operating expenses, and interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness.  We expect to fund a portion of these demands by using cash flow from operations of our current investments and borrowings.

We continually evaluate our liquidity and ability to fund future operations and debt obligations.  Our cash balance at September 30, 2016 is $22 million.  The notes related to Royal Island, Northpoint Central, Chase Park Plaza Hotel, and Ablon at Frisco Square mature in the next 12 months.  The loans are non-recourse to the Company.  We are in various stages of marketing our assets for sale and generally expect to sell assets prior to their loan maturities.  See below, under the caption   Debt Financings  , for further details.  
    We may be required to establish capital reserves from cash flow generated by operating properties or net sales proceeds from the sale of our properties.  Capital reserves are typically utilized for non-operating expenses such as tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and major capital expenditures.  In August 2016, as part of our Chase Park Plaza loan modification, we escrowed $3.1 million for a construction project and $1.5 million for 2017 real estate taxes.  See below, under the caption   Loan Modifications,   for further details.  
  In addition to our debt obligations, we consider lease expirations at our consolidated office properties and other factors in evaluating our liquidity.  Operating leases for our office buildings representing 1.3% of annualized base rent and rentable square footage (effective annual rent per square foot of $29.00) will expire by the end of 2016.  In the normal course of business, we are pursuing renewals, extensions, and new leases.  If we are unable to renew or extend the expiring leases under similar terms or are unable to negotiate new leases, it would negatively impact our liquidity and consequently adversely affect our ability to fund our ongoing operations.  Further, it would adversely affect the value of the investment and reduce the proceeds we would receive upon the sale of the asset.   
  In addition, our portfolio is concentrated in certain geographic regions and industries, and downturns relating generally to those regions or industries may result in defaults by a number of tenants within a short time period.  Any defaults would negatively affect our liquidity and adversely affect our ability to fund our ongoing operations.  Further, it would adversely affect the value of the investment and reduce the proceeds we would receive upon the sale of the asset.  In particular, the Northpoint Central office building is located in the Greenspoint submarket in Houston, Texas.  Demand for commercial properties in this submarket is weak due to several large blocks of space that became available as large scale users have vacated the submarket and the current volatility within the energy sector.  With the uncertainty created from these relocations, the current volatility within the energy sector, and the limited number of office building transactions, it is difficult to underwrite commercial assets in this submarket.  During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge for Northpoint Central.  See Note 4, Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value, for information on impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of 2016.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, excluding our disposed properties, Las Colinas Commons and Northborough Tower, 16% of our total revenues, without consideration of tenant contraction or termination rights, were derived from our office buildings, both of which are located in Texas.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 16% and 66% of our total revenues, without consideration of tenant contraction or termination rights, were derived from our Frisco Square mixed-use development and Chase Park Plaza Hotel, respectively.  
  As discussed above, our board of directors unanimously approved a plan for the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation.  If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by our stockholders, we expect to sell all of our assets, pay all of our known liabilities, provide for unknown liabilities, and distribute the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders.   There can be no assurances regarding the amounts or timing of any liquidating distributions.   
  Asset Sales 
  The economic environment and limited availability of credit to buyers for opportunistic asset classes such as ours could delay or inhibit our ability to dispose of our properties in an orderly manner or cause us to have to dispose of our properties for lower than anticipated sales prices.  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union ( Brexit ).  Brexit is a major source of uncertainty that could cause a slowdown in economic activity across the European Union countries.  This uncertainty could delay the disposition of our Central European properties or cause us to ultimately sell our assets for less than our current expected valuation.  There can be no assurance that future dispositions will occur as planned or, if they occur, that they will help us to meet our liquidity demands. 
  On December 22, 2015, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the Behringer Harvard Royal Island Debt, LP lender for the sale of Royal Island.  The contract sales price was $0.9 million in cash and discharge of all indebtedness under the loan.  The loan balance and accrued interest at September 30, 2016 is $23.7 million.  The sale is subject to approval by the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.  The contract expired on April 30, 2016 as a result of the failure of the purchaser to obtain necessary governmental approvals.  We are in discussions with the purchaser to extend or reenter a purchase and sale agreement upon substantially the same terms.  On May 5, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement for The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera for a contract price of $10 million.  The sale is subject to zoning amendments.  The purchaser received approval in early October, however, interested parties have 30 days to appeal the decision.  Assuming the zoning amendments are not appealed, we expect to close the transaction in late December 2016.

On June 27, 2016, we executed a purchase and sale agreement ( PSA ) to sell a 3.83 acre parcel of undeveloped land at Frisco Square to a third party for $5 million.  We expect the sale to close in December 2016; however, the purchaser may terminate the contract without penalty if it is unable to get approvals from the City of Frisco for its proposed site plan or if it is unable to obtain financing for the project.  On August 12, 2016, we executed a PSA to sell 3.39 acres of land to a third party for approximately $4.3 million.  The purchaser is currently in its due diligence phase and may terminate the contract without penalty.  If the purchaser does not terminate, we expect the sale to close in early 2017.  In addition, all of the purchase and sale agreements have provisions that allow for contract price adjustments upon certain conditions.  There are no assurances that we will complete these transactions. 
  On February 2, 2016, we sold our Las Colinas Commons office buildings for a contract sales price of $14.3 million.  On February 22, 2016, we sold our remaining condominium unit in inventory at Chase   The Private Residences for a sales price of $2.5 million, receiving net proceeds of $2.2 million after closing costs.  On May 24, 2016, we sold a 5.2 acre parcel of undeveloped land at Frisco Square for a contract sales price of $8 million. 
  Debt Financings 
  One of our principal short-term and long-term liquidity requirements is the repayment of maturing debt.  The following table provides information with respect to the contractual maturities and scheduled principal repayments of our indebtedness as of September 30, 2016.  Interest payments on variable rate debt are based on rates in effect as of September 30, 2016.  The table does not represent any extension options (in thousands): 

________________________________ 
           (1)   
    Does not include $0.6 million of unamortized deferred financing fees as of September 30, 2016.  Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03, which requires companies to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.  See Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under the caption   Deferred Financing Fees   for further details.  
       
  Our non-recourse debt secured by Northborough Tower matured on January 11, 2016.  The property was transferred to the lender via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on May 9, 2016.  The principal balance of the debt at the transfer was $15.9 million. 
  The notes related to Royal Island, Northpoint Central, Chase Park Plaza Hotel, and Ablon at Frisco Square mature in the next 12 months.  The loans are non-recourse to the Company.  We are in various stages of marketing our assets for sale and generally expect to sell assets prior to their loan maturities.  We are in negotiations to sell Royal Island to the lender for $0.9 million and discharge of all indebtedness.  We received a short term extension of the loan secured by Royal Island, extending our maturity date from November 10, 2016 to November 30, 2016.  We are currently marketing Northpoint Central for sale and expect to complete a sale prior to the loan maturity in May 2017.  If we do not receive offers above the debt or are unable to close a sale transaction prior to maturity, we will consider all alternatives, including transferring legal possession of the property to the lender.  The Chase Park Plaza loan matures in August 2017.  We are in early stages of exploring a sale of the hotel in 2017, but have also engaged a broker to explore refinancing options for the asset if we do not have a sale transaction prior to maturity.  The Ablon at Frisco Square loan matures in August 2017 and has two one-year extensions available.  If we do not sell the asset prior to its mortgage maturity, we expect to exercise the extension option. 
  Our loan agreements stipulate that we comply with certain reporting and financial covenants.  These covenants include, among other things, maintaining minimum debt service coverage ratios, loan to value ratios, and liquidity.  As of September 30, 2016, we believe we were in compliance with the debt covenants under our loan agreements. 
  We currently expect to use funds generated by our operating properties, additional borrowings, and proceeds from the disposition of properties to continue making our scheduled debt service payments until the maturity dates of the loans are extended or the loans are refinanced or completely paid off.  However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to refinance our borrowings with more or less favorable terms or extend the maturity dates of such loans.  To the extent we are unable to reach agreeable terms with respect to extensions or refinancings, we may not have the cash necessary to repay our debt as it  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

matures, which could result in an event of default that could allow lenders to foreclose on the property in satisfaction of the debt, seek repayment of the full amount of the debt outstanding from us, or pursue other remedies. 
  Each of our loans is secured by one or more of our properties.  At September 30, 2016, interest rates on our notes payable ranged from 3% to 15%, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.3%.  Generally, our notes payable mature at approximately two to nine years from origination and require payments of interest-only for approximately two to five years, with all principal and interest due at maturity.  Notes payable associated with our Frisco Square and Northpoint Central investments require monthly payments of principal and interest.  At September 30, 2016, our notes payable had maturity dates that ranged from October 2016 to February 2018. 
  Our ability to fund our liquidity requirements is expected to come from cash and cash equivalents (which total $22 million on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016), operating cash flow from properties, new borrowings, and proceeds from the disposition of our properties.  As necessary, we may seek alternative sources of financing, including using the proceeds from the sale of our properties, to achieve our investment objectives. 
  As of September 30, 2016, restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet of $9.1 million included amounts set aside related to certain operating properties for tenant improvements and commission reserves, tax reserves, maintenance and capital expenditures reserves, and other amounts as may be required by our lenders. 
  As the overall cost of borrowing increases, either by increases in the index rates or by increases in lender spreads, we will need to factor such increases into the economics of our property developments.  This may result in our investment operations generating lower overall economic returns and a reduced level of cash flow. 
  Loan Modifications 
  In February 2011, Behringer Harvard Royal Island Debt, LP secured a $10.4 million loan (the  Debt LP Loan ) for the purpose of preserving and protecting the collateral securing the Royal Island bridge loan.  In February 2013 and June 2013, the lender agreed to increase the amount available to draw on the Debt LP Loan to $11.6 million and $12.4 million, respectively.  Beginning in October 2013 through June 2014, the lender increased the availability of the Debt LP Loan each month by the amount of the monthly operating costs.  The lender ceased funding the monthly operating costs in July 2014.  On January 25, 2016, the lenders agreed to increase the amount of the loan by $0.6 million to $14.4 million to fund the estimated operating costs through the sale of the property.  On April 30, 2016, the lenders agreed to increase the amount of the Debt LP Loan by an additional $0.1 million to $14.5 million to fund additional operating costs of the property as the purchaser awaits approval from the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to acquire the property.  We received a short term extension of the loan secured by Royal Island, extending our maturity date from November 10, 2016 to November 30, 2016. 
  On August 4, 2016, we modified the Chase Park Plaza loan to extend the completion date for the required room and common area renovations from August 10, 2016 to August 10, 2017.  The Company previously provided a completion guarantee of $6.5 million for the required renovations and that guarantee was reaffirmed with the modification.  The loan continues to bear interest at 4.95% and matures on August 11, 2017 with two one-year extensions available.  Under the modification the property must have a debt service coverage ratio, as defined, of 1.35 to exercise the extension options.  Under the modified loan, we are required to escrow $1.5 million with the lender for the estimated 2017 property tax increase due to the expiration of the 10-year property tax abatement program in December 2016.   
  The Chase Park Plaza loan modification also requires the establishment of a $3.1 million escrow related to certain facade repairs and enhancements.  The lender will disburse funds from the escrow monthly to pay the construction contract draws as the construction repair project is invoiced and completed.  The Park Plaza Residential Association is responsible to reimburse 39.3% of the construction cost as invoiced.  The project is expected to be completed in December 2017.  At September 30, 2016, the construction escrow balance was $2.9 million.

Results of Operations 
  As of September 30, 2016, we were invested in six assets, five of which were consolidated (two of those were wholly owned and three properties were consolidated through investments in joint ventures).  In addition, we had an unconsolidated ownership interest in a joint venture consisting of 18 properties at September 30, 2016 that was accounted for using the equity method.  Our investment properties are located in Colorado, Missouri, Texas, the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the Czech Republic, and Poland.

We also had an unconsolidated ownership interest in a joint venture consisting of 19 properties at September 30, 2015 that was accounted for using the equity method.  Our investment properties were located in Colorado, Missouri, Nevada, Texas, the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia. 
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to three months ended September 30, 2015 
  The following table provides summary information about our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in thousands):

Revenues.    Our total revenues decreased by $0.8 million to $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the 2016 asset dispositions of Las Colinas Commons and Northborough Tower. 
  The change in revenues also included the following: 
             
    Rental revenue decreased $1.5 million to $3.6 million for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $5.1 million for the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to a decrease of $0.7 million in rental revenue for our Las Colinas Commons office building, which was sold on February 2, 2016, and a decrease of $1.5 million in rental revenue for our Northborough Tower office building, which was disposed on May 9, 2016.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.9 million related to The Ablon at Frisco Square, which began operations in February 2016. 
                
    Hotel revenue increased $0.7 million to $10.4 million during the third quarter of 2016 primarily due to a 2.9% increase in occupancy at Chase Park Plaza Hotel and an 11.8% increase in occupancy at The Lodge   Spa at Cordillera. 
     Property operating expenses.    Property operating expenses were approximately $1.5 million and $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were composed of operating expenses from our consolidated properties.  The $0.4 million decrease was primarily due to the 2016 asset dispositions of Las Colinas Commons and Northborough Tower. 
  Hotel operating expenses.    Hotel operating expenses were approximately $7.6 million and $7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for an increase of approximately $0.2 million.  Hotel operating expenses at Chase Park Plaza Hotel increased approximately $0.2 million primarily due to an increase in food and beverage service expense.  Hotel operating expenses at The Lodge   Spa at Cordillera remained fairly constant period-over-period. 
  Bad debt expense (recovery).    We had bad debt expenses of less than $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to bad debt recoveries of less than $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2015.   
  Interest expense.    Interest expense remained fairly constant at $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  Real estate taxes.    Real estate taxes were $1.1 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our dispositions of Las Colinas Commons and Northborough Tower accounted for a decrease of $0.3 million.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.6 million in our remaining properties. 
  Impairment charge.    During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $9.2 million.      We recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $2.2 million and $7 million to reduce the carrying values of Northpoint Central and our unconsolidated investment in Central Europe, respectively, to their estimated fair values.  During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $11.6 million.  We recorded non-cash impairment charges of $2.1 million and $2.7 million to reduce the carrying values of our Northborough Tower and Northpoint Central office buildings, respectively, to their estimated fair values.  During the third quarter of 2015, we also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $6.8 million to reduce the carrying value of our Frisco Square land to its estimated fair value based on an indication of a change in market conditions for land development. 
  Property management fees.    Property management fees remained fairly constant at $0.4 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  Asset management fees.    Asset management fees remained fairly constant at approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  General and administrative expense.    General and administrative expense was $1.8 million and $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The increase of approximately $0.5 million was primarily due to increases in expenses related to our asset valuation, legal, and audit fees.  
     Depreciation and amortization expense.    Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.6 million and $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The decrease of approximately $2.1 million for our disposed assets was partially offset by an increase of $0.4 million related to The Ablon at Frisco Square, which began operations in February 2016. 
  Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint venture.    Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint venture was a loss of less than $0.1 million and a loss of $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, our Central Europe Joint Venture recorded impairment charges of $2.6 million to bring certain assets to their fair value.  The Company's portion of the impairment was $1.2 million, which was recorded in

           (1) 
    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the 2016 dispositions of Las Colinas Commons and Northborough Tower.  
              (2) 
    Represents the dollar amount increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to The Ablon at Frisco Square, which began operations in February 2016. 
              (3) 
    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 with respect to real estate and real estate-related investments owned by us during the entire periods presented ( Same Store ).  Same Store for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes Chase Park Plaza, Frisco Square, Northpoint Central, The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera, and Royal Island. 
              (4) 
    Asset management fees payable to the Advisor are an obligation of the Company.  As such, asset management fees associated with all investments owned during the period are classified in continuing operations.  Therefore, the amounts above include asset management fees associated with any property owned during a particular period, including those related to our disposed properties.

Continuing Operations 
  Revenues.    Overall, our total revenues decreased by approximately $0.5 million to $41.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The change in revenues was primarily due to: 
             
    Rental revenue decreased $3.4 million to $11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $15 million for the third quarter of 2015.  The rental revenue decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $1.9 million in rental revenue for our Las Colinas Commons office building, which was sold on February 2, 2016, and a decrease of $2.5 million in rental revenue for our Northborough Tower office building, which was disposed on May 9, 2016.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million related to The Ablon at Frisco Square, which began operations in February 2016. 
                
    Hotel revenue increased $0.6 million to $27.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Hotel revenue for Chase Park Plaza Hotel increased approximately $0.1 million primarily due to an increase in miscellaneous income.  Hotel revenue at The Lodge   Spa at Cordillera increased $0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015 due primarily to a 19% increase in occupancy.  
     Property operating expenses.    Property operating expenses were approximately $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The $1 million decrease was due to a decrease of approximately $1.2 million related to our disposed assets and a decrease of $0.4 million at Frisco Square.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million related to The Ablon at Frisco Square, which began operations in February 2016. 
  Hotel operating expenses.    Hotel operating expenses were approximately $21.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $20.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, for an increase of $1 million.  Hotel operating expenses at our Chase Park Plaza Hotel increased approximately $0.9 million, primarily due to increases in administrative and marketing expenses.  Hotel operating expenses at The Lodge   Spa at Cordillera increased by less than $0.1 million period-over-period.  
  Bad debt expense.    Bad debt expense was less than $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, each. 
  Condominium inventory impairment.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded an impairment of $0.6 million associated with our one remaining condominium unit at Chase   The Private Residences.  This impairment was based on current market information and our decision to dispose of the asset in the nearer term.  We sold the condominium unit during the first quarter of 2016.  
  Interest expense.    Interest expense was approximately $7.2 million and $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The increase of $1 million in interest expense was primarily due to a $0.9 million increase at The Ablon at Frisco Square as a result of increases in the debt balance. 
  Real estate taxes.    Real estate taxes were approximately $3.1 million and $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The $0.7 million increase was primarily due to The Ablon at Frisco Square, which began operations in February 2016.  
  Impairment charge.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $9.2 million.      We recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $2.2 million and $7 million to reduce the carrying values of Northpoint Central and our unconsolidated investment in Central Europe, respectively, to their estimated fair values.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $11.6 million.  We recorded non-cash impairment charges of $2.1 million and $2.7 million to reduce the carrying values of our Northborough Tower and Northpoint Central office buildings, respectively, to their estimated fair values.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $6.8 million to reduce the carrying value of our Frisco Square land to its estimated fair value based on an indication of a change in market conditions for land development. 
     Property management fees.    Property management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2106 and 2015 were approximately $1.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively.  The $0.3 million decrease was primarily due to our disposed assets. 
  Asset management fees.    Asset management fees remained fairly constant at $1.6 million and $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

     Table of Contents  

General and administrative expense.    General and administrative expense was $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1 million compared to the expense for the same period in 2015.  The increase of approximately $1 million was primarily due to expenses related to our asset valuation, legal, and audit fees.  
  Depreciation and amortization expense.    Depreciation and amortization expense was $8 million and $10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The decrease of approximately $3.2 million related to our disposed assets was partially offset by an increase of $1 million related to The Ablon at Frisco Square, which began operations in February 2016. 
  Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint venture.    Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint venture was a gain of less than $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Gain on sale of real estate.    We sold our Las Colinas Commons office building complex on February 2, 2016 and recorded a gain of $1.3 million.  We sold a 5.2 acre undeveloped land parcel at Frisco Square on May 24, 2016 and recorded a gain of $1.7 million.  We had no sales of our consolidated properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Gain on extinguishment of debt.    The non-recourse loan for Northborough Tower matured on January 11, 2016, and we did not repay the debt.  We actively marketed the property for sale prior to the maturity, but we did not receive any offers above the loan balance.  On May 9, 2016 we transferred the property to the lender via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.  We recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.6 million.  We did not have any extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Cash Flow Analysis 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $0.6 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $3.9 million for the same period in 2015.  The primary reason for the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was the change in working capital, including the timing of receipts on accounts receivable and payments of accrued liabilities. 
  Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $12.1 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $26.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The difference is primarily due to $21.9 million of proceeds from the dispositions of Las Colinas Commons, Northborough Tower, and our Frisco Square land during the first nine months of 2016.  In addition, there was an approximate $18 million decrease in cash spent for capital improvements related to The Ablon at Frisco Square during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The Ablon at Frisco Square began operations in February 2016. 
  Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $11.5 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid off the existing indebtedness totaling approximately $11.3 million associated with the Las Colinas Commons investment and a $3.6 million excess principal payment to reduce Northpoint Central s loan balance with proceeds from the sale of the Las Colinas Commons asset.  Under the terms of the loan, the lender required a release price payment of $14.9 million to release the Las Colinas Commons property from the loan.  This was partially offset by draws of $7.6 million under the Ablon Frisco Square Venture construction loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   
  Funds from Operations 
  Funds from operations ( FFO ) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance.  As we have entered our disposition phase, we do not believe FFO is a meaningful measurement of our operating performance; therefore, we are no longer providing the calculation.

Table of Contents  

Distributions 
  Distributions are authorized at the discretion of our board of directors based on its analysis of our forthcoming cash needs, earnings, cash flow, anticipated cash flow, capital expenditure requirements, cash on hand, general financial condition, and other factors that our board deems relevant.  The board s decision will be influenced, in substantial part, by its obligation to ensure that we maintain our status as a REIT.  In connection with entering our disposition phase, on March 28, 2011, our board of directors discontinued regular quarterly distributions. 
  Historically, distributions paid to stockholders have been funded through various sources, including cash flow from operating activities, proceeds raised as part of our initial public offering, reinvestment through our distribution reinvestment plan, and/or additional borrowings.  We had no distributions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by our stockholders, we expect to sell all of our assets, pay for all of our known liabilities, provide for unknown liabilities, and distribute the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders.  There can be no assurances regarding the amounts or timing of any liquidating distributions. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  We evaluate these estimates, including investment impairment, on a regular basis.  These estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
  Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from the discussion found in the Management Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 18, 2016.

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We may be exposed to interest rate changes, primarily as a result of long-term variable rate debt used to acquire properties and make loans and other permitted investments.  Our management s objectives, with regard to interest rate risks, are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs.  To achieve these objectives, we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and in some cases, with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates.  With regard to variable rate financing, we will assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities.  We may enter into derivative financial instruments such as options, forwards, interest rate swaps, caps, or floors to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate portion of our variable rate debt.  Of our $142.5 million in notes payable, at September 30, 2016, $56.5 million represented debt subject to variable interest rates.  If our variable interest rates increased 100 basis points, we estimate that total annual interest cost, including interest expensed and interest capitalized, would increase by $0.6 million.  
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  At September 30, 2016, we own an approximate 47% interest in a joint venture consisting of 18 properties in the Czech Republic and Poland that holds $5.7 million in local currency-denominated accounts at European financial institutions.  As the cash is held in the same currency as the real estate assets and related loans, we believe that we are not materially exposed to any significant foreign currency fluctuations related to these accounts as it relates to ongoing property operations.  Additionally, we hold less than $0.1 million in a Euro-denominated account in a United States financial institution.  Material movements in the exchange rate of Euros could materially impact distributions from our foreign investments. 
  Inflation 
  The real estate market has not been affected significantly by inflation in the past several years due to the relatively low inflation rate.  However, we include provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that would protect us from the impact of inflation.  These provisions include reimbursement billings for common area maintenance charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per square foot allowance. 
   
  Item 4.               Controls and Procedures. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated, as of September 30, 2016, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) using the criteria established in   Internal Control - New Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in this report is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  We believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings. 
  We are not party to, and none of our properties are subject to, any material pending legal proceedings. 
   
  Item 1A.    Risk Factors.  
  Please see the risk factors below and those discussed in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 18, 2016 and in the Proxy Statement.  
  The vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union could adversely affect us 
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union ( Brexit ).  Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets.  This uncertainty could delay the disposition of our Central European properties or cause us to ultimately sell such assets for less than their current expected valuation.  
   
  Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
  Unregistered Sales of Common Stock 
  During the period covered by this quarterly report, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
  Share Redemption Program 
  In February 2006, our board of directors authorized a share redemption program for stockholders who held their shares for more than one year.  Under the program, our board reserved the right in its sole discretion at any time, and from time to time, to (1) waive the one-year holding period in the event of the death, disability or bankruptcy of a stockholder or other exigent circumstances, (2) reject any request for redemption, (3) change the purchase price for redemptions, or (4) terminate, suspend, or amend the share redemption program. 
  Our board of directors has not considered requests for redemptions ( Ordinary Redemptions ) for reasons other than in the event of death, disability or need for long-term care since March 2009 when the board determined not to accept, and to suspend until further notice, Ordinary Redemptions. 
  In January 2011, the board completely suspended the redemption program and has not considered any redemption requests since 2010.  Therefore, we did not redeem any shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  We have not presented information regarding submitted and unfulfilled redemptions as our share redemption program has been completely suspended since the first quarter of 2011 and we believe many stockholders who may otherwise desire to have their shares redeemed have not submitted a request due to the program s suspension. 
   Any redemption requests submitted while the program is suspended will be returned to investors and must be resubmitted upon resumption of the share redemption program.  As we have entered our disposition phase, we do not expect to resume our share redemption program; however, if the share redemption program is resumed, we will give all stockholders notice that we are resuming redemptions, so that all stockholders will have an equal opportunity to submit shares for redemption.  Upon resumption of the program, any redemption requests will be honored pro rata among all requests received based on funds available and will not be honored on a first come, first served basis.
