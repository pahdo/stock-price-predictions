1. Organization and Description of Business and Recent
Developments  

Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. and its
subsidiaries NW Bio Gmbh and Aracaris Capital, Ltd. (collectively, the  Company ,  we ,  us 
and  our ) were organized to discover and develop innovative immunotherapies for cancer. 

The Company s platform technology,
DCVax , is currently being tested for the treatment of certain types of cancers through clinical trials in the United States
and Europe. 

2. Liquidity and Financial Condition  

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company recognized net losses of $29.2 million and $49.5 million, respectively. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used approximately $9.8 million and $41.6 million of cash in its
operating activities respectively. 

These cash outflows included substantial
amounts of accrued costs relating to prior periods of higher activity and expenditures in the Company s Phase III clinical
trial which have subsequently been reduced, and included substantial amounts of legal costs which the Company anticipates may be
subject to reimbursement under the Company s insurance, with further legal expenses going forward being covered by insurance
directly. The Company had current assets of $2.3 million, accounts payable of $13.3 million and accounts payable to related party
of $11.8 million, convertible notes, net of $10.9 million and mortgage loans, net of $10.1 million. 

Because of recurring operating losses,
net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might become necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern. 

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated. Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period
presentation. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and on the same basis as the Company
prepares its annual audited consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016,
condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, condensed consolidated
statements of comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, condensed consolidated statement
of stockholders  equity (deficit) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the condensed consolidated statements
of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited, but include all adjustments, consisting only
of normal recurring adjustments, which the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating
results and cash flows for the periods presented. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future interim period. The condensed consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited financial statements; however, it does not include all of the
information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015,
and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 16, 2016, as
amended on April 29, 2016. 

Use of Estimates  

In preparing condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well
as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Due to inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual
results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in these estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its
estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include valuing equity securities in share-based payment arrangements,
valuing environmental liabilities, estimating the fair value of equity instruments recorded as derivative liabilities, and estimating
the useful lives of depreciable assets and whether impairment charges may apply. 

9   

Warrant Liability  

The Company accounts for certain common
stock warrants outstanding as a liability at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. This
liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in
the Company's statements of operations. The fair value of the warrants issued by the Company in connection with the conversion
transaction has been estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. 

Environmental Remediation Liabilities  

The Company records environmental remediation
liabilities for properties acquired. The environmental remediation liabilities are initially recorded at fair value. The liability
is reduced for actual costs incurred in connection with the clean-up activities for each property. Upon completion of the clean-up,
the environmental remediation liability is adjusted to equal the fair value of the remaining operation, maintenance and monitoring
activities to be performed for the property. The amount of the additional liability resulting from the completion of the clean-up,
if any, would be included in other income (expense). As of September 30, 2016, the Company estimated that the total environmental
remediation costs associated with the purchase of the UK Facility will be approximately $6.2 million. This is a projected potential
future cost. No such environmental costs have been incurred to date and none are currently pending. Contamination clean-up costs
that improve the property from its original acquisition state will be capitalized as part of the property s overall development
costs. The Company engaged a third party specialist to conduct certain surveys of the condition of the property which included,
among other things, a preliminary analysis of potential environmental remediation exposures. The Company determined, based on information
contained in the specialist s report, that it would be required to estimate the fair value of an unconditional obligation
to remediate specific ground contamination at an estimated fair value of approximately $6.2 million. The Company computed the fair
value of this obligation using a probability weighted approach that measures the likelihood of the following two potential outcomes:
(i) a higher probability requirement of erecting a protective barrier around the affected area at an estimated cost of approximately
$4.5 million, and (ii) a lower probability requirement of having to excavate the affected area at an estimated cost of approximately
$32.0 million. The Company s estimate is preliminary and therefore subject to change as further studies are conducted, and
as additional facts come to the Company s attention. Environmental remediation efforts are complex, technical and subject
to various uncertainties. Accordingly, it is at least reasonably possible that any changes in the Company s estimate could
materially differ from the management s preliminary assessment discussed herein.       

Comprehensive Loss  

The Company reports comprehensive loss
and its components in its condensed consolidated financial statements. Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and foreign currency
translation adjustments, affecting stockholders  equity (deficit) that, under U.S, GAAP, are excluded from net loss. 

Research and Development Costs  

Research and development costs are charged
to operations as incurred and consist primarily of clinical trial costs, related party manufacturing costs, consulting costs, contract
research and development costs, clinical site costs and compensation costs.  

Significant Accounting Policies  

There have been no material changes in
the Company s significant accounting policies to those previously disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report. 

Recent Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

Statement of Cash Flows  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows  (Topic 230). This amendment provides guidance on the presentation and classification of
specific cash flow items to improve consistency within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is
evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-15 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

Compensation-Stock Compensation  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . Under ASU
No. 2016-09, companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in capital ( APIC ).
Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement
and the APIC pools will be eliminated. In addition, ASU No. 2016-09 eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized
before companies can recognize them. ASU No. 2016-09 also requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity
on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. Furthermore, ASU No. 2016-09 will increase the amount an employer
can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to liability classification for shares used to
satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation. An employer with a statutory income tax withholding obligation
will now be allowed to withhold shares with a fair value up to the amount of taxes owed using the maximum statutory tax rate in
the employee s applicable jurisdiction(s). ASU No. 2016-09 requires a company to classify the cash paid to a tax authority
when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on the statement of
cash flows. Under current U.S. GAAP, it was not specified how these cash flows should be classified. In addition, companies will
now have to elect whether to account for forfeitures on share-based payments by (1) recognizing forfeitures of awards as they occur
or (2) estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjusting the estimate when it is likely to change, as is currently
required. The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption
permitted but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU No.
2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

10   

Revenue from Contracts with Customer  

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customer . The new guidance is an update to ASC 606 and provides clarity on:
identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation. For public companies, ASU No. 2016-10 is effective for annual
periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact that ASU No. 2016-10 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities  

In January 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-01,
 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments to be
measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments
without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; eliminates the requirement
for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required
to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; requires public business entities to
use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires an entity to
present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from
a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance
with the fair value option for financial instruments; requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities
by measurement category and form of financial assets on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements;
and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale
securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Leases  

In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842)  which supersedes FASB ASC Topic 840,  Leases (Topic 840)  and provides principles for the recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual
approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively
a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective
interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use
asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than twelve months regardless of classification. Leases with
a term of twelve months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The standard will be effective
for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted upon issuance. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

4. Fair Value Measurements  

Extinguishment of Derivative Liabilities
related to Cognate  

On May 2, 2016, the Company submitted a
remediation plan (the  Remediation Plan ) related to certain stock issued to Cognate to regain compliance with Nasdaq s
Rule 5635. The Remediation Plan was accepted by  Nasdaq on August 30, 2016.  

Pursuant to the Remediation Plan, the
Company canceled the most favored nation provisions related to warrants issued to Cognate under 2013 Manufacturing Services agreement
( 2013 Agreement ) and 2014 Manufacturing Services Agreements ( 2014 Agreements ) through a binding agreement
with Cognate. In addition, Cognate returned and the Company extinguished 6,880,574 warrants issued under the 2014 Agreements;
the Company issued replacement warrants of 4,305,772 at a higher exercise price. The aggregate fair value of the warrants extinguished
as of August 30, 2016 using Monte Carlo simulation was approximately $10.1 million, and was recorded through additional paid in
capital.

A summary of weighted average (in aggregate)
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) used in measuring Cognate warrant extinguishment as of August 30, 2016 is as follows: 

Extinguishment of Warrant Liabilities
Related to Cash Exercise   

During the quarter ended September 30,
2016 approximately 2,555,000 warrants classified as derivative liabilities were exercised for cash (see footnote 9).  A summary
of weighted average (in aggregate) significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) used in measuring warrant exercises (originally
recorded as liabilities) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

The development and determination of the
unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company s
management. 

The following table classifies the Company s
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 (in thousands): 

There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 during the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016. 

The following table presents changes in
Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. Both observable and unobservable
inputs were used to determine the fair value of positions that the Company has classified within the Level 3 category.
Unrealized gains and losses associated with liabilities within the Level 3 category include changes in fair
value that were attributable to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable (e.g., changes in unobservable
long- dated volatilities) inputs (in thousands). 

12   

The Company s warrant liabilities
are measured at fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology. A summary of the weighted average (in aggregate)
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) used in measuring the Company s warrant liabilities that are categorized

6. Notes Payable  

The following table summarizes outstanding debt as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (amount in thousands):  

(1) This $135,000 note as of September
30, 2016 consists of two separate 6% notes in the amounts of $110,000 and $25,000. In regard to the $110,000 note, the Company
has made ongoing attempts to locate the creditor to repay or convert this note, but has been unable to locate the creditor to date.
In regard to the $25,000 note, the holder has elected to convert these notes into equity, the Company has delivered the applicable
conversion documents to the holder, and the Company is waiting for the holder to execute and return the documents. 

(2) The Company has $0.7 million remaining
in escrowed interest payments, which is sufficient to fund, when due, the total aggregate amount of the two scheduled semi-annual
interest payments during the remaining term of the notes, excluding additional interest, if any. 

(3) On August 17, 2016, the lender issued
an automatic one year extension of the second mortgage loan maturity date to August 17, 2017 with a renewal fee of approximately
$0.2 million, which is not due until the end of the extension period and will be recorded as deferred financing cost.

7. Net Earnings (Loss) per Share Applicable
to Common Stockholders  

Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common
share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the determinants of basic net income per share and, in addition, gives effect to the
potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised, vested or converted
into common stock, unless they are anti-dilutive. Diluted weighted average common shares include common stock potentially issuable
under our convertible notes, vested and unvested stock options and unvested RSUs, except where the effect of including them is
anti-dilutive.

The following table summarizes the overall
and per-share earnings (loss) calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (in thousands,
except per share amount):  

For the periods where the Company reported losses, all common
stock equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, since the result would be anti-dilutive. (in

Cognate BioServices, Inc.   

Remediation Plan  

As previously reported, on April 26, 2016,
the Nasdaq Staff notified the Company that it had reviewed certain stock issuances by the Company to Cognate during 2014 and 2015,
and that the Staff had determined that those issuances should be aggregated for purposes of applying Nasdaq rules. Under Nasdaq
rules, for purposes of measuring against the limit of 20% of total shares outstanding, all of the stock issuances made by the Company
to Cognate during 2014 and 2015 were aggregated, and they were measured against only the shares outstanding in January 2014. 

15   

As a result the Company proposed a remediation
plan (the  Remediation Plan ) that Cognate would surrender certain shares and warrants it had received in connection
with the Contracts, Cognate would accept an increase in the exercise price of certain warrants received in connection with the
Contracts, and the most favored nation anti-dilution provisions would be deleted from the Contracts. 

The Remediation Plan was accepted by the Nasdaq staff
on August 30, 2016. Pursuant to the Remediation Plan: 

(a) Cognate returned and the Company canceled 8,052,092
restricted shares previously issued to Cognate under the most favored nation anti-dilution provisions of the Contracts, and the
most favored nation provisions were deleted from the Contracts on September 7, 2016; 

(b) Cognate returned and the Company canceled warrants
for 6,880,574 shares issued under the 2014 Agreements and the Company issued to Cognate new warrants for 4,305,772 shares at exercise
price of $4.27 with 5 years term; and 

(c) Cognate returned and the Company canceled 731,980
of the total of 5,101,330 restricted shares initially issued under the 2014 Agreements. 

The remaining portions of the multi-year lock-up and vesting
periods relating to shares and warrants held by Cognate were also cancelled.   

The Nasdaq settlement does not affect other obligations of the
Company to Cognate, including for existing unpaid invoices, as the Company has previously reported. 

Cognate Expenses and Accounts Payable  

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company owed Cognate $11.8 million and $5.5 million, respectively, for unpaid invoices for manufacturing, product distribution,
product and process development, and related services. 

The following table shows a summary of
research and development cost from Cognate relating to the DCVax-L and DCVax-Direct programs, product and process development work
and preparations for upcoming Phase II trials for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (in
thousands): 

Share Based Payments  

As of August 30, 2016, the research and
development expense associated with the remaining 731,980 shares of unvested stock payable to Cognate was approximately $221,000.
Pursuant to the Remediation Plan mentioned above, the Company cancelled the remaining unvested 731,980 shares without a replacement
of shares. The Company also cancelled 8,052,092 vested shares, which was recorded as reduction of shares outstanding. 

The Company recorded $8.9 million of income
and $9.4 million of expense for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for stock based payment
expense to Cognate through August 30, 2016 (the date of vesting). The fair value calculation of these shares was determined using
the market price for tradable shares. 

Shares payable to related party  
elimination of most favored nation provision  

Shares and warrants previously issued to
Cognate in partial payment of invoices for manufacturing services were under a 3-year lock-up, which had been in place since January
2014.  The lock-up prevented Cognate from selling the shares received. During the lock-up, if the Company entered
into a transaction with other investors or creditors on more favorable terms than Cognate received, the Company had an ongoing
obligation, under the Manufacturing Services Agreements, to conform the terms
of Cognate s shares and warrants to the same terms as the other investors or creditors, under a most favored nation provision. 

16   

During the nine months period ended September
30, 2016, the Company entered into several financings with unrelated institutional investors that triggered the most favored nation
provision (but which were not implemented, due to being cancelled and eliminated under the Remediation Agreement).  The first
reset occurred in February 2016, had an effective price of $1.70 and would have resulted in an obligation by the Company to issue
6.0 million shares to Cognate.  The second reset occurred in May 2016, had an effective price of $0.96 and would have resulted
in an obligation to issue an additional 12.0 million shares. The third reset occurred in July 2016, had an effective price
of $0.60 and would have resulted in an obligation to issue an additional 16.6 million shares. The final reset occurred in
August 2016, had an effective price of $0.35 and would have resulted in an obligation to issue an additional 31.6 million shares.  

None of these most favored nation shares were issued to Cognate. Under the Remediation Agreement, Cognate
agreed to eliminate the most favored nation provisions, and to forego all these shares that had already been triggered. As a result
of the elimination of the most favored nation, the Company reclassified $22.5 million shares payable which resulted in an increase
additional paid in capital. 

9. Stockholders  Equity (Deficit)  

Common Stock Issuances   

First Quarter of 2016   

On February 29, 2016, the Company entered
into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with certain institutional investors (the  Purchasers ),
for a registered direct offering (the  Offering ) of 5,882,353 shares (the  Shares ) of the Company s
Common Stock at the purchase price of $1.70 per share, and Series A Warrants (the  Series A Warrants ) to purchase
an additional 2,941,177 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $2.25 per share. The Series A Warrants will become exercisable
on the six month anniversary of issuance and expire five years thereafter. 

In addition, the Company granted the Purchasers
a sixty (60) day overallotment option in the form of Series B Warrants to purchase an additional 5,882,353 shares of Common Stock
at an exercise price of $3.00 per share (the  Series B Warrants ). The Series B Warrants were exercisable immediately
and were to expire within sixty (60) days. However, on May 2, 2016, the Company and the investors agreed to extend this warrant
exercise period by twenty-one (21) days, from May 2 to May 23, 2016. The Company and the Purchasers consummated the purchase and
sale of the Securities on March 3, 2016 (the  Closing ) and the Company raised gross proceeds of $10 million and net
proceeds of approximately $9.2 million, after deducting placement agent fees, attorneys  fees and other expenses. Subsequent
to the reporting period, the Series B Warrants were extended an additional twenty-one (21) days to May 23, 2016. 

Each Purchaser also received Series C Warrants
(the  Series C Warrants ) to purchase up to 2,941,177 shares of Common Stock. The Series C Warrants vest and become
exercisable only if, and to the extent that, the Series B Warrants held by such Purchaser are exercised. The Series C warrants
will be issuable and exercisable for one-half share of Common Stock per each Series B Warrant exercised. The Series C Warrants
have an exercise price of $4.00 per share, shall be exercisable on the six-month anniversary of issuance and will expire five years
thereafter. 

In connection with the Offering and the
concurrent private placement, the Company agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash placement fee equal to 7% of the aggregate purchase
price for the common stock sold in the registered offering. The Placement Agent also received Common Stock purchase warrants (the
 Compensation Warrants ) to purchase up to 294,118 shares of Common Stock, or 5% of the aggregate number of shares
of common Stock sold in the registered offering, at an exercise price of $2.125, or 125% of the public offering price per share
in the registered offering, which are exercisable six months following issuance and terminate on February 29, 2021. 

Second Quarter of 2016   

On May 15, 2016, the Company entered into
an agreement with a holder (the  Holder ) of the Company s existing Series A, B and C Warrants, pursuant to which
the Holder agreed to exercise all of the Holder s Series B Warrants to purchase 4,411,764 shares of Common Stock. In consideration,
the Company agreed to reduce the exercise price of the Series B Warrants to $0.96 per share, the Company s closing price
on the prior trading day, for gross proceeds of approximately $4,235,000, and agreed to issue new Series D Common Stock Purchase
Warrants (the  Series D Warrants ) to purchase up to 2,205,882 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.00
per share (subject to customary adjustments such as for stock splits and dividends), with an exercise period of five years, commencing
six months after issuance. 

17   

The Holder s exercise of the Series
B Warrants to purchase 4,411,764 shares of Common Stock triggered the existing outstanding Series C Warrants to become vested and
exercisable for up to 2,205,882 shares of Common Stock. The Company agreed to reset the exercise price of the Series A and Series
C Warrants to $1.00 per share. 

In connection with the offering and the
concurrent private placement, the Company agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash placement fee equal to 7% of the aggregate purchase
price for the common stock sold. The Placement Agent also received Common Stock purchase warrants (the  Compensation Warrants )
to purchase up to 220,588 shares of Common Stock, or 5% of the aggregate number of shares of common Stock sold, at an exercise
price of $1.20, or 125% of the public offering price per share, which are exercisable six months following issuance and terminate
on May 15, 2021. 

The modification of the warrant exercise
price increased the value of the warrants by approximately $2.6 million. This cost was recorded as a deemed dividend in additional
paid-in capital due to the absence of retained earnings. This cost is included in modification of warrants and increased the net
loss available to common shareholders on the condensed, consolidated statements of operations. 

Third Quarter of 2016   

During the quarter ended September 30,
2016, the Company issued 7,400,000 shares of common stock at $0.50 per share, and warrants to purchase an additional 3,700,000
shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.60 per share with five years term through a registered direct offering. The Company
received net proceeds of approximately $3.4 million, after deducting aggregate placement agent fees and attorneys  fees of
approximately $321,000. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered
into multiple agreements with certain holders (the  Holders ) of the Company s existing warrants, pursuant to
which the Holders agreed to exercise all of the Holders  warrants to purchase 10,945,694 shares of common stock. In consideration,
the Company agreed to reduce the exercise price of the warrants to $0.35 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $3.4 million,
after deducting aggregate placement agent fees, attorneys  fees and bank clearing fees of approximately $454,000, and agreed
to issue new common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to 10,945,694 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise
price of $0.44 per share, with an exercise period of 5 years, commencing 6 months after issuance. In connection with the registered
direct offering, the Company granted 263,122 warrants at an exercise price of $0.44 to the placement agents. The placement agent
warrants are exercisable 6 months following issuance and terminate on February 22, 2022. 

The modification of the warrant exercise
price increased the value of the warrants by approximately $3.0 million. This cost was recorded as a deemed dividend in additional
paid-in capital due to the absence of retained earnings. This cost is included in modification of warrants and increased the net
loss available to common shareholders on the condensed, consolidated statements of operations. 

During the quarter ended September 30,
2016, the Company issued a total of 2,572,216 shares of Common stock at $0.36 per share to several angel investors for aggregate
proceeds of $0.9 million. The Company also issued 1,286,111 warrants at an exercise price of $0.42 per share, with an exercise
period of 5 years. 

On September 16, 2016, the Company converted
a note in dispute and relevant accrued interest of $1.0 million into 2,222,222 shares of common stock.  The fair value
of the common shares on the issuance date was approximately $1.0 million. In addition, the Company issued 1,111,111 warrants at
an exercise price of $0.45 with an exercise period of 5 years, commencing 6 months after issuance. The fair value of the warrants
was approximately $0.4 million using a Black-Scholes model at the date of issuance related to the conversion of note and accrued
interest. The total loss on extinguishment of debt recorded on the statement of operations was approximately $0.4 million related to this conversion.

provisions). 

10. Contingencies  

Derivative and Class Action Litigation  

In 2014, as previously reported, the Company
received demand letters from three purported individual shareholders seeking to inspect our corporate books and records pursuant
to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The demand letters were all substantially similar, and claimed that their
purpose is to investigate possible mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duty by the Company s directors and officers. 
They requested a range of documents.  On November 13, 2014, one of the purported shareholders filed a complaint in the Delaware
Court of Chancery seeking to enforce her books and records demand. The Company reached negotiated agreements and provided limited
records, under confidentiality agreements. On July 16, 2015, the parties filed, and the court entered, a stipulation dismissing
the case. 

19   

On June 19, 2015, two of the purported
shareholders filed a complaint purportedly suing on behalf of a class of similarly situated shareholders and derivatively on behalf
of the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery.  The lawsuit names Cognate BioServices, Inc., Toucan Partners, Toucan Capital
Fund III, our CEO Linda Powers and the Company s Board of Directors as defendants, and names the Company as a  nominal
defendant  with respect to the derivative claims.  The complaint generally objects to certain transactions between
the Company and Cognate and the Toucan entities, in which Cognate and the Toucan entities provided services and financing to the
Company, or agreed to conversion of debts owed to them by the Company into equity.  The complaint seeks unspecified monetary
relief for the Company and the plaintiffs, and various forms of equitable relief, including disgorgement of allegedly improper
benefits, rescission of the challenged transactions, and an order forbidding similar transactions in the future.  On September
1, 2015, the Company and other named defendants filed motions to dismiss.  In response, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint
on November 6, 2015. The Company and the other named defendants filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs  amended complaint on
January 19, 2016. The plaintiffs filed an answering brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss on April 4, 2016. The Company
and the other defendants filed reply briefs on May 18, 2016. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend the case.  

On November 19, 2015, a third purported
shareholder who had sought corporate books and records filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland,
claiming to sue derivatively on behalf of the Company. The complaint names the Company's Board of Directors, Toucan Capital Fund
III, L.P., Toucan General II, LLC, Toucan Partners, LLC, and Cognate as defendants, and names the Company as a nominal defendant.
The complaint claims that the plaintiff made a demand on the Company's Board of Directors to commence an action against the Company's
directors and its CEO and that the plaintiff commenced the derivative action after not receiving a response to the demand letter
within an allegedly  sufficient time.  The complaint further claims that the Company purportedly overcompensated Cognate
and Toucan for certain services and loans in payments of stock, and that the Company's CEO, Ms. Powers, benefited from these transactions
with Cognate and Toucan, which she allegedly owns or controls. The complaint asserts that the alleged overpayments unjustly enriched
Ms. Powers, Toucan, and Cognate. The Complaint also claims that the Company's directors breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty
and good faith to the Company by authorizing the payments to Cognate. Finally, the complaint claims that Ms. Powers, Cognate, and
Toucan aided and abetted the directors' breaches of fiduciary duties by causing the board to enter into the agreements with Cognate.
The plaintiff seeks an award of unspecified damages to the Company and seeks equitable remedies, including disgorgement by Ms.
Powers, Toucan, and Cognate of the allegedly improper benefits received as a result of the disputed transactions. The plaintiff
also seeks costs and disbursements associated with bringing suit, including attorneys' fees and expert fees. On February 2, 2016,
plaintiff and defendants filed a joint motion to stay the proceedings pending an investigation by a special committee of the Company's
Board of Directors into the allegations asserted in the demand letter and underlying the lawsuit. The court entered the stay on
March 18, 2016. The Company intends to vigorously defend the case. 

Class Action Securities Litigation  

On August 26, 2015, a purported shareholder
of the Company filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  The lawsuit
names the Company and Ms. Powers as defendants.  On December 14, 2015, the court appointed two lead plaintiffs. The Lead Plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint on February 12, 2016, purportedly on behalf of all of those who purchased common stock in NW Bio between
January 13, 2014 and August 21, 2015. The amended complaint generally claims that the defendants violated Section 10(b) and Section
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making misleading statements and/or omissions on a variety of subjects, including
the status and results of the Company s DCVax trials.  The amended complaint seeks unspecified damages, attorneys 
fees, and costs. The Company and Ms. Powers filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs  amended complaint on April 12, 2016.  The
plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on June 13, 2016. The Company and Ms. Powers filed a reply in support of
their motion to dismiss on July 28, 2016. The Company intends to vigorously defend the case. 

Shareholder Books and Record Demand  

On December 7, 2015, the Company received
a letter on behalf of shareholders demanding to inspect certain corporate books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law. The demand letter claimed that its purpose was to investigate: (1) allegedly improper transactions, misconduct,
and mismanagement by directors and an officer of the Company; (2) the possible breach of fiduciary duty by certain directors and
officers of the Company; and (3) the independence and disinterestedness of the Company s board, to determine whether a pre-suit
demand would be necessary before commencing any derivative action on behalf of the Company. The Company has appointed a special
committee of its Board of Directors consisting of independent and disinterested directors to investigate the allegations set forth
in the demand letter, as well as the allegations asserted in the litigation summarized above. 

11. Subsequent Events  

Debt Financing   

As the Company previously reported, in
late October and thereafter the Company engaged in discussions with institutional investors interested in providing financing.
Under Nasdaq rules, the number of shares which the Company may issue is limited in certain types of transactions (and not similarly
limited in other types of transactions).  The number of shares which the investors were interested to purchase may exceed
the maximum number of shares issuable by the Company in the type of transaction contemplated.  While this issue is being addressed,
the Company has entered into a debt financing.  

On November 4, 2016, the Company entered
into Promissory Note Agreements (the  Notes ) for $2.5 million principal amount. The Notes are not convertible;
they have one-year maturity and 10% annual interest, with the interest payable at maturity. No equity or derivative equity securities
were issued in connection with this transaction.  

Nasdaq Issue  

In connection with the discussions with
interested investors, the Company contacted Nasdaq to make the necessary filings for Listing of Additional Shares and to pursue
a determination of the maximum number of shares the Company may issue to investors. On November 1, 2016, the Company submitted
to Nasdaq information about the Company s prior financing transactions during the preceding six-month period. On November
7, 2016, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that certain of the Company s financing transactions did not
comply with Nasdaq rules. The Nasdaq Staff had determined to aggregate a series of transactions that were completed with various
unrelated parties between May 15, 2016 and October 13, 2016 for purposes of assessing whether the 20% threshold for shareholder
approval had been triggered for issuances priced below the applicable market price. These transactions included repricing of existing
common stock purchase warrants and issuances of new common shares and common stock purchase warrants. 

The Company and its representatives are
in discussions with the Nasdaq Staff regarding available avenues for remediation, and the Company intends to submit its plan of
remediation to Nasdaq on or before the November 18, 2016 deadline established by Nasdaq. If Nasdaq does not accept the plan of
remediation, Nasdaq may issue a notice of delisting. The Company would then have the right to request a hearing before an independent
Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the  Panel ). A request for a hearing would stay any suspension or delisting action
pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel. The Panel would have the discretion
to grant the Company an extension period of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the delisting letter within which the Company
would be required to demonstrate compliance with all applicable listing requirements. 

Sale of Common Stock and Issuance of Warrants in a Private
Placement  

In October 2016, the Company issued 740,909
shares of Common stock at $0.44 per share to several angel investors for aggregate proceeds of $326,000. The Company also issued
370,456 warrants at an exercise price of $0.52 per share, with an exercise period of five years. 

Issuance of Common Shares in Satisfaction of Outstanding Obligations  

On October 13, 2016, the Company converted
accrued interest of $0.5 million into 1,111,111 shares of common stock.  In conjunction with the conversion, the Company
issued 555,556 warrants at an exercise price of $0.45 with an exercise period of 5 years, commencing 6 months after issuance. 

Assignment Agreement with Related Party  

As previously reported, on October 13, 2016 the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the  Agreement )
with Cognate and related agreements in connection with an institutional financing of Cognate and to enable the Company to continue
obtaining services from Cognate for the Company s ongoing Phase III DCVax -L trial and upcoming Phase II DCVax -Direct
trials. As an initial implementation step pursuant to the Agreement, on October 13, 2016 the Company entered into an Assignment
and Assumption Agreement (the  Assignment Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company agreed to assume certain Cognate
debt obligations in connection with preparations for initiation of Phase II clinical trials and further services in ongoing trials.
The Company s prior report noted that the third party lender and the Company were negotiating to finalize the arrangements
related to this Assumption and that the Company planned to report the results in a future periodic filing. Based on discussions
to date, the Company anticipates that, over a period of up to a year, the obligations could total an amount up to approximately
$5 million. The Company will report on the results of further negotiations and finalization in a future periodic filing. To discharge
an initial obligation of $480,000, the Company issued to the lender 1 million shares of common stock at $0.48 per share.

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and the notes to those statements included with this report. In addition to historical information, this report contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Such forward-looking statements
are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. The words
 believe,   expect,   intend,   anticipate,  and similar expressions are used to
identify forward-looking statements, but some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. Many factors could affect our
actual results, including those factors described under  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015 and in Part II Item 1A of this report. These factors, among others, could cause results to differ materially from those
presently anticipated by us. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 

Overview  

We are a biotechnology company focused
on developing immunotherapy products to treat cancers more effectively than current treatments, without toxicities of the kind
associated with chemotherapies, and, through a proprietary batch manufacturing process, on a cost-effective basis, initially in
the United States, Canada and Europe. 

We have developed a platform technology,
DCVax , which uses activated dendritic cells to mobilize a patient's own immune system to attack their cancer. The DCVax technology
is expected to be applicable to all solid tumor cancers, and is embodied in several distinct product lines. One of the product
lines (DCVax -L) is designed to cover all solid tumor cancers in which the tumors can be surgically removed. Another product
line (DCVax -Direct) is designed for all solid tumor cancers which are considered inoperable and cannot be surgically removed.
We believe the broad applicability of DCVax to many cancers provides multiple opportunities for commercialization and partnering. 

Our DCVax platform technology involves
dendritic cells, the master cells of the immune system, and is designed to reinvigorate and educate the immune system to attack
cancers. The dendritic cells are able to mobilize the overall immune system, including T cells, B cells and antibodies, natural
killer cells and many others. Such mobilization of the overall immune system provides a broader attack on the cancer than mobilizing
just a particular component, such as T cells alone, or a particular antibody alone. Likewise, our DCVax technology is designed
to attack the full set of biomarkers, or antigens, on a patient s cancer, rather than just a particular selected target or
several targets. Clinical experience indicates that when just one or a few biomarkers on a cancer are targeted by a drug or other
treatment, sooner or later the cancer usually develops a way around that drug, and the drug stops working. We believe that mobilizing
the overall immune system, and targeting the full set of biomarkers on the patient s cancer, contributes to the effectiveness
of DCVax. 

Our lead product, DCVax-L, is in an ongoing
Phase III trial for newly diagnosed Glioblastome multiforme (GBM), with over 60 trial sites as of December 31, 2015. GBM is the
most aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer, and is an  orphan disease.  The trial is on partial clinical
hold for screening of new patients for further enrollment; however, over 300 of the planned 348 patients are enrolled in the trial,
and the patients already in the trial have continued to be treated in accordance with the trial protocol, without interruption. 
The Company is in ongoing dialog with regulators in regard to the partial hold. 

Our second product, DCVax-Direct, is being
studied in a 60-patient Phase I/II trial for inoperable solid tumors. The 40-patient Phase I stage of the trial has been completed
except for ongoing follow-up on long-term survivor patients. The Company is working on preparations for Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct. 

We have undertaken lower levels of fundraising
as our research and development costs have been substantially lower during the current posture of our DCVax-L and DCVax-Direct
programs. We plan to increase our fundraising activities as the upcoming Phase II trials become ready for enrollment and execution.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. 

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates
and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We based our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Our critical accounting policies and significant
estimates are detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our critical accounting policies
and significant estimates have not changed substantially from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015.

Results of Operations  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized
a net loss of $49.5 million (cash and non-cash combined) versus a net loss of $90.7 million (cash and non-cash combined) for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company used approximately $9.8 million and $41.6 million of cash in its operating activities respectively. 

These cash outflows included substantial
amounts of accrued costs relating to prior periods of higher activity and expenditures in the Company s Phase III clinical
trial which have subsequently been reduced, and included substantial amounts of legal costs which the Company anticipates may
be subject to reimbursement under the Company s insurance, with further legal expenses going forward being covered by insurance
directly. 

Operating costs:   

Operating costs and expenses consist primarily
of research and development expenses, including clinical trial expenses which increase when we are actively participating in clinical
trials and are especially high when we are in a large ongoing international Phase III trial, as well as undertaking product and
process development, and preparing for multiple Phase II trials. 

Operating costs and expenses consist primarily
of research and development expenses, including clinical trial expenses which increase when we are actively participating in clinical
trials and are especially high when we are in a large ongoing international Phase III trial, as well as undertaking product and
process development, and preparing for multiple Phase II trials. 

Our operating costs include ongoing development
work relating to our DCVax products and their manufacturing, such as the development, testing and optimization of different product
preparations and methods, the design, engineering, sourcing, production, testing, modification and validation of manufacturing
automation systems, disposable sets to be used with the manufacturing automation systems, and manufacturing processes, product
ingredients, product release assays, and other matters, as well as development of standard operating procedures (SOPs), batch production
records, and other necessary materials. 

In our DCVax-L program, our operating costs
also include the costs of continuing our ongoing Phase III trial in the US, UK, Germany and Canada (with DCVax-L for brain cancer),
and early access programs in Europe. 

In our DCVax-Direct program, our operating
costs include preparations for multiple Phase II trials. The preparation costs include product and process development, upfront
payments to the clinical trial sites and the CROs managing the trials and other service providers, and legal, regulatory and expert
expenses related to regulatory approvals, institutional approvals and clinical trial agreements with each site, database development,
training of medical and other site personnel, trial supplies and other. Additional substantial costs relate to the expansion of
manufacturing facilities and capacity, in both the US and Europe. 

We have undertaken lower levels of fundraising
as our research and development costs have been substantially lower during the current posture of our DCVax-L and DCVax-Direct
programs. We plan to increase our fundraising activities as the upcoming Phase II trials become ready for enrollment and execution. 

Research and development:   

Discovery and preclinical research and
development expenses include costs for external technical and regulatory advisers, scientific or medical personnel and others,
costs of laboratory supplies and equipment used in research and development projects, travel, regulatory compliance, and expenditures
for preclinical and clinical trial operation and management when we are actively engaged in clinical trials. 

Because we are a pre-revenue company, we
do not allocate research and development costs on a project basis. We adopted this policy, in part, due to the unreasonable cost
burden associated with accounting at such a level of detail and our limited number of financial and personnel resources. 

General and administrative:   

General and administrative expenses include
both cash and non-cash measures. The cash expenses also include large amounts of legal fees and related expenses, large amounts
of external expert consultants (including statisticians, regulatory advisers in multiple countries and others), and substantial
intellectual property costs, in addition to Company operating costs, salary and benefit expenses, cost of facilities, insurance
and travel, property and equipment. The non-cash expenses include stock-based compensation and depreciation. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
and 2015  

For the three months ended September 30,
2016, we recognized a net loss of approximately $29.2 million (cash and non-cash combined) (including $11.4 million of non-cash
liability for most favored nation share issuance obligations, which was recorded as research and development expense and which
was subsequently cancelled and eliminated in the Remediation Agreement with Cognate) versus net income of $22.6 million (cash and
non-cash combined) for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded loss of approximately $0.2 million related to the change in fair value of derivative liability. For the period ended September
30, 2015, the Company recorded additional income of approximately $36.5 million expense related to the change in fair value of
derivative liabilities. 

22   

Research and Development Expense  

Research and development expense was approximately
$21.1 million (comprised of approximately $6.8 million of cash expenses for clinical programs, including substantial accrued expenses
from prior periods, and $11.4 of non-cash liability for most favored nation share issuance obligations, which obligations were
subsequently cancelled and eliminated in the Remediation Agreement with Cognate) for the three months ended September 30, 2016
versus $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we made cash payments of approximately $2.4 million, and $7.1 million, respectively, to Cognate. At September 30,
2016 and 2015, we owed Cognate $11.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, for unpaid invoices for DCVax-L and DCVax-Direct programs,
product and process development work and preparations for upcoming Phase II trials. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we incurred non-cash equity based benefit and expense (restricted common stock and warrants) for the applicable
pro rata portion of the ongoing vesting (in equal monthly installments over 3 years) of the one-time initiation payments of shares
and warrants under the four agreements the Company entered into with Cognate in January 2014. The Company recorded $0.7 million
of income and $6.4 million income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was due to the drop in share price compared with the prior period. The fair value calculation of these
shares was determined using the market price for tradable shares. The multi-year lock-up and vesting were cancelled pursuant to
the Remediation Agreement entered on August 30, 2016. 

General and Administrative Expense  

General and administrative expense was
approximately $4.6 million (cash and non-cash expenses combined) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus $4.4 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Aggregate costs are consistent with last year; however, this includes a large increase
in legal costs and substantial reductions in other costs The Company anticipates substantial portions of the large legal costs
will be subject to reimbursement under the Company s insurance, with further legal expenses going forward being covered by
insurance directly. 

Inducement Loss  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, we recorded inducement loss of $1.5 million related to the extinguishment and modification on warrant liabilities. 

Change in fair value of derivatives  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 we recognized a non-cash loss of approximately $0.2 million and gain of approximately $36.5 million, respectively,
on the fair value of derivative liability. The significant reduction relates to the change in the fair value of the derivative
liability which was due to all Cognate derivative liabilities that were extinguished pursuant to the Remediation Plan. 

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt  

During the three months ended September
30 2016, we recorded loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.4 million related to the conversion of $1.0 million debt
and accrued interest to common stock and warrants. The fair value of the common stock and warrants were approximately $1.4 million,
and the excess amount was recorded as inducement cost. 

Interest Expense  

The Company s reduction in outstanding
debt resulted in a reduction of interest expense. Interest expense (including non-cash elements such as amortization of debt discount
and debt issuance cost) was approximately $0.7 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Foreign currency transaction loss  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized foreign currency transaction loss of approximately $0.9 million and gain of approximately $0.4
million, respectively. The increased loss is due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound sterling. 

23   

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
and 2015  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 we recognized a net loss of $49.5 million (cash and non-cash combined) (including $13.7 million of non-cash liability for
most favored nation share issuance obligations, which was recorded as research and development expense and which was subsequently
cancelled and eliminated in the Remediation Agreement with Cognate) versus a net loss of $90.7 million (cash and non-cash combined)
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded additional
income of $17.2 million and additional expense of $12.4 million, respectively, related to the change in fair value of its derivative
liability. 

Research and Development Expense  

Research and development expense was $43.2
million (including $13.7 million of non-cash liability for most favored nation share issuance obligations, which was recorded as
research and development expense and which was subsequently cancelled and eliminated in the Remediation Agreement with Cognate)
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $56.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was
primarily due to decreased non-cash manufacturing and services costs as described below. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we made cash payments of approximately $12.4 million, and $28.4 million, respectively, to Cognate. At September
30, 2016 and 2015, we owed Cognate $11.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, for unpaid invoices for DCVax-L and DCVax-Direct
programs, product and process development work and preparations for upcoming Phase II trials. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we incurred non-cash equity based benefit and expense (restricted common stock and warrants) for the applicable
pro rata portion of the ongoing vesting (in equal monthly installments over 3 years) of the one-time initiation payments of shares
and warrants under the four agreements the Company entered into with Cognate in January 2014. The Company recorded $8.9 million
of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $9.4 million expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

General and Administrative Expense  

General and administrative expense was
$15.3 million (cash and non-cash combined) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $19.2 million (cash and non-cash
combined) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The overall decrease in general and administrative expenses resulted from
substantial reductions in the use of external consultants and other costs, offsetting large increases in legal costs during the
period. 

Inducement Loss  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we recorded inducement loss of $1.5 million related to the extinguishment and modification on warrant liabilities. 

Change in fair value of derivatives  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a non-cash gain of $17.2 million and a non-cash loss of $12.4 million, respectively, on the fair
value of derivative liability. The change in the fair value of the derivative liability during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was due to a decrease in our stock price compared to December 31, 2015. 

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt  

During the nine months ended September
30 2016, we recorded loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.4 million related to the conversion of $1.0 million debt and accrued
interest to common stock and warrants. The fair value of the common stock and warrants were approximately $1.4 million, and the
excess amount was recorded as inducement cost. 

Interest Expense  

The Company s reduction in outstanding
debt resulted in a reduction of interest expense. Interest expense (including non-cash elements such as amortization of debt discount
and debt issuance cost) was $2.1 million and $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We have experienced recurring losses from
operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash outflows from operations were $41.6 million and
$56.5 million, respectively. These cash outflows included substantial amounts of accrued costs relating to prior periods of higher
activity and expenditures in the Company s Phase III clinical trial which have subsequently been reduced, and included substantial
amounts of legal costs which the Company anticipates may be subject to reimbursement under the Company s insurance, with
further legal expenses going forward being covered by insurance directly. 

24   

At September 30, 2016, the Company had
current assets of $2.3 million, accounts payable of $13.3 million and accounts payable to related party of $11.8 million, convertible
notes, net of $10.9 million and mortgage loans, net of $10.1 million. 

Operating Activities   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, net cash outflows from operations were $41.6 million and $56.5 million, respectively. 

Investing Activities   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we used $4.8 million and $4.0 million to capitalize costs related to the UK facility and UK facility purchase,
respectively. 

Financing Activities   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, our financing activities provided net proceeds after expenses of $20.8 million and $52.6 million, respectively.
The $20.8 million in the nine months ended September 2016 consisted of $12.6 million from registered direct offerings, $0.9 million
from private offering, and $7.3 million from warrants exercised for cash. The $52.6 million in the nine months ended September
2015 consisted of $40.0 million proceeds from issuance of common stock, $7.4 million proceeds from the exercise of warrants, and
$5 million in net mortgage loan proceeds. 

Our financial statements indicate there
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as we are dependent on our ability to obtain ongoing financing
and ultimately to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis.  We can give no assurance
that our plans and efforts to achieve the above steps will be successful. 

Other factors affecting our ongoing funding
requirements include the number of staff we employ, the number of sites and number of patients still undergoing treatment in our
Phase III brain cancer trial, the costs of further product and process development work relating to our DCVax products, the costs
of preparations for multiple Phase II trials, the costs of expansion of manufacturing, the cost of pursuing our Hospital Exemption
program and potential reimbursements in Germany, and unanticipated developments. The extent of resources available to us will determine
which programs can move forward and at what pace. 

Nasdaq Listing  

The Company s common stock is listed
on The Nasdaq Capital Market ( Nasdaq ) under the symbol  NWBO.  One of the requirements for continued
listing on Nasdaq is maintenance of a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. On June 24, 2016, the Company received a letter
(the  Notice ) from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq ) notifying
the Company that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the  Common
Stock ) for the 30 consecutive business days preceding receipt of such letter, the Common Stock no longer met the requirement
to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 

In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule
5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been granted a period of 180 days, or until December 21, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum
bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company s common stock must meet or exceed $1.00
per share for at least 10 consecutive business days during this 180-day period. 

The Company intends to monitor the closing
bid price of its common stock on an ongoing basis, and consider a range of available options to regain compliance with the share
price listing standard. The Company could remedy the deficiency, either now or at a later date, through a reverse stock split.
However, the Company currently plans to regain compliance by focusing on progress in its operational programs. 

In the event the Company does not regain
compliance by December 21, 2016, the Company may be eligible for a second 180-day grace period if it meets the initial listing
standards (with the exception of the bid price and market value of publicly held shares requirements) for The Nasdaq Capital Market,
and provides written notice to Nasdaq of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second 180-day grace period, by effecting
a reverse stock split, if necessary, and satisfying any other applicable requirements. If the Company does not regain compliance
within the allotted compliance period(s), Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company s common stock will be subject to delisting.
At that time, the Company would be entitled to a hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the  Panel ).
The hearing request would automatically stay any suspension or delisting action until the issuance of the hearing decision and
the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel. 

On April 26, 2016, the Company received
a letter (the  Letter ) from the Nasdaq Staff indicating that the Staff had reviewed certain stock issuances by the
Company to Cognate BioServices, Inc. ( Cognate ), and had determined that those issuances did not comply with Nasdaq
Listing Rules 5635(c) and (d). On May 2, 2016, the Company submitted a remediation plan related to certain stock issued to Cognate
to regain compliance with Nasdaq s Rule 5635. The Remediation Plan was accepted by Nasdaq on August 30, 2016. 

25   

On November 7, 2016, the Company received
a letter from Nasdaq indicating that certain of the Company s financing transactions did not comply with Nasdaq rules. The
Nasdaq Staff had determined to aggregate a series of transactions that were completed with various unrelated parties between May
15, 2016 and October 13, 2016 for purposes of assessing whether the 20% threshold for shareholder approval had been triggered for
issuances priced below the applicable market price. These transactions included repricing of existing common stock purchase warrants
and issuances of new common shares and common stock purchase warrants. 

The Company and its representatives are
in discussions with the Nasdaq Staff regarding available avenues for remediation, and the Company intends to submit its plan of
remediation to Nasdaq on or before the November 18, 2016 deadline established by Nasdaq. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

Since our inception, we have not engaged
in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

Market risk represents the risk of loss
that may result from the change in value of financial instruments due to fluctuations in its market price. Market risk is inherent
in all financial instruments. Market risk may be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from
transacting in normal quantities and/or at normal bid-offer spreads. Our exposure to market risk is directly related to derivatives,
debt and equity linked instruments related to our financing activities. 

Our assets and liabilities are overwhelmingly
denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments to manage changes in currency
rates. We do not now, nor do we plan to, use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. However, these
circumstances might change. 

The primary quantifiable market risk associated
with our financial instruments is sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk represents the potential loss from
adverse changes in market interest rates. We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure.
For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12-month period
from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive financial instruments will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate
100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption
that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same
degree. We do not believe that our cash and equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. 

The sensitivity analyses of the interest
rate sensitive financial instruments are hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on a 1% or 2%
variation in an estimate generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the estimate to the change
in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular estimate on the fair value of financial instruments
is calculated independent of changes in any other estimate; in practice, changes in one factor may result in changes in another
factor, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. In addition, the sensitivity analyses do not consider any action that
we may take to mitigate the impact of any adverse changes in the key estimates. 

Based on our analysis, as of September
30, 2016, the effect of a 100+/- basis point change in interest rates on the value of our financial instruments and the resultant
effect on our net loss are considered immaterial. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

Our Company s finance and accounting
functions are performed by an external firm on a contract services basis.  This firm specializes in providing finance and
accounting functions for biotech companies, and the founders and senior managers are highly experienced former partners of national
accounting firms. The number and seniority of personnel in the external firm performing the finance and accounting functions for
the Company were increased during 2015. In addition, during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company retained a full-time
controller. Further, during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company engaged a second external firm: one that specializes in
Sarbanes-Oxley matters and helping public companies improve their disclosure controls and procedures. Together with these two external
firms and our controller, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule
13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.    

Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, our principal executive, financial and accounting officer concluded that during the period covered by
this report, our Company s processes for internally reporting material information in a systematic manner to allow for timely
filing of material information were significantly improved compared with prior periods, but were not effective, due to inherent
limitations from being a small company, and there remain some material weaknesses as described below. We have been working together
with the two external firms and our controller to further mitigate the remaining weaknesses, as also described below.    

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

As of the date of this filing, the Company
has completed remediation or made substantial progress towards remediation of the material weaknesses identified in the Company s
annual report on Form 10-K, filed in March 2016. 

26   

During the quarter ended June 30,
2016, we conducted a comprehensive entity-wide risk assessment to evaluate and ultimately report on risks to financial reporting
throughout the organization. Following this assessment, we undertook an action plan to strengthen internal controls and procedures. 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2016,
we completed remediation of two material weaknesses identified in the Company s 10-K for 2015 related to (1) insufficient
segregation of duties, oversight of work performed and lack of compensating controls in the Company s finance and accounting
functions due to limited personnel and (2) the lack of an effective anti-fraud program designed to detect and prevent fraud relating
to (i) an effective whistle-blower program or other comparable mechanism and (ii) an ongoing program to manage identified fraud
risks. 

During the quarter ended September 30,
2016, we thoroughly revised and upgraded our documentation of internal controls over financial reporting and continued testing
key controls for operating effectiveness. 

During the quarter ended September 30,
2016, we completed remediation of two additional material weaknesses identified in the Company s 10-K for 2015 related to
(1) documentation to support occurrences of review and approval procedures and (2) maintenance of an adequate risk oversight function
to evaluate and report on risks to financial reporting throughout the organization, including completion of a comprehensive risk
assessment to identify all potential risk areas and evaluate the adequacy of controls to mitigate identified risk. 

We have made substantial progress on remediation
of the three remaining material weaknesses identified in the Company s 10-K for 2015: 

We have further segregated duties within our finance and accounting functions, to ensure that incompatible duties are segregated.   

We have implemented a new process to more fully document the Company s identification of related parties and related party transactions, to ensure that all material transactions and developments impacting the financial statements are reflected and properly recorded.   

We have implemented a new process to more fully document the Company s accounting operations throughout the organization, including the review, supervision and monitoring taking place.   

We have expanded the personnel resources allocated to our Company s work, and the activities performed for our Company, by the two external firms.   

We have recruited additional personnel, and we are in the process of recruiting further personnel, to enable still further segregation of duties and increased oversight.   

We plan to continue taking steps to improve
our internal control system and to address the remaining deficiencies, but the timing of such steps is uncertain and our ability
to retain or attract qualified individuals to undertake these functions is also uncertain.  Other than the changes described
above, there has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably expected to materially affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting. 

Part II - Other Information  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

Derivative and Class Action Litigation  

In 2014, as previously reported, the Company
received demand letters from three purported individual shareholders seeking to inspect our corporate books and records pursuant
to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The demand letters were all substantially similar, and claimed that their
purpose is to investigate possible mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duty by the Company s directors and officers. 
They requested a range of documents.  On November 13, 2014, one of the purported shareholders filed a complaint in the Delaware
Court of Chancery seeking to enforce her books and records demand. The Company reached negotiated agreements and provided limited
records, under confidentiality agreements. On July 16, 2015, the parties filed, and the court entered, a stipulation dismissing
the case. 

On June 19, 2015, two of the purported
shareholders filed a complaint purportedly suing on behalf of a class of similarly situated shareholders and derivatively on behalf
of the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The lawsuit names Cognate BioServices, Inc., Toucan Partners, Toucan Capital
Fund III, our CEO Linda Powers and the Company's Board of Directors as defendants, and names the Company as a  nominal defendant 
with respect to the derivative claims. The complaint generally objects to certain transactions between the Company and Cognate
and the Toucan entities, in which Cognate and the Toucan entities provided services and financing to the Company, or agreed to
conversion of debts owed to them by the Company into equity. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary relief for the Company and
the plaintiffs, and various forms of equitable relief, including disgorgement of allegedly improper benefits, rescission of the
challenged transactions, and an order forbidding similar transactions in the future. On September 1, 2015, the Company and other
named defendants filed motions to dismiss. In response, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 6, 2015. The Company
and the other named defendants filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs' amended complaint on January 19, 2016. The plaintiffs filed
an answering brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss on April 4, 2016. The Company and the other defendants filed reply briefs
on May 18, 2016. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend the case

On November 19, 2015, a third purported
shareholder who had sought corporate books and records filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland,
claiming to sue derivatively on behalf of the Company. The complaint names the Company's Board of Directors, Toucan Capital Fund
III, L.P., Toucan General II, LLC, Toucan Partners, LLC, and Cognate as defendants, and names the Company as a nominal defendant.
The complaint claims that the plaintiff made a demand on the Company's Board of Directors to commence an action against the Company's
directors and its CEO and that the plaintiff commenced the derivative action after not receiving a response to the demand letter
within an allegedly  sufficient time.  The complaint further claims that the Company purportedly overcompensated Cognate
and Toucan for certain services and loans in payments of stock, and that the Company's CEO, Ms. Powers, benefited from these transactions
with Cognate and Toucan, which she allegedly owns or controls. The complaint asserts that the alleged overpayments unjustly enriched
Ms. Powers, Toucan, and Cognate. The Complaint also claims that the Company's directors breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty
and good faith to the Company by authorizing the payments to Cognate. Finally, the complaint claims that Ms. Powers, Cognate, and
Toucan aided and abetted the directors' breaches of fiduciary duties by causing the board to enter into the agreements with Cognate.
The plaintiff seeks an award of unspecified damages to the Company and seeks equitable remedies, including disgorgement by Ms.
Powers, Toucan, and Cognate of the allegedly improper benefits received as a result of the disputed transactions. The plaintiff
also seeks costs and disbursements associated with bringing suit, including attorneys' fees and expert fees. On February 2, 2016,
plaintiff and defendants filed a joint motion to stay the proceedings pending an investigation by a special committee of the Company's
Board of Directors into the allegations asserted in the demand letter and underlying the lawsuit. The court entered the stay on
March 18, 2016.  The Company intends to vigorously defend the case. 

Class Action Securities Litigation  

On August 26, 2015, a purported shareholder
of the Company filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  The lawsuit
names the Company and Ms. Powers as defendants.  On December 14, 2015, the court appointed two lead plaintiffs. The Lead Plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint on February 12, 2016, purportedly on behalf of all of those who purchased common stock in NW Bio between
January 13, 2014 and August 21, 2015. The amended complaint generally claims that the defendants violated Section 10(b) and Section
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making misleading statements and/or omissions on a variety of subjects, including
the status and results of the Company s DCVax trials.  The amended complaint seeks unspecified damages, attorneys 
fees, and costs. The Company and Ms. Powers filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs  amended complaint on April 12, 2016.  The
plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on June 13, 2016. The Company and Ms. Powers filed a reply in support of
their motion to dismiss on July 28, 2016. The Company intends to vigorously defend the case. 

Shareholder Books and Record Demand  

On December 7, 2015, the Company received
a letter on behalf of shareholders demanding to inspect certain corporate books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law. The demand letter claimed that its purpose was to investigate: (1) allegedly improper transactions, misconduct,
and mismanagement by directors and an officer of the Company; (2) the possible breach of fiduciary duty by certain directors and
officers of the Company; and (3) the independence and disinterestedness of the Company s board, to determine whether a pre-suit
demand would be necessary before commencing any derivative action on behalf of the Company. The Company has appointed a special
committee of its Board of Directors consisting of independent and disinterested directors to investigate the allegations set forth
in the demand letter, as well as the allegations asserted in the litigation summarized above. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Other than the following additional risk
factor, the risk factors described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings continue to apply as described
therein: 

If we fail to comply with Nasdaq listing rules, or remedy
non-compliance, we could be subject to adverse action by Nasdaq   

As the Company has reported, on June 24,
2016 the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Staff notifying the Company that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company s
common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the  Common Stock ) for the 30 consecutive business days preceding receipt
of such letter, the Common Stock had no longer met the requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share,
as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On November 7, 2016 the Company also received a letter from the Nasdaq Staff notifying
the Company that certain of the Company s financing transactions did not comply with Nasdaq rules. The Nasdaq Staff had determined
to aggregate a series of transactions that were completed with various unrelated parties between May 15, 2016 and October 13, 2016
for purposes of assessing whether the 20% threshold for shareholder approval had been triggered for issuances priced below the
applicable market price. These transactions included repricing of existing common stock purchase warrants and issuances of new
common shares and common stock purchase warrants. If we fail to comply with Nasdaq s continued listing standards, we could
be delisted and our common stock would then trade, if at all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as the OTCQB or OTCQX markets
or the Pink Current information tier.  In addition, delisting of our common stock could depress our stock price or limit
liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Further, delisting of our common stock would likely result in our common stock becoming a  penny stock  under the Securities
Exchange Act.
