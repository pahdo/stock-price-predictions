ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.  

Business Development 

Concierge
Technologies, Inc. ( Concierge  or sometimes the
 Company ), was incorporated in California on August
18, 1993 as "Fanfest, Inc." On August 29, 1995 its name was changed
to Starfest, Inc. ( Starfest ), and on March 20, 2002
its name was changed to  Concierge Technologies,
Inc.  

Pursuant
to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "MAS XX Purchase Agreement")
dated March 6, 2000 between MAS Capital, Inc., an Indiana
corporation, the controlling shareholder of MAS Acquisition XX
Corp. ("MAS XX"), an Indiana corporation, and Starfest,
approximately 96.83 percent (8,250,000 shares) of the outstanding
shares of common stock of MAS XX were exchanged for $100,000 and
150,000 shares of common stock of Starfest in a transaction in
which Starfest became the parent corporation of MAS
XX. 

At the time of this transaction, the market price
of Starfest's common stock was $1.50 bid at closing on March 7,
2000 on the OTC Bulletin Board ( OTCBB ). Accordingly,
the consideration Starfest paid for the 96.83 percent interest in
MAS XX was valued at $325,000.  Concierge, Inc., a Nevada
corporation, loaned Starfest the $100,000 cash portion of the
consideration evidenced by a no-interest, demand note. Michael
Huemmer, the president of Starfest, loaned to Starfest the 150,000
shares of common stock of Starfest that was the stock portion of
the consideration. 

Upon
execution of the MAS XX Purchase Agreement and the subsequent
delivery of $100,000 cash and 150,000 shares of Starfest common
stock on March 7, 2000, to MAS Capital Inc., pursuant to Rule
12g-3(a) of the General Rules and Regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  Commission ), Starfest became
the successor issuer to MAS XX for reporting purposes under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Act ) and
elected to report under the Act effective March 7,
2000. 

MAS
XX had no business, no assets, and no liabilities at the time of
the transaction. Starfest entered into the transaction solely for
the purpose of becoming the successor issuer to MAS XX for
reporting purposes under the 1934 Exchange Act. Prior to this
transaction, Starfest was preparing to register its common stock
with the Commission in order to avoid being delisted by the OTCBB.
By engaging in the Rule 12g-3(a) transaction, Starfest avoided the
possibility that its planned registration statement with the
Commission would not be fully reviewed by the Commission's staff
before an April 2000 deadline, which would result in Starfest's
common stock being delisted on the OTCBB. 

An
agreement of merger was entered into between Starfest and
Concierge, Inc., a Nevada corporation, on January 26, 2000. The
proposed merger was submitted to the shareholders of each of
Starfest and Concierge, Inc., pursuant to a Form S-4
Prospectus-Proxy Statement filed with the Commission. 

1 

As
described in Starfest s Form 8-K filed on April 2, 2002, with
the Commission (Commission File No. 000-29913), the shareholders of
Starfest and Concierge did approve the merger, and the merger was
legally effected on March 20, 2002. 

Pursuant
to the agreement of merger between Starfest and
Concierge, 

Starfest
was the surviving corporation, 

The
shareholders of Concierge received pro rata for their shares of
common stock of Concierge, 99,957,713 shares of common stock of
Starfest in the merger, and all shares of capital stock of
Concierge were cancelled, 

The
fiscal year-end of the corporation was changed to June
30, 

The
officers and directors of Concierge became the officers and
directors of Starfest, and 

The
name of Starfest was changed to "Concierge Technologies,
Inc." 

Our Business 

Concierge
conducts business primarily through its wholly-owned operating
subsidiaries. The operations of Concierge s wholly-owned
subsidiaries are more particularly described herein but are
summarized as follows: 

Kahnalytics,
Inc., a US based company, captures and presents data from
vehicle-mounted camera devices equipped for
live-streaming. 

Gourmet
Foods, Ltd., a New Zealand based company, manufactures and
distributes New Zealand meat pies on a commercial
scale. 

Brigadier
Security Systems, a Canadian based company, sells and installs
commercial and residential alarm monitoring systems. These
activities are conducted in the US, New Zealand and Canada
respectively. 

On
May 5, 2004 we acquired all of the outstanding and issued shares of
Planet Halo, a privately held Nevada corporation. 

On
June 5, 2007 Planet Halo launched its first wireless broadband
network designed for subscription access to the Internet. The
second such network was completed in Ventura, California during the
2007-2008 fiscal year. Planet Halo continued to operate and expand
the subscriber base until encountering insurmountable competition
from disruptive technologies. The wireless business was
discontinued during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, and a
transition was made to research and development activities for
in-vehicle video recording devices. In January 2013 we sold all of
our interest in Planet Halo through a stock redemption agreement
wherein a holder of Concierge Series B, Voting, Convertible
Preferred stock exchanged a portion of those shares for all of the
issued and outstanding stock in Planet Halo. 

2 

On January 23, 2008 we acquired all of the
outstanding and issued shares of Wireless Village, a privately held
Nevada corporation based in Cleveland, Ohio. Wireless
Village s assets included computer hardware, software, domain
names, existing radio site infrastructure, and expertise in
designing, operating, managing and maintaining wireless and wired
networks, including video security systems. Wireless Village began
transitioning to the business of mobile incident reporting, or
 black box  technology, for vehicles during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2010. During September 2010 Wireless Village
offered three knowledgeable individuals, a product manufacturer,
and an industry lobbyist an equity stake in the company in exchange
for providing their services and expertise, along with a potential
client list, exclusively to Wireless Village. Accordingly, on
October 8, 2010, we conveyed approximately 49% of Concierge s
equity in Wireless Village, in the aggregate, to the aforementioned
group. As a result the focus of Wireless Village was redirected to
the business of mobile incident reporting technology and sales. A
fictitious business name of 3  rd 
 Eye Cam was adopted and filed in the
State of Nevada and, subsequent to a trade mark dispute settlement,
that name was discontinued in favor of the fictitious name Janus
Cam. The company then operated from leased offices in South San
Francisco, CA.  

During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, Concierge, through a stock
exchange agreement, acquired all of the shares owned by the
minority shareholders of Wireless Village in exchange for shares of
Concierge Series B, Voting, Convertible Preferred stock. As of June
30, 2014, Wireless Village was a wholly owned subsidiary of
Concierge and its only operating subsidiary. 

During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we entered into a Stock
Redemption Agreement (the  SRA ) wherein we agreed to
sell all of the issued and outstanding shares in Wireless Village
to the executive management team of Wireless Village in exchange
for the redemption of 68,000,000 shares of Concierge s common
stock held by the buyers plus a forgiveness of intercompany debt
totaling $344,052 owed to us by Wireless Village. As a further
condition of the SRA a certain segment of the Wireless Village
business was to be retained by Concierge through a non-exclusive
distribution agreement. The transaction closed on May 7,
2015. 

On
May 26, 2015, a new wholly-owned subsidiary named Kahnalytics, Inc.
( Kahnalytics ), was established in the State of
California for the purpose of taking on the segment of the business
retained in the spinoff of Janus Cam and to direct resources
towards the further development of data processing capabilities
intended for risk management used by vehicle insurance
companies. 

On
August 11, 2015, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding
stock in Gourmet Foods, Ltd., a New Zealand corporation
( Gourmet Foods ) located in Tauranga, who is a
commercial-scale manufacturer of New Zealand meat pies under the
brand names  Ponsonby Pies  and  Pat s
Pantry . Gourmet Foods distributes its products through major
grocery store chains, convenience stores, small restaurants and
gasoline station markets. The purchase price of $1,753,428 was paid
in cash. 

On
June 2, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock
in Brigadier Security Systems, a Canadian corporation
( Brigadier ) located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
Brigadier sells and installs alarm monitoring and security systems
to commercial and residential customers under brand names
 Brigadier Security Systems  and  Elite
Security  throughout the province of Saskatchewan with
offices in Saskatoon and Regina. The all-cash purchase price was
$1,540,830. 

3 

Competition. 
 Our potential competitors include
larger, better financed companies that offer products similar to
ours. In particular, our foreign subsidiaries face stiff
competition with respect to their product and service offerings.
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial,
technical, and human resources than we do, as well as greater
experience in the discovery and development of products and the
commercialization of those products. Our competitors 
products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and
sold, than any products we may commercialize and may render our
products obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the
expenses of their commercialization. Our larger competitors also
enjoy a much wider and entrenched market share making it
particularly difficult for us to penetrate certain market segments
and even if penetrated, might make it difficult to maintain. We
anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as
new products and new competitors enter the market. However, with
respect to the market share we currently enjoy, we believe that our
core customers will remain loyal. We will continue to strive to
capture additional customers through organic growth and a focus on
quality.     

Governmental Approval of
Principal Products  . 
No governmental approval is required in the U.S. for Concierge's
products. 

Government
Regulations  .  There
are no governmental regulations in the U.S. that apply to
Concierge's sale of subscriptions to its Kahnalytics live-streaming
data services, and no specific license or approvals are required,
with the exception of adoption by local industry associations or
municipalities on a case-by-case basis of the devices meeting
suitability for purpose standards. 

Dependence on Major
Customers and Suppliers  .  Concierge, through Kahnalytics as a
licensed user of a proprietary software application, is dependent
on the continued support of this online platform and the adherence
to the license contract terms between Kahnalytics and the
foreign-based licensor. Kahnalytics is also largely dependent on
its single-source sales channel to continue to expand its dealer
network of resellers who, in turn, activate subscribers to the
Kahnalytics service. Hardware sold by Kahnalytics is currently
supplied by one source, however in the event this source proves to
be inadequate there are other alternative sources of equal or
comparable devices as needed by Kahnalytics. During the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2015 Kahnalytics had just one customer accounting
for 100% of its sales. Correspondingly, Kahnalytics had only two
suppliers of the hardware it sold with the larger of the suppliers
accounting for 92% of the cost of goods sold for fiscal year ended
June 30, 2015. Sales of these products were discontinued during the
current fiscal year. 

Concierge, through
Brigadier Security Systems, is dependent upon its contractual
relationship with the alarm monitoring company who purchases the
monitoring contracts and provides monitoring services to
Brigadier s customers. In the event this contract is
terminated Brigadier would be compelled to find an alternate source
of alarm monitoring, or establish such a facility itself.
Management believes that the contractual relationship is
sustainable, and has been for many years, with alternate solutions
available should the need arise. Sales to the two largest customers
totaled 55% of the total revenues for the one-month period ended
June 30, 2016, and accounted for approximately 38.6% of accounts
receivable as of the balance sheet date of June 30,
2016. 

4 

Concierge, through
Gourmet Foods, has three major customer groups comprising the gross
revenues to Gourmet Foods; 1) grocery, 2) gasoline convenience
stores, 3) independent retailers. The grocery and food industry is
dominated by several large chain operations, which are customers of
Gourmet Foods, and there are no long term guarantees that these
major customers will continue to purchase products from Gourmet
Foods, however the relationships have been in place for sufficient
time to give management reasonable confidence in their continuing
business. For the 11-month period ending and balance sheet date of
June 30, 2016, our largest customer in the grocery industry, who
operates through a number independently branded stores, accounted
for approximately 14% of our gross sales revenues and 34% of our
accounts receivable. The second largest in the grocery industry
accounted for approximately 10% of our gross revenues and 12% of
our accounts receivable. In the gasoline convenience store market
we supply two major accounts. The largest is a marketing consortium
of gasoline dealers accounting for approximately 44% of our gross
sales revenues and 24% of our accounts receivable. The second
largest are independent operators accounting for approximately 13%
of gross sales and 17% of accounts receivable. The third category
of independent retailers accounted for the balance of our gross
sales revenue however the group is fragmented and no one customer
accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. Gourmet Foods
is not dependent upon any one major supplier as many alternative
sources are available in the local market place should the need
arise. 

Seasonality  . 
There should be no seasonal aspect to Concierge s
business. 

Research and
Development  . 
Concierge expended no significant amount of money on research and
development during fiscal year ending June 30, 2016. 

Environmental
Controls  .  Concierge
is subject to no environmental controls or restrictions that
require the outlay of capital or the obtaining of a permit in order
to engage in business in the US. In New Zealand, Gourmet Foods is
subject to local regulations as are usual and customary for those
in the food processing, manufacturing and distribution
business. 

Patents, Trademarks,
Copyrights and Intellectual Property  .  Concierge has trademarked its Personal
Communications Attendant. It has no patents on the product. Gourmet
Foods, Ponsonby Pies and Pat s Pantry are all registered
trademarks of Gourmet Foods, Ltd. 

Number of
Employees  .   On June 30, 2016, we employed no persons full time
and relied solely on independent sales personnel, commissioned
agents, contracted service providers and consultants to perform
additional support and administrative functions in the US. Gourmet
Foods employs approximately 45 persons in New Zealand and Brigadier
employs approximately 19 persons in Canada.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES.  

We
own no plants or real property. 

Facilities 

Our
administration offices are housed by our Chief Financial Officer,
David Neibert, whose mailing address is 29115 Valley Center Rd.,
K-206, Valley Center, CA 92082. The Company pays no rent and has no
lease obligations. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Brigadier, rents
facilities in Saskatoon and Regina, Canada. Our wholly-owned
subsidiary, Gourmet Foods, rents facilities in Tauranga, New
Zealand. We believe that the facilities described herein are
adequate for our current and immediately foreseeable operating
needs.  

ITEM 3.   LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.  

On
May 6, 2002, a default judgment was awarded to Brookside
Investments Ltd. ( Brookside ) against, jointly and
severally, our company, Allen E. Kahn, and The Whitehall Companies
in the amount of $135,000 plus interest and legal fees. Concierge
did not defend against the complaint by Brookside, which alleged
that Brookside was entitled to a refund of its investment as a
result of a breach of contract. Brookside had entered into a
subscription agreement with Concierge, Inc. that called for, among
other things, the pending merger between Starfest and Concierge,
Inc. to be completed within 180 days of the investment. The merger
was not completed within 180 days and Brookside sought a refund of
its investment, which Concierge was unable to provide. 

As of   May 6,
2012, the judgment had lapsed and there is no further effect.
Although the judgment is no longer enforceable against Concierge,
and Concierge is no longer domiciled in the state of jurisdiction
where the judgment was entered, the amount of $135,000 continues to
be listed among the accrued expenses of the
company.

had no retained earnings and have declared no dividends on our
capital stock. Under Nevada law, a company - such as our company -
can pay dividends only 

from retained
earnings, or 

if after the
dividend is made, 

its tangible assets
would equal at least 11/4 times its liabilities, and 

its current assets
would at least equal its current liabilities,  or  

if the average of
its earnings before income taxes and before interest expenses for
the last two years was less than the average of its interest
expenses for the last two years, then its current assets must be
equal to at least 11/4 times its current liabilities. 

Our
strategy on dividends is to declare and pay dividends only from
retained earnings and only when our Board of Directors deems it
prudent and in the best interests of the company to declare and pay
dividends. 

Penny Stock Regulations 

Our
common stock trades on the OTC Markets QB Exchange at a price less
than $5 a share and therefore is subject to the rules governing
"penny stocks." 

A
"penny stock" is any stock that: 

sells
for less than $5 a share. 

is
not listed on an exchange or authorized for quotation on The Nasdaq
Stock Market, and 

is
not a stock of a "substantial issuer." We currently have net
tangible assets of at least $2 million which would qualify us as a
 substantial issuer . 

7 

There
are statutes and regulations of the Commission that impose a strict
regimen on brokers that recommend penny stocks. 

The Penny Stock Suitability Rule 

Before
a broker-dealer can recommend and sell a penny stock to a new
customer who is not an institutional accredited investor, the
broker-dealer must obtain from the customer information concerning
the person's financial situation, investment experience and
investment objectives. Then, the broker-dealer must "reasonably
determine" (1) that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for
the person and (2) that the person, or his advisor, is capable of
evaluating the risks in penny stocks. 

After
making this determination, the broker-dealer must furnish the
customer with a written statement setting forth the basis for this
suitability determination. The customer must sign and date a copy
of the written statement and return it to the
broker-dealer. 

Finally
the broker-dealer must also obtain from the customer a written
agreement to purchase the penny stock, identifying the stock and
the number of shares to be purchased. 

The
above exercise delays a proposed transaction. It causes many
broker-dealer firms to adopt a policy of not allowing their
representatives to recommend penny stocks to their
customers. 

The
Penny Stock Suitability Rule, described above, and the Penny Stock
Disclosure Rule, described below, do not apply to the
following: 

transactions
not recommended by the broker-dealer, 

sales
to institutional accredited investors, 

transactions
in which the customer is a director, officer, general partner, or
direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 5 percent of any
class of equity security of the issuer of the penny stock that is
the subject of the transaction, and 

transactions
in penny stocks by broker-dealers whose income from penny stock
activities does not exceed five percent of their total income
during certain defined periods. 

The Penny Stock Disclosure Rule 

Another
Commission rule - the Penny Stock Disclosure Rule - requires a
broker-dealer, who recommends the sale of a penny stock to a
customer in a transaction not exempt from the suitability rule
described above, to furnish the customer with a "risk disclosure
document." This document is set forth in a federal regulation and
contains the following information: 

A
statement that penny stocks can be very risky, that investors often
cannot sell a penny stock back to the dealer that sold them the
stock, 

8 

A
warning that salespersons of penny stocks are not impartial
advisers but are paid to sell the stock, 

The
statement that federal law requires the salesperson to tell the
potential investor in a penny stock - 

the
"offer" and the "bid" on the stock, and 

the
compensation the salesperson and his firm will receive for the
trade, 

An
explanation that the offer price and the bid price are the
wholesale prices at which dealers are willing to sell and buy the
stock from other dealers, and that in its trade with a customer the
dealer may add a retail charge to these wholesale
prices, 

A
warning that a large spread between the bid and the offer price can
make the resale of the stock very costly, 

Telephone
numbers a person can call if he or she is a victim of
fraud, 

Admonitions
- 

to
use caution when investing in penny stocks, 

to
understand the risky nature of penny stocks, 

to
know the brokerage firm and the salespeople with whom one is
dealing, and 

to
be cautious if one s salesperson leaves the
firm. 

Finally,
the customer must be furnished with a monthly statement including
prescribed information relating to market and price information
concerning the penny stocks held in the customer's
account. 

Effects of the Rule 

The
above penny stock regulatory scheme is a response by the Congress
and the Commission to known abuses in the telemarketing of
low-priced securities by "boiler shop" operators. The scheme
imposes market impediments on the sale and trading of penny stocks.
It has a limiting effect on a stockholder's ability to resell a
penny stock. 

Our
shares likely will trade below $5 a share on the OTC Markets
exchange and be, for some time at least, shares of a "penny stock"
subject to the trading market impediments described
above. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Outstanding Stock
Options 

The
following sets forth certain information concerning securities
which were sold or issued by us without the registration of the
securities under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on
exemptions from such registration requirements within the past
three years: 

9 

On
February 19, 2014, we issued 53,571 unregistered shares of our
common stock to a holder of a note receivable from Janus Cam as a
fee in exchange for an agreement to extend the maturity date of the
note receivable. The transaction was recorded as an expense of $750
based on the market value of our stock as of the date of issue. We
have also issued shares of common stock in settlement of
convertible debentures as detailed in the following paragraphs. The
issued shares were unregistered and issued as per the
following: 

On
February 18, 2014, we entered into a series of agreements,
including a convertible debenture, that resulted in a funding of
$53,000. The note was convertible, at the option of the debenture
holder, to restricted common shares after August 18, 2014, at a
conversion price calculated on a prescribed discount to the
trailing 10-day volume weighted average market price
( VWAP ) of our shares on the date of conversion.
During the initial 6 months from the date of the note we may repay
the principal plus accrued interest at the rate of 8% per annum by
applying a pre-payment penalty determined on a sliding scale tied
to the aging of the note. After the initial 6-month period had
elapsed we could not repay the note until its maturity date on
November 18, 2014, at which time the note principal and interest
became due and payable without pre-payment penalty. We identified
embedded derivatives related to the convertible debenture. These
embedded derivatives included certain conversion features. The
accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires
that we record fair value of the derivatives as of the inception
date of the convertible debenture and fair value as of each
subsequent balance sheet date. During the quarter ended September
30, 2014, at the election of the debenture holder, we converted
$28,000 of the principal to equity through issuance of 4,346,247
shares of common stock. During the quarter ended December 31, 2014,
at the election of the debenture holder we converted $25,000 of the
principal plus $2,120 of accrued interest to equity through
issuance of 5,424,000 shares of common stock. The debenture was
paid in full as of October 10, 2015, and thus no derivative expense
or fair value of the embedded derivative was recorded for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. 

On
January 1, 2013, we consolidated all outstanding notes payable due
a related party into one loan agreement containing certain
conversion features whereby the note holder could convert the
principal amount of the loan, $204,700 comprised of the sum total
of the principal amounts of the individual notes, $122,000, plus
$82,700 in accrued interest applicable to those notes, together
with accrued interest on the principal at the rate of 4.944% per
annum, into shares of our common stock at the conversion rate of
$0.02 per share. The note is unsecured and became due and payable
on January 1, 2015. The accrued interest on this $204,700
convertible debenture as of December 31, 2014 was $20,241. There
was no beneficial conversion feature involved in the new note. On
December 19, 2014, we entered into an amendment to the debenture
that allowed for the maturity date to be extended to June 1, 2015,
and provided us with rights to settle the debenture in full, upon
completion of an equity investment in excess of $1,500,000, by
payment of $122,000 in cash and issuance of 8,270,000 shares of
common stock valued at $0.01 per share to the debenture holder. On
January 26, 2015, we exercised those rights and paid the debenture
in full. The transaction resulted in a gain on the issuance of
shares of $69,861 as the fair market value of a share of our common
stock at December 19, 2014, was $0.004. The gain resulted for a
related party, thus it was recorded in additional paid in capital
account. 

10 

We sold the following shares of our Series B
Convertible, Voting, Preferred Stock during the last three years
without registering the shares.  Each share of Series B
Convertible, Voting, Preferred Stock is convertible into 20 shares
of common stock and carries a vote equal to 20 shares of common
stock in all matters brought before the shareholders for
vote. 

We
issued the following shares of common stock pursuant to certain
conversion rights contained in our preferred stock. The shares of
preferred stock issued in the conversion were cancelled resulting
in no net effect to the number of voting shares
outstanding. 

All
of the above unregistered sales were made pursuant to the exemption
from registration provided by the Commission s Regulation D,
Rule 506. All purchasers were either accredited investors or, if
not, were provided copies of our recent filings with the Commission
including financial statements meeting the requirements of the
Commission s Item 310 of Regulation S-B. All purchasers were
provided the opportunity to ask questions of our
management. 

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. 

Some of the information contained in this Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and elsewhere in this report includes forward-looking
statements based on our current management s expectations.
There can be no assurance that actual results, outcomes or business
conditions will not differ materially from those projected or
suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various
factors, including, among others, our limited operating history,
unpredictability of future operating results, competitive pressures
and the other potential risks and uncertainties.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto
and is qualified in its entirety by the foregoing and by more
detailed financial information appearing elsewhere. See "Financial
Statements." 

The
Company, through Planet Halo and Wireless Village, had been selling
subscriptions to its wireless Internet access service in various
increments, including daily, weekly, monthly and yearly since 2007.
During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, we completed the
transition away from this business and refocused our efforts,
through our majority owned subsidiary Wireless Village dba/Janus
Cam, on the sale and distribution of mobile video surveillance
systems, generically known as  drive cams . During the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, we sold Planet Halo to a
shareholder through a stock redemption agreement and we acquired
all of the minority owned shares of Wireless Village through a
stock-for-stock exchange. Having Wireless Village as a wholly-owned
subsidiary for 2 years produced operating losses and we elected to
raise additional working capital through equity as well as change
our strategic focus. Accordingly, during the fiscal year ended June
30, 2015, we raised $3 million in cash, sold Wireless Village to
its executive management team through a stock redemption agreement,
established Kahnalytics as our wholly-owned subsidiary in order to
carry on certain profitable aspects of the former Wireless Village
line of business, acquired Gourmet Foods, and acquired Brigadier.
The acquisition of Gourmet Foods was completed on August 11, 2015,
and the acquisition of Brigadier on June 2, 2016, both consummated
as cash transactions. As of June 30, 2016, our financial statements
are representative of the operating results of these three
wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

Kahnalytics 

On
May 26, 2015, we established a new wholly-owned subsidiary
domiciled in the state of California and named Kahnalytics, Inc.
( Kahnalytics ). Kahnalytics took over the business of
selling cameras, installation and support services to the insurance
industry, a business segment formerly addressed by Janus Cam, but
then retained by Concierge as part of the Stock Redemption
Agreement. 

During
the period July 1, 2015, through October 1, 2015, Kahnalytics
purchased cameras, various other hardware items, and installation
services for sale to specific insurance companies, and ultimately
for installation into insured s vehicles. The hardware items
are either listed in inventory if held beyond the close of the
current accounting period, or summarized as  cost of goods
sold  when sold. Inventory orders which have been paid for,
or partially paid for, in advance of receipt are classified as
 Advance to Suppliers.  Generally, hardware is sold to
customers who require delivery and installation of the product in
their vehicles. The charges for services such as these are included
in the bundled, installed, sales price reflected on sales invoices
and accounts receivable. The revenues for Kahnalytics for the years
ended June 30, 2016, for camera and related sales were $120,430 as
compared to the year ending June 30, 2015, where sales were
$95,057. During October 2015 Kahnalytics moved away from the camera
sales segment and refocused its business towards the capture of
live-steaming data from vehicle camera devices. As a result, the
remaining inventory of cameras and SD cards were deemed
discontinued products and their combined value (being lower of cost
or market) was impaired by $48,330. 

12 

By
obtaining an exclusive software license and partnering with a
camera importer/distributor as a channel-to-market, Kahnalytics
began the business of hosting a web-based server that subscribers
could access to view their camera video files, vehicle location,
speed and event triggers in real time. The system was ready to
launch by June 2016. To facilitate the sales process and entice
customers to the online subscription service, Kahnalytics
implemented a hardware subsidy program and offered a wireless data
plan that was resold to subscribers of the service, called the
Kahnalytics Fleet Management Service or  FMS . Two
types of services were offered, 1) a FMS basic subscription plan
where subscribers provided their own wireless connection to the FMS
and 2) a FMS data plan where subscribers were provided hardware
needed to connect wirelessly to the Internet and also charged a
monthly fee for the air time usage. Kahnalytics also charged a
subsidized price of $50 per each wireless hardware device used in
creating the wireless connection. For the year ended June 30, 2016,
the total revenues from FMS related hardware sales was $2,250.
Kahnalytics purchases data plans from a network reseller and, in
turn, resells that plan to its subscribers. For the year ended June
30, 2016, sales of FMS basic subscriptions were $480 and FMS data
plans were $0. There were no FMS related subscription or hardware
sales for the year ended June 30, 2015. Hardware sales of cameras
and SD cards for the year ended June 30, 2016, were $117,700 as
compared to $95,057 for the year ended June 30, 2015. Other income
for the year ended June 30, 2016, was $81 and comprised of
adjustments to sales tax liability as compared to $0 for the year
ended June 30, 2015. Accounts receivable as of June 30, 2016, were
$2,640 as compared to $95,417 as of June 30, 2015. The difference
is attributed to the discontinuation of most hardware sales during
the current fiscal year and the focus on subscription services
instead, which results in less gross revenues overall rather than
any significant change in the aging of accounts receivable. Net
loss after the impairment of inventory of $48,330 and provision for
income tax of $800 was $60,612 as compared to a net loss for the
year ended June 30, 2015 of $10,332. 

Gourmet Foods 

Gourmet
Foods Limited ( Gourmet Foods ), was organized in its
current form in 2005 (previously known as Pats Pantry Ltd.
( Pats Pantry )). Pats Pantry was founded in 1966 to
produce and sell wholesale bakery products, meat pies and
patisserie cakes and slices, in New Zealand. Gourmet Foods, located
in Tauranga, New Zealand, sells substantially all of its goods to
supermarkets and service station chains with stores located
throughout New Zealand. Gourmet Foods also has a large number of
smaller independent lunch bars, cafes and corner dairies among the
customer list, however they comprise a relatively insignificant
dollar volume in comparison to the primary accounts of large
distributors and retailers. We purchased all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Gourmet Foods effective as of August 1, 2015,
even though the transaction did not officially close until August
11, 2015. 

An
independent evaluation of the assets of Gourmet Foods was
commissioned as was an audit of their last two fiscal years ended
March 31st. It was ascertained that Gourmet Foods had experienced a
net loss over the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, of $9,558.
Contributing to the loss were several factors that current
management does not expect to reoccur which included an effort to
export product to Korea and an ill-suited sales effort involving
the addition of field sales representatives and their associated
expenses including company provided vehicles. Since the acquisition
date of August 11, 2015, Gourmet Foods has initiated several
strategies designed to improve profitability through a more
efficient and automated production process and sales growth
initiatives that involve an outreach to areas currently underserved
by Gourmet Foods. To assist with the purchase of new machinery and
cover interim working capital needs, we extended an interest-free
intercompany loan of NZ$250,000 translated to US$158,948 as of the
date of transfer. 

13 

The
accompanying financial statements include the operations of Gourmet
Foods for the period August 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016. Because
we did not acquire Gourmet Foods until the current fiscal year
there is no comparison data supplied in the accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations for Gourmet Foods for the
periods ended June 30, 2015, nor are the assets and liabilities of
Gourmet Foods included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets
as of June 30, 2015. 

Gourmet
Foods operates exclusively in New Zealand and thus the New Zealand
dollar is its functional currency. In order to consolidate our
reporting currency, the US dollar, with that of Gourmet Foods we
record foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction
gains and losses in accordance with SFAS 52, Foreign Currency
Translation. The translation of New Zealand currency into U.S.
dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using the exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and
expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the
period. Gains and losses resulting from the foreign currency
translations are included in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
found on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income and are listed as a gain of $103,736 for the
year ended June 30, 2016. 

Net
revenues for the eleven-month period August 1, 2015, through June
30, 2016 were $3,756,402. Cost of goods sold for the eleven-month
period ending June 30, 2016, was $2,500,075 resulting in a gross
profit of $1,256,327 or approximately 33% gross margin. General and
administrative expenses for the eleven-month period were $967,180
resulting in a net income before other income and expenses and
income tax of $289,147. The depreciation expense for Gourmet Foods
over the eleven-month period ending June 30, 2016, was $225,810.
The income tax provision of $80,892, the interest income of $3,842
and other income of $2,370 resulted in a net income of $214,467.
Accounts receivable as of June 30, 2016 were $285,673. 

Brigadier Security Systems 

Brigadier Security
Systems ( Brigadier ) was founded in 1985 and through
internal growth and acquisitions the core business of Brigadier
began in 1998. Today Brigadier is one of the largest SecurTek
dealers in Saskatchewan with offices in both major urban areas of
Regina (under the fictitious business name of  Elite
Security ) and Saskatoon. Brigadier is also a Honeywell
Certified Access Control Distributor, Kantech Global Dealer and UTC
Interlogix Security Pro dealer and the largest independent security
contractor in the province. Brigadier provides comprehensive
security solutions including access control, camera monitoring,
motion detection, and intrusion alarms to home and business owners
as well as government offices, schools and public buildings.
Brigadier typically sells hardware to customers and a full time
monitoring of the premises. The contract for monitoring the premise
is then conveyed to a third party telecom in exchange for an
upfront payment and recurring residuals based on subscriber
contracts. 

14 

The
accompanying financial statements include the operations of
Brigadier for the period June 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016.
Because we did not acquire Brigadier until the current fiscal year
there is no comparison data supplied in the accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations for Brigadier for the periods
ended June 30, 2015, nor are the assets and liabilities of
Brigadier included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as
of June 30, 2015. 

Brigadier
operates exclusively in Canada and thus the Canadian dollar is its
functional currency. In order to consolidate our reporting
currency, the US dollar, with that of Brigadier we record foreign
currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses
in accordance with SFAS 52, Foreign Currency Translation. The
translation of Canadian currency into U.S. dollars is performed for
balance sheet accounts using the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a
weighted average exchange rate during the period. Gains and losses
resulting from the foreign currency translations are included in
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) found on the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and
are listed as a gain of $5,098 for the year ended June 30,
2016. 

Brigadier
purchases various component parts and accessories anticipated to be
required in near-term installations of systems pursuant to sales
forecasts. These parts are listed in inventory until sold, which is
determined by a sales contract, delivery of the product, and a
reasonable expectation of payment under typical terms of sale are
in evidence. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(determined on a FIFO basis) or market. Inventories include product
cost, inbound freight and warehousing costs. We compare the cost of
inventories with the market value and an allowance is made for
writing down the inventories to their market value, if lower. As of
June 30, 2016, an allowance for obsolete inventory value in the
amount of $14,282 was recorded in general and administrative
expense. 

The net sales for the one-month period ending June
30, 2016, were $348,553 with cost of goods sold recorded as
$124,931 resulting in a gross profit of $223,622 and gross margin
of 64%. General and administrative expenses for the one-month
period were $179,959 providing net operating income before income
tax provision and interest expense of $43,663, or 13%. The
depreciation expense for  Brigadier  for the one-month period was $560, income tax
provision at June 30, 2016, was $14,330, interest expense (net) was
$17 and allowance for obsolete inventory was $14,282 resulting in a
net profit of $29,316. Accounts receivable at June 30, 2016, were
$550,907.  

Concierge
Technologies 

The
primary expenses of Concierge are comprised of professional fees
paid to auditors, transaction costs incurred for fund raising and
acquisitions, accrued interest on borrowed funds and consulting
fees paid to our advisors. For the year ended June 30, 2016,
Concierge had no commercial operations apart from those of its
subsidiaries. Revenues from operations during the year ended June
30, 2016, were zero as compared to $160,094 for the year ended June
30, 2015. Overall, consolidated net revenues for the year ending
June 30, 2016, were $4,225,385 and $223,565 for the year ended June
30, 2015. Cost of revenues for the year ending June 30, 2016, and
2015 were $2,746,132 and $188,325 respectively, representing a
gross profit percentage of approximately 35% for the year ended
June 30, 2016, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015 of 15%.
Operating costs include general and administrative expense of
$1,411,047 and inventory impairment of $48,330 resulting in an
operating income of $19,876 for the year ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to a loss of $131,690 for the year ended June 30,
2015 

15 

We
realized a net income before provision of income taxes, after other
income $2,880 and interest expense of $8,686, and comprehensive
income for the year ended June 30, 2016, of $14,070 as compared to
a net loss before taxes of $204,216 for the year ended June 30,
2015. We attribute the increased income to the inclusion of
acquired subsidiaries Brigadier and Gourmet Foods as well as
disposal of non-revenue producing subsidiaries present during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The net loss after income tax
provision of $96,022 on a consolidated basis for the year ended
June 30, 2016 was $81,952 as compared to an income of $14,191 for
the year ended June 30, 2015. 

Comprehensive Loss,
after giving consideration to foreign currency translation losses
for the year ended June 30, 2016, was $111,455 as compared to
income of $14,191 for the year ending June 30, 2015, where no
foreign currency translation was required. 

Plan
of Operation for the Next Twelve Months 

Our
plan of operation for the next twelve months is to expand the
development of Kahnalytics through implementation of software
development and addition of new products, including a branding and
promotion of a recurring revenue product offering. Additionally, we
are expecting moderate growth in Brigadier through focused
management initiatives and consolidation within the security
industry. Similarly, we expect Gourmet Foods to be operating more
efficiently under current management and continue to increase
market share through additional product offerings and channels to
market. Our mission is to continue with our acquisition strategy by
identifying and acquiring profitable, mature, companies of a
diverse nature and with in-place management to produce increasing
revenue streams. By these initiatives we hope to: 

continue
to gain market share for our wholly-owned subsidiaries  areas
of operation, 

increase
our gross revenues and realize net operating profits, 

lower
our operating costs by unburdening certain selling expenses to
third party distributors, 

source
and retain staff experienced in the field of software development
and application of database report writing functions, 

have
sufficient cash reserves to pay down accrued expenses, 

complete
business combinations where we have a common control interest among
shareholders,

parties who have an interest in selling their privately held
companies to us, and

efficiencies in accounting and reporting through consolidated
operations of our subsidiaries from a management
perspective. 

Liquidity 

During
the current fiscal year we have invested approximately $3.5 million
in cash towards purchasing and assimilating Gourmet Foods and
Brigadier into our group of companies. We have continued to pursue
business opportunities with Kahnalytics and intend to grow that
opportunity by implementation of a software development project in
the coming months that is envisioned to produce a significant
recurring revenue stream when finalized. We forecast Gourmet Foods
and Brigadier to continue to produce a profit during the coming
fiscal year and the realization of those profits by Concierge may
be augmented by a resurgence of the New Zealand and Canadian
currencies against the U.S. dollar during the coming fiscal year.
While we intend to maintain and improve our revenue stream from
wholly owned subsidiaries Kahnalytics, Brigadier and Gourmet Foods,
we are also looking to expand our business to include other
synergistic partners and pursue possible licensing agreements for
product distribution on a global scale. Provided our subsidiaries
continue to operate as they are presently, and are projected to
operate, we have sufficient capital to pay our general and
administrative expenses for the coming fiscal year and to
adequately pursue our long term business objectives. 

We
believe that, through execution of our current business plan, we
will be able to continue to pay our financial obligations and to
avoid increases in its accrued liabilities in the coming fiscal
year. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As of
October 3, 2016, we have not entered into any transaction,
agreement or other contractual arrangement with an entity
unconsolidated with us under which we have: 

an obligation under
a guarantee contract, 

a retained or
contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated
entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or
market risk support to such entity for such assets, 

an obligation,
including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable
interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material
to, us where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk
or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging, or
research and development services with, us.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the
Board of Directors 

Concierge
Technologies, Inc. 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Concierge Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company")
as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders  equity, and cash
flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2016.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the
financial statements of Brigadier Security Systems (2000) Limited,
a wholly-owned subsidiary, which statements reflect total assets of
20% of consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2016 and total
revenues of 8% of consolidated total revenues for the one year
period ended June 30, 2016. Those statements were audited by
another auditor, whose report has been furnished to us, and our
opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for
Brigadier Security Systems (2000) Limited, is based solely on the
report of the other auditor. 

We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the
other auditor provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

In
our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other
auditor, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Concierge Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of June 30,
2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2016 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. 

The
Company's financial statements are prepared using the generally
accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of
liabilities in the normal course of business.  The
Company has incurred accumulated losses of $6,430,722. These
factors along with those discussed in Note 4 to the financial
statements, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these
matters are also described in Note 4.  The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty

NOTE
1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Concierge
Technologies, Inc., (the  Company ), a Nevada
corporation, was originally incorporated in California on August
18, 1993 as Fanfest, Inc. On March 20, 2002, the Company changed
its name to Concierge Technologies, Inc. The Company s
principal operations include the purchase and sale of digital
equipment through its wholly owned subsidiaries  Wireless Village doing
business as Janus Cam (until its disposal as of May 7, 2015),
Gourmet Foods, a manufacturer and distributor of meat pies in New
Zealand, Brigadier Security Systems, a provider of security alarm
installation and monitoring located in Canada, and 
Kahnalytics, Inc. a California corporation providing vehicle-based
live streaming video and event recording to online
subscribers. 

NOTE
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Concierge Technologies, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
Kahnalytics, Gourmet Foods, Ltd., Brigadier Security Systems and
Wireless Village (discontinued on May 7, 2015). All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America which requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

For
purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash
equivalents include all highly liquid debt instruments with
original maturities of three months or less which are not securing
any corporate obligations. 

Concentrations
of Risk 

The
Company maintains cash balances at a financial institution
headquartered in San Diego, California. Accounts are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000 per depositor.
The Company s uninsured cash balance in the United States was
$33,026 at June 30, 2016. Cash balances in Canada are maintained at
a financial institution in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Each account is
insured up to CD$100,000 by Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation
(CDIC). The Company s uninsured cash balance in Canada was
CD$123,311 (approximately US$95,190) at June 30, 2016. 

Balances at
financial institutions within certain foreign countries, including
New Zealand where the Company maintains cash balances, are not
covered by insurance. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had
uninsured deposits related to cash deposits in uninsured accounts
maintained within foreign entities of approximately $568,427. The
Company has not experienced any losses in such
accounts.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Major
customers   suppliers 

Concierge, through
Kahnalytics as a licensed user of a proprietary software
application, is dependent on the continued support of this online
platform and the adherence to the license contract terms between
Kahnalytics and the foreign-based licensor. Kahnalytics is also
largely dependent on its single-source sales channel to continue to
expand its dealer network of resellers who, in turn, activate
subscribers to the Kahnalytics service. Hardware sold by
Kahnalytics is currently supplied by one source, however in the
event this source proves to be inadequate there are other
alternative sources of equal or comparable devices as needed by
Kahnalytics. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 Kahnalytics
had just one customer accounting for 100% of its sales.
Correspondingly, Kahnalytics had only two suppliers of the hardware
it sold with the larger of the suppliers accounting for 92% of the
cost of goods sold for fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Sales of
these products were discontinued during the current fiscal
year. 

Concierge, through
Brigadier Security Systems, is dependent upon its contractual
relationship with the alarm monitoring company who purchases the
monitoring contracts and provides monitoring services to
Brigadier s customers. In the event this contract is
terminated Brigadier would be compelled to find an alternate source
of alarm monitoring, or establish such a facility itself.
Management believes that the contractual relationship is
sustainable, and has been for many years, with alternate solutions
available should the need arise. Sales to the two largest customers
totaled 55% of the total revenues for the one-month period ended
June 30, 2016, and accounted for approximately 38.6% of accounts
receivable as of the balance sheet date of June 30,
2016. 

Concierge, through
Gourmet Foods, has three major customer groups comprising the gross
revenues to Gourmet Foods; 1) grocery, 2) gasoline convenience
stores, 3) independent retailers. The grocery and food industry is
dominated by several large chain operations, which are customers of
Gourmet Foods, and there are no long term guarantees that these
major customers will continue to purchase products from Gourmet
Foods, however the relationships have been in place for sufficient
time to give management reasonable confidence in their continuing
business. For the 11-month period ending and balance sheet date of
June 30, 2016, our largest customer in the grocery industry, who
operates through a number independently branded stores, accounted
for approximately 14% of our gross sales revenues and 34% of our
accounts receivable. The second largest in the grocery industry
accounted for approximately 10% of our gross revenues and 12% of
our accounts receivable. In the gasoline convenience store market
we supply two major accounts. The largest is a marketing consortium
of gasoline dealers accounting for approximately 44% of our gross
sales revenues and 24% of our accounts receivable. The second
largest are independent operators accounting for approximately 13%
of gross sales and 17% of accounts receivable. The third category
of independent retailers accounted for the balance of our gross
sales revenue however the group is fragmented and no one customer
accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. Gourmet Foods
is not dependent upon any one major supplier as many alternative
sources are available in the local market place should the need
arise.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Allowance
for Doubtful Debts 

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio. In
establishing the required allowance, management regularly reviews
the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes customer credit
worthiness, customer concentrations, current economic trends and
changes in customer payment patterns. Reserves are recorded
primarily on a specific identification basis. Account balances are
charged off against the allowance after all means of collection
have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered
remote. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had recorded
allowance for doubtful accounts of $3,600 and $Nil,
respectively. 

Inventory 

Inventories are
valued at the lower of cost (determined on a FIFO basis) or market.
Inventories include product cost, inbound freight and warehousing
costs. Management compares the cost of inventories with the market
value and an allowance is made for writing down the inventories to
their market value, if lower. During the year ended June 30, 2016,
the Company incurred an impairment loss of $48,330 due to valuing
inventory at market which was lower than cost. 

Property
and Equipment 

Property and
equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals
and improvements are capitalized. When property and equipment are
retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain
or loss is included in operations. Depreciation is computed using
various methods over an estimated useful life of the
asset.

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible assets
consist of brand names, domain names, recipes, non-compete
agreements and customer lists. Intangible assets with finite lives
are amortized over the estimated useful life and are evaluated for
impairment at least on an annual basis and whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not
be recoverable. The Company assesses recoverability by determining
whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through
the discounted expected future cash flows. If the future discounted
cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the
Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the
carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.

CONCIERGE
TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents
the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of
the net assets acquired in a purchase businesses combination.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. The goodwill
impairment test is a two-step test. Under the first step, thefair
value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value
including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds
its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value,
an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit
and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test.
Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of
the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the
implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of
goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the
reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation.
The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair
value of the reporting unit goodwill. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

The
Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted
cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the assets. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment
loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the fair value. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company's financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts
payable. 

The
three levels are defined as follows: 

Level
1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. 

Level
2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly
or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities. 

Level
3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities. 

As of
the balance sheet dates, the estimated fair values of the financial
instruments were not materially different from their carrying
values as presented on the balance sheet. This is primarily
attributed to the short maturities of these
instruments.

CONCIERGE
TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue
primarily consists of sale of gourmet meat pies and related bakery
confections in New Zealand,  security
alarm system installation and monitoring in  Canada and sale
of mobile video recording devices and gathering of live-streaming
video recording data displayed online to subscribers in the U.S.A.
Revenue is accounted for net of sales taxes, sales returns, trade
discounts. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the
delivery has occurred, no other significant obligations of the
Company exist, and collectability is probable. Product is
considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and
title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been
transferred. For most of the Company s product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is
shipped. 

Share-based
Compensation 

The
Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date
based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense
over the applicable vesting period of the stock award using the
straight-line method. 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry
forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax
assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for
deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items
will either expire before the Company is able to realize their
benefits or if future deductibility is uncertain. 

When
tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions
taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing
authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the
merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that
would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is
recognized in the financial statements in the period during which,
based on all available evidence, management believes it is more
likely than not that the position will be sustained upon
examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation
processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated
with other positions. Tax positions that meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the
largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely
of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing
authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax
positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above
is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the
balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties
that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
Applicable interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax
benefits are classified as additional income taxes in the
statements of operations. 

Advertising
Costs 

The
Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred. Advertising
costs for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were
negligible. 

Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Foreign Currency
Translation 

We
record foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction
gains and losses in accordance with SFAS 52, Foreign Currency
Translation. The accounts of Gourmet Foods, Ltd. use the New
Zealand dollar as the functional currency. The accounts of
Brigadier Security System use the Canadian dollar as the functional
currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange
rate on the balance sheet date, and operating results are
translated at the average exchange rate throughout the period.
Accumulated translation loss classified as an item of accumulated
other comprehensive loss in the stockholders  equity section
of the consolidated balance sheet was $29,503 as of June 30,
2016. 

Statement
of Cash Flows 

The
Company s cash flows from operations are calculated based
upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets
and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not
necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the
consolidated balance sheet. 

Segment
Reporting 

The
Company defines operating segments as components about which
separate financial information is available that is evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing performances. The Company
allocates its resources and assesses the performance of its sales
activities based on the geographic locations of its subsidiaries
(see Note 20). 

Business
Combinations 

We
allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible
assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired
based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value
of purchase consideration over the fair values of these
identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such
valuations require management to make significant estimates and
assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include,
but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired
users, acquired trade names from a market participant perspective,
useful lives and discount rates. Management s estimates of
fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable,
but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a
result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the
measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we
may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the
conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments
are recorded to earnings.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In May
2014, the ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in
accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and
will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The
standard s core principle is that a company will recognize
revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In
August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new
revenue standard by one year, which will make it effective for the
Company in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30,
2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the
impact of adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In June
2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-12,
Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting for
Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a
Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service
Period (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) (ASU
2014-12). The guidance applies to all reporting entities that grant
their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the
award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could
be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments
require that a performance target that affects vesting and
thatcould be achieved after the requisite service period be treated
as a performance condition. For all entities, the amendments in
this update are effective for annual periods and interim periods
within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
Earlier adoption is permitted. The effective date is the same for
both public business entities and all other entities. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-12 on the
Company s results of operations or financial
condition. 

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an
Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU
2014-15). The guidance in ASU 2014-15 sets forth management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about
an entity s ability to continue as a going concern as well as
required disclosures. ASU 2014-15 indicates that, when preparing
financial statements for interim and annual financial statements,
management should evaluate whether conditions or events, in the
aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability
to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the
financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This
evaluation should include consideration of conditions and events
that are either known or are reasonably knowable at the date the
financial statements are issued or are available to be issued, as
well as whether it is probable that management s plans to
address the substantial doubt will be implemented and, if so,
whether it is probable that the plans will alleviate the
substantial doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods
ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods and annual
periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of
this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In
January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2015-01, Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual items
(Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by
Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items (ASU 2015-01). The
amendment eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary
items. This guidance is effective for the Company in the first
quarter of fiscal 2017. Early adoption is permitted and allows the
Company to apply the amendment prospectively or retrospectively.
The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.

to respond to stakeholders  concerns about the current
accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities.
Stakeholders expressed concerns that GAAP might require a reporting
entity to consolidate another legal entity in situations in which
the reporting entity s contractual rights do not give it the

In
April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, (Subtopic
835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs. ASU No. 2015-03 provides guidance that will require
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability. ASU No. 2015-03 affects
disclosures related to debt issuance costs but does not affect
existing recognition and measurement guidance for these items. ASU
No. 2015-03 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods
within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The
adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact
on the Company s results of operations, financial position or

customer s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing
arrangement, which includes software as a service, platform as a
service, infrastructure as a service, and other similar hosting
arrangements. ASU No. 2015-05 is effective for annual periods, and

In
September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business
Combinations (Topic 805) Simplifying the Accounting for
Measurement-Period Adjustments.  ASU No. 2015-06
simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments
attributable to an acquisition. Under prior guidance, adjustments
to provisional amounts during the measurement period that arise due
to new information regarding acquisition date circumstances must be
made retrospectively with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
The amended guidance requires an acquirer to record adjustments to
provisional amounts made during the measurement period in the
period that the adjustment is determined. The adjustments should
reflect the impact on earnings of changes in depreciation,
amortization, or other income effects, if any, as if the accounting
hadbeen completed as of the acquisition date. Additionally, amounts
recorded in the current period that would have been reflected in
prior reporting periods if the adjustments had been recognized as
of the acquisition date must be disclosed either on the face of the
income statement or in the notes to financial statements. This
guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2015 and early application is
permitted. The impact of the guidance on our financial condition,
results of operations and financial statement disclosures will
depend on the level of acquisition activity performed by the
Company.

In
November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
Taxes  (ASU 2015-17), which changes how deferred taxes are
classified on the balance sheet and is effective for financial
statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 requires all
deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as
non-current. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have
a material impact on the Company s results of operations,
financial position or disclosures. 

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
(ASU 2016-01), which requires equity investments that are not
accounted for under the equity method of accounting to be measured
at fair value with changes recognized in net income and updates
certain presentation and disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-01 is
effective beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this
guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s results of operations, financial position or
disclosures. 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
 Leases,  which requires lessees to recognize
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, for all leases, with the
exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date of each
lease. This ASU requires lessees to apply a dual approach,
classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on
the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed
purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether
lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method
or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. This ASU is
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and
interim periods within those annual periods.Early adoption is
permitted. The amendments of this update should be applied using a
modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors
to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest
period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In
March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-07,
Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the
Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting ( ASU
2016-07 ). ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement to apply
the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting
entity obtains significant influence over a previously held
investment. ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption
of this standard would have on our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. 

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The guidance
simplifies accounting for share-based payments, most notably by
requiring all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be
recorded as income tax benefits or expense in the income statement
and by allowing entities to recognize forfeitures of awards when
they occur. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be adopted
prospectively or retroactively. We are currently evaluating the
impact the adoption of this standard would have on our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

NOTE 
3.  BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARES 

Basic
net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is based on
the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock
options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by
applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and
warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period
(or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained
thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market
price during the period. 

Diluted
net loss per share for the year ended June 30, 2016 did not reflect
the effects of shares potentially issuable upon conversion of
convertible notes   preferred stock. These potentially issuable
shares would have an anti-dilutive effect on the Company s
net loss per share in 2016. Diluted net income per share for the
year ended June 30, 2015 reflected the effects of shares actually
potentially issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred
stock. 

The
components of basic and diluted earnings per share were as

NOTE 
4. GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate
continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has an
accumulated deficit of $6,431,522 as of June 30 2016, including a
net loss of $81,952 during the year ended June 30, 2016. The
historical losses have adversely affected the liquidity of the
Company. Although losses are expected to be curtailed during the
coming fiscal year due to the increasing revenues of its wholly
owned subsidiary Kahnalytics, along with the acquisition of revenue
producing subsidiaries, the Company faces continuing significant
business risks, which include, but are not limited to, its ability
to maintain vendor and supplier relationships by making timely
payments when due, continue product research and development
efforts at Kahnalytics, and successfully compete for customers
within the areas of interest for its Canadian and New Zealand held
subsidiaries. 

In view
of the matters described in the preceding paragraph, recoverability
of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the
accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations
of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company s
ability to increase profitability from its subsidiary operations,
obtain financing, and succeed in its future operations. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or
amounts or classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

Management has
taken the following steps to revise its operating and financial
requirements, which it believes are sufficient to provide the
Company with the ability to continue as a going concern. Management
devoted considerable effort from inception through the period ended
June 30, 2016, towards (i) sourcing additional working capital
including $1,600,000 debt issuance completed during the year ended
June 30, 2016, (ii) management of accrued expenses and accounts
payable, (iii) divestiture of non-revenue producing subsidiaries,
(vi) acquisition of profit producing subsidiaries such as Gourmet
Foods and Brigadier Security Systems, and (v) other business
combinations between entities where we have a common controlling
interest such as Wainwright Holdings. 

Management believes
that the above actions will allow the Company to continue
operations for the next 12 months.

On
January 1, 2013 we consolidated all outstanding notes payable due a
related party into one loan agreement containing certain conversion
features whereby the note holder could convert the principal amount
of the loan, $204,700 comprised of the sum total of the principal
amounts of the individual notes, $122,000, plus $82,700 in accrued
interest applicable to those notes, together with accrued interest
on the principal at the rate of 4.944% per annum, into shares of
our common stock at the conversion rate of $0.02 per share. On
December 19, 2014 we entered into an amendment to the debenture
that allowed for the maturity date to be extended to June 1, 2015
and provided the Company rights to settle the debenture in full,
upon completion of an equity investment in excess of $1,500,000, by
payment of $122,000 in cash and issuance of 8,270,000 shares of
common stock valued at $0.01 per share to the debenture holder. On
January 26, 2015 we exercised those rights and paid the debenture
in full. The transaction resulted in a gain on the issuance of
shares of $69,861. which was recorded in additional paid in capital
account as the transaction was with a related party. 

On
February 13, 2015 the Company repaid the outstanding notes due to
two related parties totaling $21,000 in principal and $4,000 in
accrued interest. A total of $5,086 in accrued interest was
forgiven by the noteholders in settlement of the debt. 

Interest expense
for all related party notes payable for the year ended June 30,
2016 amounted to $782 and was $781 for the year ended June 30, 2015
for Concierge Technologies.

11. NOTE PAYABLE 

On
November 8, 2013 Wireless Village entered into a short term Note
Agreement with an unaffiliated individual in the amount of $50,000,
the proceeds of which were used to pay down inventory purchase
costs. Interest on the Note accrued at the rate of 10% per annum
and was payable in monthly installments with a maturity date of
February 19, 2014 payable by Wireless Village. On February 19, 2014
the unaffiliated individual agreed to extend the maturity date to
June 1, 2014 and the Company agreed to pay a loan commitment fee of
1.5%, or $750. By agreement, that fee was paid by the issuance of
53,571 shares of common stock with a market value on the date of
issuance of $0.014 per share. The note was subsequently extended to
mature on January 5,2015, and then again to mature on February 27,
2015 provided Concierge Technologies guaranteed the repayment on
behalf of Wireless Village. A fee in the amount of 1%, or $500, was
paid in cash to the noteholder by Wireless Village in exchange for
the agreement to extend the maturity date. On February 13, 2015 the
note was repaid in full by Concierge Technologies.

On
December 24, 2014 the Company entered into an unsecured promissory
note agreement with an unaffiliated individual for the principal
amount of $35,000 plus interest to accrue at the rate of 6% per
annum on the unpaid principal. The note and accrued interest was
due and payable on or before June 30, 2015. The proceeds of the
loan were reserved in anticipation of the need to pay a convertible
debenture maturing in January 2015. On January 26, 2015 the
noteholder became an investor and shareholder of the Company and
the amount of $35,000 due under the note agreement was repaid as a
credit to the amount of funds due per the stock subscription
agreement. No interest was accrued or paid on the
note. 

An
unsecured loan in the amount of $8,500 due a former director and
shareholder who is now deceased has been reclassified as a note due
unrelated party. The note is interest free, not deemed assignable
to successors by the Company, and held as a contingent liability
until resolved.

On
January 27, 2016 the Company entered into a convertible promissory
note (the  Promissory Note ) with Wainwright Holdings,
an affiliate of our shareholder and C.E.O., that resulted in the
funding of $450,000. The Promissory Note bears interest at four
percent (4%) per annum and increases to eight percent (8%) in the
event of default by the Company. The Company and the noteholder
negotiated the interest rate at arm s length relying upon the
available market rate for long-term deposits at financial
institutions as well as the current rate of return realized by the
noteholder for cash deposits currently held. Larger deposits
traditionally fall into a  Jumbo  rate category with
marginally higher returns. Interest ranged from annual percentage
rates of .01% at the lowest to 1.75% at the highest. Recognizing
the unsecured nature of the promissory note, and the historical
record of continued operating losses by the Company, a rate of 4
percent annual interest was agreed upon in light of the heightened
default risk over traditional investment instruments. The
Promissory Note may be prepaid at any time in whole or in part by
the Company and is convertible into restricted common stock of the
Company at the election of Promissory Note holder on the date which
is 180 days following issuance of the Promissory Note at a
conversion price of $0.10 per share. The conversion price is
subject to adjustment for mergers, consolidations, share exchanges,
recapitalizations or similar events. The Promissory Note matures
five (5) years from issuance and is unsecured. Proceeds from the
Promissory Note are intended to be used for transactions involving
acquisitions of unrelated companies by Concierge Technologies that
meet the criteria as determined by the Board of Directors. There
was no beneficial conversion feature identified as of the date of
issuance of the Promissory Note.

may repay the principal plus accrued interest at the rate of 8% per
annum by applying a pre-payment penalty determined on a sliding
scale tied to the aging of the note. After the initial 6-month
period has elapsed the Company may not repay the note until its
maturity date on January 25, 2015 at which time the note principal
and interest will become due and payable without pre-payment
penalty. The Company identified embedded derivatives related to the
convertible debenture. As of June 30, 2015 the debenture was repaid
in full with cash of $32,500 plus accrued interest of
$1,995. 

The
Company identified embedded derivatives related to all the three
convertible debenture mentioned above. The embedded
derivatives included certain conversion features.  The
accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments required
that the Company record the derivatives at their fair values as of
the inception date and at fair value as of each subsequent balance
sheet date.  Any change in fair value was recorded as
non-operating, non-cash income or expense at each reporting
date.  If the fair value of the derivatives was higher at
the subsequent balance sheet date, the Company recorded a
non-operating, non-cash charge.  If the fair value of the
derivatives was lower at the subsequent balance sheet date, the
Company recorded non-operating, non-cash income.  The
derivatives were classified as short-term liabilities. The
debentures were repaid in full with cash as of June 30, 2015 and
the derivative liability was eliminated on the consolidated balance
sheet at June 30, 2015.

Income
Tax Provision 

Provision for income tax as listed on the Consolidated Statements
of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are
$95,222 and $Nil, respectively. 

Provision for taxes
consisted of the following: 

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities  

Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences associated
with differences between the financial statements and tax basis of
assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates which
are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or
non-current, depending on the classification of the assets or
liabilities to which they relate. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities not related to an asset or liability are classified as
current or non-current depending on the periods in which the
temporary differences are expected to reverse. 

Through June 30, 2015, the Company incurred net operating losses
for tax purposes of approximately $5,033,209 which was increased to
$5,309,789 due to operating losses of $276,580 for the year ended
June 30, 2016. The net operating loss carryforward for federal and
state purposes may be used to reduce taxable income through the
year 2035. 

The gross deferred tax asset balance as of June 30, 2016 is
approximately $2,113,296. A 100% valuation allowance has been
established against the deferred tax assets, as the utilization of
the loss carry forward cannot be reasonably assured. 

Components of the deferred tax assets are limited to the Company's
net operating loss carryforwards, and are presented as follows at
June 30:

Tax
Rate Reconciliation 

Differences between
the benefit from income taxes and income taxes at the statutory
federal income tax rate are as follows for the years ended June
30: 

The
Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions when it is
probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The Company recognizes interest accrued
related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and
penalties in operating expenses. 

NOTE
16. 

   FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENT 

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 825-10 on January 1,
2008.  ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that
would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date.  When determining the fair value
measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be
recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most
advantageous market in which it would transact and considers
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the
asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions,
and risk of non-performance.  ASC 825-10 establishes a
fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
measuring fair value.  ASC 825-10 establishes three
levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair
value: 

45 

Level
1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities; 

Level
2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in
markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less
active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all
significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally
from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially
the full term of the assets or liabilities; and 

Level
3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are
significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or
liabilities. 

To
the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are
less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of
fair value requires more judgment.  In certain cases, the
inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of
the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, for disclosure
purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the
fair value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. 

Upon
adoption of ASC 825-10, there was no cumulative effect adjustment
to beginning retained earnings and no impact on the consolidated
financial statements. 

The
carrying value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term borrowings, and
other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value,
because of their short-term maturity. 

Items
recorded or measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements consisted of the
following items as of June 30, 2015:

The Company's derivative liability was valued using pricing models,
and the Company generally uses similar models to value similar
instruments.  Where possible, the Company verifies the
values produced by its pricing models to market
prices.  Valuation models require a variety of inputs,
including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit
spreads, measures of volatility, and correlations of such
inputs.  These financial liabilities do not trade in
liquid markets, and, as such, model inputs cannot generally be
verified and do involve significant management
judgment.  Such instruments are typically classified
within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The change
in fair value of the derivative liability is included as a
component of other income in the consolidated statements of
operations. The derivative liability was calculated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
expected lives range of less than a month; 110.48% stock price
volatility; risk-free interest rate of 0.110% and no dividends
during the expected term.

  BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS 

On May
28, 2015 Concierge Technologies, Inc. (the  Company )
entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of Gourmet Foods,
Ltd., a New Zealand corporation, subject to satisfactory completion
of due diligence and other customary criteria for a transaction of
this kind. Gourmet Foods is a baker of New Zealand meat pies and
other confections distributed to major grocery stores, convenience
stores, restaurants and other retailers throughout New Zealand. The
Company placed a cash deposit with Gourmet Foods in accordance with
the provisions of the asset purchase agreement, however the parties
later elected to change the nature of the transaction to a stock
purchase agreement. The Stock Purchase Agreement (the
 SPA ) was entered into on July 28, 2015 and was set to
close on July 31, 2015 subject to final adjustments to accounts
receivable, accounts payable, inventory, employee entitlements and
other current assets and liabilities. The Company paid a purchase
consideration of NZ$2,597,535 (approximately US$1,753,428) in cash.
An independent evaluation was conducted in order to obtain a fair
market value of the fixed assets and intangible assets acquired.
The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the
fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is
recorded as goodwill. 

On
August 11, 2015 the parties reached agreement to close the SPA
based on the balance sheet information as of July 31, 2015, subject
to further adjustments if necessary once certain balances became
known without dispute, and the Company remitted the remainder of
the purchase price in cash to an account in New Zealand established
for the benefit of the shareholders of Gourmet Foods, Ltd. The
operations of Gourmet Foods, Ltd. was consolidated going forward
with those of the Company as of August 1, 2015.

CD$2,010,266 (approximately US$1,540,830) in cash, payable in
several stages. As of June 30, 2016, consideration of CD$1,000,000
(US$756,859) was paid in cash and CD$733,000 (US$569,935) was
deposited in an attorney client trust account in Canadian currency
(to be paid to Brigadier, on the 183rd day following the Closing
Date if net sales meeting the minimum threshold of $1,500,000 CDN
(the "Sales Goal") is achieved; if the Sales Goal is not reached by
the l83rd day following the Closing Date, then the payment is to be
remitted on the 365th day following the Closing Date). The audit of
Brigadier resulted in an upwards adjustment of the purchase price
by CD$277,266 (US$214,035) which has been recorded as of June 30,
2016 as Purchase Consideration Payable and was subsequently paid in
October 2016. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total
purchase consideration is allocated to Brigadier Security Systems
net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the
fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is
recorded as goodwill. The following table summarizes the value of

segments for its products and services;U.S.A., New Zealand and
Canada. Our reportable segments are business units located in
different global regions.  The Company s operations in

gourmet meat pies and related bakery confections through its wholly
owned subsidiary Gourmet Foods, Ltd.  and in Canada security alarm system installation
and monitoring sold through its wholly owned subsidiary Brigadier
Security Systems to residential and commercial customers. Separate
management of each segment is required because each business unit
is subject to different operational issues and strategies due to
their particular regional location. The Company accounts for
intra-company sales and expenses as if the sales or expenses were
to third parties and eliminates them in the consolidation. Amounts

Our
principal independent accountant or any significant subsidiary has
not resigned, declined to stand for re-election, or been dismissed
by us during the periods for which financial statements are
included herein. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures . The Company carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,
including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as required by
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures are effective and provide
reasonable assurances that the information the Company is required
to disclose in the reports it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time period required by the Commission's rules
and forms. Further, the Company s officers concluded that its
disclosure controls and procedures are also effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to its management, including its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. There were no significant changes in
the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the
period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over
financial reporting. 

Internal
control over financial reporting. 

Management s report on internal
control over financial reporting . Our management recognizes
its responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Currently, the primary responsibility of the registrant is
providing oversight control over its subsidiary operations which,
in turn, are managed by their respective boards of directors who
are appointed by the registrant for each of the subsidiaries. All
debit and credit transactions with the company s bank
accounts, including those of the subsidiary companies, are reviewed
by the officers as well as all communications with the
company s creditors. The directors of the subsidiary
companies, which include representatives of the Company, meet
frequently   as often as weekly   to discuss and review
the financial status of the company and all developments. All
filings of reports with the Commission are reviewed before filing
by all directors. 

Our
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and
effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP).  Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of
the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Company s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 

54 

Management assessed
the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
financial reporting at the end of its most recent fiscal year, June
30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission in the 2013  Internal Control-Integrated
Framework .  Based on its evaluation, management
has concluded that the Company s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2016. 

Pursuant to
Regulation S-K Item 308(b), this Annual Report on Form 10-K does
not include an attestation report of our Company s registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control and Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, which were
identified in connection with our management s evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Act,
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Conflicts of Interest 

Our
officers and directors who are not employees of our subsidiary
company will not devote more than a portion of their time to our
affairs. There will be occasions when the time requirements of
Concierge's business conflict with the demands of their other
business and investment activities. Such conflicts may require that
we attempt to employ additional personnel. There is no assurance
that the services of such persons will be available or that they
can be obtained upon terms favorable to the company. 

Our
officers and directors may be directors or principal shareholders
of other companies and, therefore, could face conflicts of interest
with respect to potential acquisitions. In addition, our officers
and directors may in the future participate in business ventures,
which could be deemed to compete directly with Concierge.
Additional conflicts of interest and non-arms length transactions
may also arise in the future in the event our officers or directors
are involved in the management of any firm with which we transact
business. In addition, if Concierge and other companies with which
our officers and directors are affiliated both desire to take
advantage of a potential business opportunity, then our board of
directors has agreed that said opportunity should be available to
each such company in the order in which such companies registered
or became current in the filing of annual reports under the '34
Act. 

Our
officers and directors may actively negotiate or otherwise consent
to the purchase of a portion of their common stock as a condition
to, or in connection with, a proposed merger or acquisition
transaction. It is anticipated that a substantial premium over the
initial cost of such shares may be paid by the purchaser in
conjunction with any sale of shares by our officers and directors
which is made as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed
merger or acquisition transaction. The fact that a substantial
premium may be paid to our officers and directors to acquire their
shares creates a potential conflict of interest for them in
satisfying their fiduciary duties to us and our other shareholders.
Even though such a sale could result in a substantial profit to
them, they would be legally required to make the decision based
upon the best interests of Concierge and Concierge s other
shareholders, rather than their own personal pecuniary
benefit. 

No
executive officer, director, person nominated to become a director,
promoter or control person of Concierge has been involved in legal
proceedings during the last five years such as 

57 

bankruptcy, 

criminal
proceedings (excluding traffic violations and other minor
offenses), or 

proceedings
permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or
otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business,
securities or banking activities. 

Nor has
any such person been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in
a civil action, or the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or
commodities law. 

None of
the directors holds any directorships in any company with a class
of securities registered under the Exchange Act or subject to the
reporting requirements of section 15(d) of such Act or any company
registered as an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 other than the following: Nicholas Gerber, our CEO and
member of our Board of Directors, is a director of United Sates
Commodity Funds LLC which is the commodity pool operator and
general partner or sponsor of 11 commodity based exchange traded
products that are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act,
and is also a director of USCF ETF Trust, a registered investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which currently
has one exchange traded fund and is advised by USCF Advisers LLC, a
registered investment adviser. 

Involvement in certain legal
proceedings . During the past five years, none of the
directors has been involved in any of the following
events: 

A petition under
the Federal bankruptcy law or any state insolvency law was filed by
or against, or a receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer was
appointed by a court for the business or property of such person,
or any partnership in which he was a general partner at or within
two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or
business association of which he was an executive officer at or
within two years before the time of such filing; 

Such person was
convicted in a criminal proceeding or is a named subject of a
pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other
minor offenses); 

Such person was the
subject of any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently
reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent
jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining him from, or
otherwise limiting, the following activities: 

Other than Nicholas
Gerber, through his involvement as a director of United Sates
Commodity Funds LLC which is the commodity pool operator and
general partner or sponsor of 11 commodity based exchange traded
products that are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act,
and as a director of USCF ETF Trust, a registered investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which currently
has one exchange traded fund and is advised by USCF Advisers LLC, a
registered investment adviser, acting as a futures commission
merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity
pool operator, floor broker, leverage transaction merchant, any
other person regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
or an associated person of any of the foregoing, or as an
investment adviser, underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or

with such activity; 

58

Engaging in any

commodity or in connection with any violation of Federal or State

reversed, suspended or vacated, of any Federal or State authority
barring, suspending or otherwise limiting for more than 60 days the
right of such person to engage in any activity described in
paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, or to be associated with
persons engaged in any such activity; or 

Such person was
found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by
the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities
law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the
Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or

found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any
Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or

Code of
Ethics  .  We have
adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our principal executive
officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer
or controller, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of
the Code of Ethics is filed as an exhibit to Form 10-KSB Annual
Report for the year ended June 30, 2004 (Exhibit 14 incorporated
herein by reference). We undertake to provide to any person without
charge, upon request, a copy of such code of ethics. Such a request
may be made by writing to the company at its address at 29115
Valley Center Rd., K-206, Valley Center, CA 92082. 

Corporate Governance . 

Security holder recommendations of
candidates for the board of directors . Any shareholder may
recommend candidates for the board of directors by writing to the
president of our company the name or names of candidates, their
home and business addresses and telephone numbers, their ages, and
their business experience during at least the last five years. The
recommendation must be received by the company by March 9 of any
year or, alternatively, at least 60 days before any announced
shareholder annual meeting. 

59 

Audit committee . We have no
standing audit committee. Our directors perform the functions of an
audit committee. Our limited operations make unnecessary a standing
audit committee. None of our directors is an audit committee
financial expert, but the directors have access to consultants that
can provide such expertise when such is needed. 

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act .

ITEM 12.   SECURITY
OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS. 

The table below sets forth the ownership, as of
October 3, 2016, of each individual known to us to be the
beneficial owner of more than five percent of Concierge s
common stock  (5)  ,
by all directors, and named executive officers, individually and as
a group.  

61 

(1) 

  Gonzalez
  Kim is a California general partnership whose partners are
Hansu Kim and Matt Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzalez is a director of the
company. Their ownership is in the form of 350,086 shares of
Concierge Series B Voting, Convertible, Preferred stock that, when
converted at a ratio of 1:20, would equal to 7,001,720 shares of
common stock. Their ownership rights are equal, thus Mr. Gonzalez
is listed herein as a beneficial owner of 7,001,720 shares of
common stock. 

(2) 

  Mr.
Gerber is a beneficiary of the Nicholas and Melinda Living Trust
which holds 26,666,667 shares of common stock and 2,163,433 shares
of Series B Voting, Convertible Preferred stock that, when
converted at a ratio of 1:20, would equal 43,268,660 shares of
common stock. 

(3) 

  Mr.
Neibert owns 877,322 shares in his own name, and for the purposes
hereof, includes 676 shares of common stock held in the name of his
minor child included in the calculation. 

(4) 

  Mr.
Schoenberger is a beneficiary of the Schoenberger Family Trust
which holds 13,333,334 shares of common stock and 1,081,717 shares
of Concierge Series B Voting, Convertible, Preferred stock that,
when converted at a ratio of 1:20, would be equal to 21,634,340
shares of common stock. 

(5) 

  For
purposes of calculating total shares of common stock, all 3,754,355
Series B issued shares are treated as though they have been
converted into common stock. As of October 13, 2016, there were
67,953,870 shares of common stock issued and
outstanding. 

There
are no agreements between or among any of the shareholders that
would restrict the issuance of shares in a manner that would cause
any change in control of Concierge. There are no voting trusts,
pooling arrangements or similar agreements in the place between or
among any of the shareholders, nor do the shareholders anticipate
the implementation of such an agreement in the near
future. 

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 

Director Independence 

For
purposes of determining director independence, we have applied the
definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). The OTCQB on which
our shares of common stock are quoted does not have any director
independence requirements. The NASDAQ definition of
 Independent Director  means a person other than an
Executive Officer or employee of the Company or any other
individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the
Company's Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of
independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a
director. 

62 

According
to the NASDAQ definition, David Neibert and Nicholas Gerber are not
independent directors because each is also an executive officer of
the Company. Additional, Mr. Schoenberger is also not an
independent director due to the formation of a  group 
under Section 13(d)(3) with Mr. Gerber. According to the NASDAQ
Matt Gonzalez is the only independent director. 

We
do not have a standing audit, compensation or nominating committee,
but our entire board of director s acts in such
capacities.  We believe that our members of our board of
directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial
statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for
financial reporting. The board of directors of our company does not
believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because we
believe that the functions of an audit committee can be adequately
performed by the board of directors. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent director who would qualify as an
 audit committee financial expert  would be overly
costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances
given the early stages of our development. 

Related Party Transactions 

During
the previous two fiscal years preceding our last fiscal year to
present, there have been no transactions with related persons,
promoters or certain control persons as covered by Item 404 of
Regulation S-K. However, in connection with that certain Securities
Purchase Agreement with Nicholas Gerber and Scott Schoenberger,
certain now current executive officers and directors may have
formed a  group  under Section 13(d)(3) of the Act
which may result in related party transactions in the future. These
affiliations are disclosed herein 

On
January 26, 2015, we entered into a securities purchase agreement
(the  Securities Purchase Agreement ) with two
accredited investors, Nicholas Gerber and Scott Schoenberger, (the
 Purchasers ) pursuant to which we agreed to sell and
the Purchasers agreed to purchase 400,000,000 shares of common
stock and 32,451,499 shares of Series B preferred stock of the
Company in exchange for $3,000,000 USD. Pursuant to the terms of
the Securities Purchase Agreement, Purchasers acquired a
controlling interest in the Company pursuant to the issuance of the
above shares which constituted 70.0% of the voting control of the
Company. Following the closing of the Securities Purchase
Agreement, Mr. Gerber and Schoenberger became officers and
directors of the Company. 

On
September 19, 2016, the Company entered into a conditional Stock
Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ), dated September
19, 2016, with Wainwright Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
( Wainwright ) and certain shareholders of Wainwright
(the  Sellers ), pursuant to which the Sellers
conditionally agreed to sell, and the Company conditionally agreed
to purchase, shares representing approximately 97% of the total
issued and outstanding common stock of Wainwright (the
 Wainwright Shares ). The Company intends to make an
offer to acquire the remaining Wainwright shares of common stock
prior to the Closing. 

63 

As a
result of the transaction, current shareholders of Wainwright will
become shareholders of the Company. Mr. Gerber, along with certain
family members and certain other Wainwright shareholders, currently
own the majority of the common stock in the Company as well as
Wainwright. Following the closing of this transaction, he and those
shareholders will continue to own the majority of the Company
voting shares. 

Wainwright owns all
of the issued and outstanding limited liability company membership
interests of United States Commodity Funds LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ( USCF ) and USCF Advisers, LLC
( USCF Advisers ). USCF is a commodity pool operator
registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. USCF
Advisers is an SEC registered investment adviser. USCF and USCF
Advisers act as the advisers to the Funds set forth in the
Agreement (each, a  Fund , and collectively, the
 Funds ). 

The
Closing shall occur on the later of (i) the date that is two
Business Days following the date on which the last of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Articles VIII and IX of the
Agreement have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, waived by the relevant party, (ii)
the 21st calendar following the date on which the Definitive
Schedule 14C was mailed to the Concierge Shareholders, and (iii)
such other time and date as the parties may agree. 

The
conditions to the Closing of the Contemplated Transaction are more
particularly described in Articles VIII and IX of Exhibit 10.1
which is attached to the Form 8K submitted on September 19, 2016
and incorporated herein by this reference. The conditions to the
Closing include, but are not limited to, the Company s
receipt of a Fairness Opinion to the effect that, as of the date of
the Agreement, and based upon and subject to the limitations and
assumptions set forth in such opinion, the Purchase Price to be
paid by the Company pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of shares of the
Company. 

There
is no guarantee that the Closing of the Contemplated Transaction
will occur either as provided for in the Agreement or at all. There
is no guarantee that either the Company or Wainwright will fulfill
all conditions to Closing and that if not fulfilled, that either
party will waive the outstanding condition to Closing. 

Any
future transactions by and among the parties mentioned above may
qualify as related party transactions and will be disclosed
accordingly. 

We have
adopted a policy that any transactions with directors, officers or
entities of which they are also officers or directors or in which
they have a financial interest, will only be on terms consistent
with industry standards and approved by a majority of the
disinterested directors of the Board of Directors and based upon a
determination that these transactions are on terms no less
favorable to us than those which could be obtained by unaffiliated
third parties. This policy could be terminated in the future. In
addition, interested directors may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a
committee thereof which approves such a transaction.
