Note
1   Interim Financial Statements   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the rules and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required for audited annual financial statements. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to make the condensed consolidated
financial statements not misleading have been included. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015, has been derived from the
Company s audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.  

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto that are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, that was filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and Smile Producer, Inc., its wholly
owned subsidiary, which was incorporated in the State of Colorado on March 20, 2013. Intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.  

Note
2   Going Concern   

The
Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  

The
Company is in the development stage with limited trading history, has yet to achieve sustained profitability, does not have the
existing financial resources to fully implement its business plan and is consequently dependent on outside sources of financing
for continuation of its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern for a reasonable period.  

The
Company plans to improve its financial condition through raising capital, however, there is no assurance that the Company will
be successful in accomplishing this objective. Management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the Company to continue
as a going concern. The Company cannot give any assurances regarding the success of its management s plans. The Company s
financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded assets or liabilities that might be
necessary should it be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Note
3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

The
significant accounting policies followed by the Company for interim reporting are consistent with those included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no material changes to our significant accounting
policies during the interim period ended September 30, 2016.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing
revenue. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. The guidance provides a comprehensive framework for revenue recognition that supersedes current general
revenue guidance and most industry-specific guidance. In addition, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of
financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. The guidance
is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted.
However, entities reporting under U.S. GAAP are not permitted to adopt the standard earlier than the original effective date of
December 15, 2016. An entity should apply the guidance either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively
with the cumulative adjustment at the date of the initial application. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the
impact of adoption of the new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements and has not determined the impact of
adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  

Note
4   Notes Payable   Related Parties   

In
January 2015 and March 2015, the Company issued convertible notes payable to Venture Vest Capital Corporation, a related party,
in the total amount of $10,170. The notes had a maturity date of December 31, 2016, and were to pay zero interest through December
31, 2015, at which point an annual interest rate of 6% was to become effective until maturity. The notes were convertible at the
holders  discretion to shares of our common stock at a conversion ratio of $0.01 per common share; the notes were convertible
into an aggregate total of 1,017,000 of common stock. The Company reevaluated the embedded conversion feature and determined that
the convertible notes did not include a beneficial conversion feature since the fair value of the underlying common stock had
nominal value as of the grant dates of the convertible notes.  

In
September 2015, $2,170 of principal balance of the aforesaid notes was repaid and the remaining balance of $8,000 was canceled
and replaced with a new $8,000 non-convertible principal note payable to the same related party. This note was interest free until
December 31, 2015, after which time it would bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum, and its maturity date is December 31,
2016. In December 2015, this promissory note was amended to extend the interest-free period until December 31, 2016, after which
time it shall bear interest at an annual interest rate of 6% until repaid.  

In
September 2015, the Company issued a second non-convertible promissory note payable to Venture Vest Capital Corporation for $6,500.
The promissory note has a maturity date of December 31, 2016, and was interest free until December 31, 2015, at which time it
would bear an annual interest rate of 6% until maturity. In December 2015, this promissory note was amended to extend the interest-free
period until December 31, 2016, after which time it shall bear interest at an annual interest rate of 6% until repaid.  

In
August 2015, the Company issued a promissory note payable to Patrick Dunda, the Company s President and Chief Executive
Officer, for $2,200. The promissory note had a maturity date of December 31, 2016, and paid zero interest through May 31, 2016,
at which point an annual interest rate of 6% would have become effective until maturity. In March 2016, the Company repaid this
promissory note payable in full.  

In
March 2016, the Company issued a non-convertible promissory note payable to Terayco Enterprises, a company owned and operated
by the father of Janel Dunda, a principal of the Company, for $7,622. The promissory note has a maturity date of December 31,
2016, and is interest free until December 31, 2016, after which time it shall bear interest at an annual interest rate of 6% until
maturity or repaid.  

In
August 2016, the Company issued a promissory note payable to Patrick Dunda, the Company s President and Chief Executive
Officer, for $3,000. The promissory note has a maturity date of December 31, 2017, and pays zero interest through October 31,
2017, at which point an annual interest rate of 6% becomes effective until maturity or repayment.  

Note
5   Related Party Transactions   

Related
party revenue   

The
Company provides services to certain customers that the Company has determined to be related parties, as a principal of the Company,
Janel Dunda, is the daughter of the president of these customers (VentureVest Capital Corporation, Terayco, Americans for Truth,
and Carriage House).  

Revenues,
generated from website design services, from these related parties were $1,000 and $5,740 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, there were no accounts receivable due from related
parties.  

Related
party compensation   

An
employee of the Company, Janel Dunda, is considered a related party as she is the spouse of the President and a majority shareholder
of the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred compensation expense of $0 and
$15,175, respectively, for payroll expenses associated with Mrs. Dunda.  

Accrued
liabilities, related party   

In
August 2015, $4,000 of our legal expenses were paid by Terayco Enterprises, a company owned and operated by the father of Janel
Dunda, a principal of the Company. The Company recorded an accrued liability due to a related party as of December 31, 2015, for
this advance made by Terayco Enterprises. In January 2016, an additional $3,622 of our legal expenses, incurred and accrued in
2015, were paid by Terayco Enterprises. In March 2016, the Company issued a note payable, discussed above in Note 4, to Terayco
Enterprises in the amount of $7,622 to cover the legal expenses paid by Terayco Enterprises on behalf of the Company.  

Professional
fees paid by related party   

In
May 2016, $7,200 of professional fees associated with the preparation and audit of the Company s 2015 financial statements
were paid by Terayco Enterprises on behalf of the Company. These fees were recorded as contributed capital by Terayco Enterprises
since no consideration was paid, or will be paid, in exchange for these payments.  

Note
6   Stockholder Equity   

Common
Stock   

The
Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. All shares of the Company s
common stock have equal rights and privileges with respect to voting, liquidation and dividend rights. Each share of Common Stock
entitles the holder thereof to:  

a)  
      One
    non-cumulative vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders;   

b)  
      To
    participate equally and to receive any and all such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally
    available therefore; and   

c)  
      To
    participate pro rata in any distribution of assets available for distribution upon liquidation.   

Stockholders
have no pre-emptive rights to acquire additional shares of common stock or any other securities. Common shares are not subject
to redemption and carry no subscription or conversion rights. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable.  

In
2015, the Company filed an S-1 Registration Statement to register 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to be sold
to the public at the price of $0.05 per share for a total of $50,000. The Registration Statement became effective on December
30, 2015. No shares of the Company s common stock were sold to the public in 2015. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company sold 83,000 shares at $0.05 per share for gross proceeds of $4,150. The shares were sold by the officers
and Directors of the Company and no broker commissions were paid as a result of the sales. There can be no assurances that additional
shares of common stock will be sold on the S-1 offering or that a trading market will develop for the shares.  

As
of September 30, 2016, 5,083,000 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding.  

Note
7   Subsequent Events   

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date of the filing of this interim report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation,
the Company did not identify any significant subsequent events that would have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements, which would require an adjustment and/or additional disclosure.  

Item 2.
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Our
Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report.  

Forward-Looking
Statements    

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking statements  that include information relating to future events,
future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment, regulation and availability of resources. These
forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding: proposed new products or services; our statements
concerning litigation or other matters; statements concerning projections, predictions, expectations, estimates or forecasts for
our business, financial and operating results and future economic performance; statements of management s goals and objectives;
trends affecting our financial condition, results of operations or future prospects; our financing plans or growth strategies;
and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as  may,   will, 
 should,   could,   would,   predicts,   potential,   continue, 
 expects,   anticipates,   future,   intends,   plans,   believes 
and  estimates,  and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.   

Forward-looking
statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications
of the times at, or by which, that performance or those results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information
available at the time they are made and/or management s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events,
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed
in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual
results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to the extent required
by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will
make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.   

Business
Overview   

Frontier
Digital Media Group, Inc. ( we,  us,   our,  or the  Company ) was incorporated in the
state of Colorado on September 19, 2011. On March 20, 2013, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary company, Smile Producer, Inc.,
a Colorado corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 2605 Red Hawk Ridge Drive, Castle Rock, Colorado 80109,
telephone 303-999-8171.  

We
are a digital design and media company which develops and maintains websites and is a provider of marketing communications services
to customers in the United States. We conduct our operations primarily through Smile Producer, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary
company.  

We
provide a range of marketing communications and consulting services, including all types of advertising, print and digital design,
digital motion graphics and client website construction, interactive and mobile marketing, direct marketing, sales promotion,
market research, corporate identity and branding, social media and other marketing related services. We have two revenue streams,
marketing services and website hosting subscriptions.  

As
of the date of this filing our management only devotes approximately 35-50 hours in the aggregate per week to our affairs. This
time may increase if and when our business activity increases, of which there is no assurance.  

We
have not yet generated sustained profits from our operations. Our independent accountants have expressed a  going concern 
opinion.  

From
our inception to date, we have generated very little revenues, and our operations have been limited to organizational, start-up,
and capital formation activities and limited sales. We currently have no employees other than our two officers, who are also directors.  

In
2015, the Company filed an S-1 Registration Statement to register 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to be sold
to the public at the price of $0.05 per share for a total of $50,000. The Registration Statement became effective on December
30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had sold 83,000 shares of common stock at $0.05 per share for gross proceeds of
$4,150. The shares were sold by the officers and Directors of the Company and no broker commissions were paid. There is no guarantee
that additional shares will be sold from the Registration Statement.  

Even
if all of the shares offered on the S-1 Registration Statement are sold, our management will continue to own over a majority of
the outstanding shares of the Company. As a result, they have the ability to determine the outcome on all matters requiring approval
of our shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.  

Based
upon our current business plan, we may continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future and there can be no assurances that
we will ever establish profitable operations. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern.  

Critical
Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates   

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

An
accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters
that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or
changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenue
is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, such as when a purchase order or contract is received from a
customer, the price is fixed, title to the goods has passed or services have been rendered, and there is reasonable assurance
of collection. The Company classifies selling discounts and rebates, if any, as a reduction of revenue.  

Accounts
receivable   

The
Company reviews accounts receivable periodically for collectability and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts and records
bad debt expense when deemed necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers 
inability to make required payments. If there is deterioration of our customers  credit worthiness and/or there is an increase
in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used, additional allowances may
be required. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, no allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for future income taxes. Under this method, future income tax assets
and liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their corresponding
tax basis. In addition, the future benefits of income tax assets including unused tax losses, are recognized, subject to a valuation
allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that such future benefits will ultimately be realized. Future income tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply when the tax liabilities or assets are
to be either settled or realized. The Company s effective tax rate approximates the Federal statutory rates.  

Results
of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015   

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated revenues of $2,418 and $7,599, respectively, compared to revenues
of $3,766 and $15,901, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, decreases of $1,348 and $8,302,respectively,
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decreases in revenues were attributable to a reduction in our customer
and client base, resulting in decreased billings. Due to our limited resources, our efforts were directed towards existing contracts
and not towards marketing our services to prospective new clients and new projects.  

Operating
expenses, including general and administrative expense, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $3,699
and $15,120, respectively, compared to $6,313 and $28,512, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015.  

The
decrease of $2,614 in operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the same period during
2015 was primarily attributed to decreases of $2,200 in related party compensation and $414 in professional fees and other administrative
costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
decrease of $13,392 in operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the same period during
2015 was primarily attributed to a decrease of $15,175 in related party compensation, partially offset by increases in professional
fees related to preparing and filing the Company s annual and interim reports with the SEC.  

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred $8,125 and $10,170, respectively, in other expenses that we did
not incur during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The other expenses during the nine months ended September
30, 2015, consisted of a loss on debt modification of $8,125, which was the result of eliminating the conversion feature on notes
payable to a related party discussed above in Note 4 of the financial statements, and $2,045 of interest expense associated the
amortization of a beneficial conversion feature recorded in January 2015 and March 2015 when the convertible notes payable were
issued to the related party.  

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $1,281 and $7,521, respectively, compared
to a net loss of $10,672 and $22,781 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease in
the net loss of $9,391 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was related to the decrease of $8,125 in other expenses,
a decrease of $2,614 in operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $1,348 in revenues as discussed above. The decrease
in net loss of $15,260 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was related to the decrease of $10,170 in other expenses,
a decrease of $13,392 in operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $8,302 in revenues as discussed above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $9,168, an increase of $5,359 from a balance of $3,809 at December 31, 2015. This
increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was the result of net cash provided by financing activities of $12,572,
partially offset by cash used for operations of $7,213 during the period.  

Operating
Activities    

Net
cash used in operating activities was $7,213 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $19,682 used in operating
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $12,469 decrease in cash used in operations was due to a decrease
in net loss of $15,260 and a decrease of $7,379 in working capital requirements, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash expenses
of $10,170, associated with a loss on debt modification and amortization of discount on convertible notes to a related party recorded
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Investing
Activities    

We
neither generated nor used cash in investing activities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Financing
Activities    

Cash
flows provided by financing activities were $12,572 and $16,700 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold 83,000 shares of common stock at $0.05 per share for gross proceeds
of $4,150. The shares were sold by the officers and Directors of the Company and no broker commissions were paid as a result of
the sales.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repaid promissory notes payable issued to related parties in the amount
of $2,200.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued non-convertible promissory notes payable to related parties in the
amount of $10,622.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued convertible notes payable to a related party in the total amount
of $10,170. In September 2015, $2,170 of principal balance of the convertible notes payable was repaid and the remaining balance
of $8,000 was canceled and replaced with a new $8,000 non-convertible principal note payable to the same related party.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued non-convertible notes payables to related parties in the amount of
$8,700.  

Going
Concern    

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the
accompanying financial statements, we have incurred net losses of $7,521 and $22,781 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and have a working capital deficit of $15,264 as of September 30, 2016, which raises substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

Management
believes the Company will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future
and will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash
flows, if ever. Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for the Company, but cannot assure that such
financing will be available on acceptable terms.  

In
2015, the Company filed an S-1 Registration Statement to register 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to be sold
to the public at the price of $0.05 per share for a total of $50,000. The Registration Statement became effective on December
30, 2015. As of the date of this filing, the Company has sold 83,000 shares of common stock at $0.05 per share for gross proceeds
of $4,150.  

The
shares were sold by the officers and Directors of the Company and no broker commissions were paid. There is no guarantee that
additional shares will be sold from the Registration Statement.  

The
funds raised on the offering will be used for the payment of costs incurred in the filing of the S-1 Registration Statement and
for operating capital for the Company.  

While
management believes that income generated from sales activities of the Company will be sufficient to sustain the company, with
the filing of the S-1 Registration Statement, the Company will become a  Reporting Company  as that term is defined
by the SEC. As a  Reporting Company , we will be filing quarterly and annual reports with the SEC, thus incurring
the additional costs of audits and legal fees.  

While
it is hoped that the sale of common stock will be sufficient to meet the financial needs of the Company for the next 12 months,
it may be necessary for current management to advance the Company additional funds to meet the needs of the Company.  

Our
current management has agreed to advance funds to the Company on an  as needed  basis.  

  Should
existing management, stockholders or our affiliates refuse to advance needed funds, however, we would be forced to turn to outside
parties to either lend funds to us or buy our securities. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary funds,
when needed, from outside sources. Such a lack of funds could result in severe consequences to us, including among others:  

failure
    to make timely filings with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act, which may also result in suspension of trading or quotation
    of our stock and could result in fines and penalties to us under the Exchange Act; and   

failure
    to increase sales and income for the company.   

The
Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate
sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations, and obtain additional financing as may be required. The accompanying financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that management
will be successful in implementing its business plan or that the successful implementation of such business plan will actually
improve our operating results.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Inflation   

We
do not believe that inflation has had in the past or will have in the future any significant negative impact on our operations.  

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

Not
required for smaller reporting companies.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our chief
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded such controls and procedures to be ineffective as of September
30, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms
and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is
accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

In
connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the interim periods during
2016, due to resource constraints, material weaknesses became evident to management regarding our inability to generate all the
necessary disclosure for inclusion in our filings with the Securities and Exchanges Commission (the  SEC ) due to the
lack of resources and segregation of duties. A material weakness is a significant deficiency in one or more of the internal control
components that alone or in the aggregate precludes our internal controls from reducing to an appropriately low level the risk
that material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

Change
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We intend to recruit additional
professionals, as our business conditions warrant, to ensure that we include all necessary disclosure in our filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe that these corrective steps will enable management to conclude that the
internal controls over our financial reporting are effective when the staff is in place and trained, we cannot provide assurance
that these steps will be sufficient. We may be required to expend additional resources to identify, assess and correct any additional
weaknesses in internal control .
