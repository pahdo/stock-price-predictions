(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
   
  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet   as of September 24, 2016  , the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015  , and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Shareholders' Equity for the   thirty-nine week   periods then ended have been prepared by the Company, without audit. In the opinion of management, all necessary adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) have been made to present fairly the financial statements as of   September 24, 2016   and for all periods presented. 
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 26, 2015  . The accounting policies and methods of computation followed in these interim financial statements are the same as those followed in the financial statements for the year ended   December 26, 2015  .  The results of operations for the period ended   September 24, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. 
  Inventories 
  Approximately   38%   and   39%   of inventory is valued at the lower of cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market as of   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015  . All other inventory is valued at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or market. Finished goods and manufactured goods inventories include the costs of acquired raw materials and related factory labor and overhead charges required to convert raw materials to manufactured and finished goods. The excess of replacement cost of inventories over the LIFO value is approximately   $38,267   and   $35,075   at   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015  , respectively.  
  Inventories consisted of the following:

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
  Income Taxes 
  Earnings before income taxes and equity in earnings of nonconsolidated subsidiaries for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015  , were as follows: 

Pension Benefits 
  The Company incurs expenses in connection with the Delta Pension Plan ("DPP").  The DPP was acquired as part of the Delta plc acquisition in fiscal 2010 and has no members that are active employees. In order to measure expense and the related benefit obligation, various assumptions are made including discount rates used to value the obligation, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses and estimated future inflation rates.  These assumptions are based on historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances.  An actuarial analysis is used to measure the expense and liability associated with pension benefits. 
    
  The components of the net periodic pension (benefit) expense for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015   were as follows: 

Stock Plans 
    
  The Company maintains stock based compensation plans approved by the shareholders, which provide that the Human Resource Committee of the Board of Directors may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, non-vested stock awards and bonuses of common stock. At   September 24, 2016  ,   884,562   shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the plans. Shares and options issued and available are subject to changes in capitalization. 
  Under the plans, the exercise price of each option equals the closing market price at the date of the grant. Options vest beginning on the first anniversary of the grant in equal amounts over   three   to   six   years or on the fifth anniversary of the grant.

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
  Expiration of grants is from   seven   to   ten   years from the date of grant. The Company's compensation expense (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) and associated income tax benefits related to stock options for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015  , respectively, were as follows: 

Equity Method Investments 
  The Company has equity method investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries, which are recorded within "Other assets" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
  Fair Value 
  The Company applies the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 820,   Fair Value Measurements   ( ASC 820 ) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of ASC 820 apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. As defined in ASC 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
  ASC 820 establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 
  The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
  Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 
  Trading Securities: The assets and liabilities recorded for the investments held in the Valmont Deferred Compensation Plan of   $36,925   (  $37,963   at December 26, 2015) represent mutual funds, invested in debt and equity securities, classified as trading securities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 320,   Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities  , considering the employee's ability to change investment allocation of their deferred compensation at any time.

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
  The Company's ownership of shares in Delta EMD Pty. Ltd. (JSE:DTA) is also classified as trading securities.  The shares are valued at   $1,721   and   $4,734   as of   September 24, 2016   and December 26, 2015, respectively, which is the estimated fair value.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company received a dividend of   $1,541   from Delta EMD Pty. Ltd and the market price of the shares were proportionately reduced accordingly.  Quoted market prices are available for these securities in an active market and therefore categorized as a Level 1 input.

Comprehensive Income 
  Comprehensive income includes net earnings, currency translation adjustments, certain derivative-related activity and changes in net actuarial gains/losses from a pension plan. Results of operations for foreign subsidiaries are translated using the average exchange rates during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet dates. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of the following at   September 24, 2016   and December 26, 2015: 

Net Investment Hedge 
    In the second quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a one-year foreign currency forward contract which qualified as a net investment hedge, in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on a portion of our investments denominated in British pounds.  No ineffectiveness resulted from the hedge and the balance is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Other Comprehensive Income within gain/(loss) on hedging activities.  The realized gain (loss) will be deferred in other comprehensive income where it will remain until the net investments in our British subsidiaries are divested.  The unrealized gain recorded at Septemb  er 24, 2016 is   $4,897   and     is included in Other Current Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-9,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in   Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605,   Revenue Recognition  .   The new revenue recognition standard   requires entities to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-9 was to be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is to be applied retrospectively.   In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date by one year to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
    In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . Under this ASU, inventory will be measured at the  lower of cost and net realizable value  and options that currently exist for  market value  will be eliminated. The ASU defines net realizable value as the  estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  No other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement. ASU 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and should be applied prospectively. The Company is evaluating the provisions of this statement, including which period to adopt, and has not determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have on the Company's financial position or results of operations. The Company plans to adopt this ASU in fiscal 2017.   
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which provides guidance requiring debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability and further clarification guidance allows the cost of securing a revolving line of credit to be recorded as a deferred asset regardless of whether a balance is outstanding. The Company retrospectively adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2016 and reclassified approximately $7,000 of debt issuance cost for its long-term debt (excluding its revolving line of credit) to a direct reduction of long-term debt instead of an other asset in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for December 26, 2015.   
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which provides revised guidance on leases requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating leases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied on a modified retrospective transition.   The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which provides revised guidance for employee share-based compensation payments.  The ASU requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. It also states excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity whereas currently it is classified within a financing cash flow activity. ASU 2016-09 is effective prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.   The Company early adopted this guidance prospectively in the second quarter of 2016 which resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $289.

(2) ACQUISITIONS 
  On September 30, 2015, the Company purchased American Galvanizing for   $12,778   in cash, net of cash acquired, plus assumed liabilities.  American Galvanizing operates a custom galvanizing operation in New Jersey with annual sales of approximately   $10,000  .  In the purchase price allocation, goodwill of   $3,019   and   $2,178   of customer relationships, trade name and other intangible assets were recorded.  Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.  This business is included in the Coatings segment and was acquired to expand the Company's geographic presence in the Northeast United States.  The purchase price allocation was finalized in the first quarter of 2016.  Pro-forma disclosures were omitted as this business did not have a significant impact on the Company's 2015 or 2016 financial results. 
  Acquisitions of Noncontrolling Interests 
  In April 2016, the Company acquired the remaining   30%   of IGC Galvanizing Industries (M) Sdn Bhd that it did not own for   $5,841  .  In June 2016, the Company acquired   5.2%   of the remaining   10%   of Valmont SM that it did not own for   $5,168  .  As these transactions were for acquisitions of part or all of the remaining shares of consolidated subsidiaries with no change in control, they were recorded within shareholders' equity and as a financing cash flow in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
   
  3) RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES       
  2016 Plan 
    
  In July 2016, the Company identified a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand (the "2016 Plan") focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the Energy and Mining and Coatings segments.  During the last six months of fiscal 2016, the Company estimates it will incur the following pre-tax expenses from the 2016 Plan:

During fiscal 2015, the Company substantially completed this 2015 Plan and recognized   $21,708   of pre-tax restructuring expenses in cost of sales and   $18,144   of pre-tax restructuring expenses in selling, general, and administrative expenses.  Within the total fiscal 2015 pre-tax restructuring expense of   $39,852   were pre-tax asset impairments of   $19,836  .

In its determination of these intangible assets as indefinite lived, the Company considered such factors as its expected future use of the intangible asset, legal, regulatory, technological and competitive factors that may impact the useful life or value of the intangible asset and the expected costs to maintain the value of the intangible asset. The Company expects that these intangible assets will maintain their value indefinitely. Accordingly, these assets are not amortized.       
  The Company s trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2016. The values of each trade name was determined using the relief-from-royalty method. Based on this evaluation, no trade names were determined to be impaired as of the third quarter of 2016.  In the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a   $5,000   impairment of the Webforge trade name (in Energy   Mining segment) and a   $1,100   impairment of the Industrial Galvanizing trade name (in Coatings segment).  The Company also recognized an additional   $830   impairment of the Webforge trade name in the fourth quarter of 2015.

(4) GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Continued) 
  Goodwill 
  The carrying amount of goodwill by segment as of   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015   was as follows: 

The Company s annual impairment test of goodwill was performed during the third quarter of 2016, using the discounted cash flow method.  As a result of that testing, the Company determined that its goodwill was not impaired, as the valuation of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values.  The Company's offshore and other complex steel structures reporting unit with   $13,872   of goodwill, is the reporting unit with the least amount of cushion between its estimated fair value and its carrying value.  In the impairment model, the Company is forecasting steady growth in sales between 2018 to 2020 of the other complex steel structures to offset the significant decline in sales from offshore oil and gas structures realized in fiscal 2016.  If this reporting unit is not able to build out a backlog of other product lines projects during 2017 to construct and deliver in fiscal 2018, an interim impairment test may be required before the next annual impairment test.  The Company continues to monitor changes in the global economy that could impact future operating results of its reporting units.  If such conditions arise, the Company will test a given reporting unit for impairment prior to the annual test.   
  In the third quarter of 2015, the APAC Coatings reporting unit failed step one in that the estimated fair value was lower than the carrying value.  As a result, the Company recorded a   $9,100   impairment of goodwill on the APAC Coatings reporting unit. The Company finalized step two of the impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2015 and recorded an additional impairment of   $7,122  , which was the remaining goodwill of this reporting unit. The Company also recorded an   $18,670   impairment of access system's goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
   
  (5) CASH FLOW SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
  The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash payments for interest and income taxes (net of refunds) for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were as follows:

Share Repurchase Programs       
    
  On May 13, 2014, the Company announced a new capital allocation philosophy which increased the dividend by   50%   and covered a share repurchase program of up to   $500,000   of the Company's outstanding common stock to be acquired from time to time over   twelve months   at prevailing market prices, through open market or privately-negotiated transactions.  On February 24, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an additional purchase of up to   $250,000   of the Company's outstanding common stock with no stated expiration date.  As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company has acquired   4,531,259   shares for approximately   $610,600   under the share repurchase programs.   

(6) EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  The following table provides a reconciliation between Basic and Diluted earnings per share (EPS): 

Earnings per share are computed independently for each of the quarters.  Therefore, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share may not equal the total for the year primarily due to the share buyback program. 
  At   September 24, 2016   and September 26, 2015, there were   378,566   and   433,401   outstanding stock options with exercise prices exceeding the market price of common stock that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, respectively.

(7) BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company changed its reportable segment structure to improve transparency. The Company now has   five   reportable segments and its management structure was changed to align with this new reporting structure. A new reportable segment, Energy   Mining, includes the businesses primarily serving the energy and mining end markets.  This segment includes the access systems applications businesses and offshore structures business that was formerly part of the Engineered Infrastructure Products (EIP) segment, and the grinding media business that was formerly included in the "Other" category.  The remaining businesses from the EIP segment was also renamed "Engineered Support Structures".   The last change in the reporting structure was moving the tubing business from the "Other" category to the Irrigation segment.  Prior year information in this footnote has been updated to match the new reportable segment structure. 
  Reportable segments are as follows: 
    
  ENGINEERED SUPPORT STRUCTURES:   This segment consists of the manufacture of engineered metal 
  structures and components for the global lighting and traffic, wireless communication, and roadway safety 
  industries; 
    
  ENERGY AND MINING:   This segment, all outside of the United States, consists of the manufacture of 
  access systems applications, forged steel grinding media, on and off shore oil, gas, and wind energy structures; 
    
  UTILITY SUPPORT STRUCTURES:   This segment consists of the manufacture of engineered steel and 
  concrete structures for the global utility industry; 
    
  COATINGS:   This segment consists of galvanizing, anodizing and powder coating services on a global 
  basis; and 
    
  IRRIGATION:   This segment consists of the manufacture of agricultural irrigation equipment and related 
  parts and services for the global agricultural industry and tubular products for industrial customers. 
       
  Due to the business reorganization and restructuring activities that occurred in 2015, there are no longer business operations included in Other for fiscal 2016. In 2015, the Company had other businesses and activities that individually were not more than   1%   of consolidated sales.  
  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1. The Company evaluates the performance of its business segments based upon operating income and invested capital. The Company does not allocate interest expense, non-operating income and deductions, or income taxes to its business segments.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  Management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements are based on assumptions that management has made in light of experience in the industries in which the Company operates, as well as management s perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company s control) and assumptions. Management believes that these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions. Many factors could affect the Company s actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements. These factors include, among other things, risk factors described from time to time in the Company s reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as future economic and market circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results, operating efficiencies, availability and price of raw materials, availability and market acceptance of new products, product pricing, domestic and international competitive environments, and actions and policy changes of domestic and foreign governments. 
  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto, and the management's discussion and analysis included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 26, 2015  . Segment sales in the table below are presented net of intersegment sales.

Overview    
  On a consolidated basis, the decrease in net sales in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with 2015, reflected lower sales in all reportable segments.  The changes in net sales in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, were as follows: 

Volume effects are estimated based on a physical production or sales measure. Since products we sell are not uniform in nature, pricing and mix relate to a combination of changes in sales prices and the attributes of the product sold. Accordingly, pricing and mix changes do not necessarily directly result in operating income changes. We acquired American Galvanizing in October 2015 and it is reported in the Coatings segment.  
    
   Average steel index prices for both hot rolled coil and plate decreased substantially in North America throughout 2015 before bottoming during the first quarter of 2016.  Steel prices then strengthened quickly during the second quarter of 2016 but then weakened in August and September.  The effect of changing steel prices does not necessarily affect sales and costs of sales immediately.  Decreases in average sales pricing and volumes offset the increase in gross profit realized from the lower cost of steel.   
    
  Restructuring Plan  
    
  In July 2016, the Company identified a restructuring plan in Australia/New Zealand (the "2016 Plan") focused primarily on closing and consolidating locations within the Energy and Mining and Coatings segments.  The Company estimates it will incur pre-tax expenses from the 2016 Plan of $4.8 million, of which $2.1 million were recognized in the third quarter of 2016. The Energy and Mining segment incurred approximately $1.6 million, the Coatings segment incurred approximately $0.3 million, and Corporate incurred approximately $0.2 million of restructuring expenses during the third quarter of 2016.       
    
  In April 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a broad restructuring plan (the "2015 Plan") that was substantially completed by the end of December 2015.  During third quarter of 2016, the Company's Utility segment recognized $0.5 million, Corporate recognized $1.6 million, ESS recognized $0.6 million, and Coatings recognized $0.2 million of pre-tax  
  
   35 

restructuring expense related to the 2015 Plan. During the third quarter and first three quarters of 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $8.8 million and $23.8 million, respectively.   
    
  The decrease in third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015 gross profit by segment from the restructuring activities is as follows: 
    
            Gross Profit    

The decrease in third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015 operating income due to restructuring expense by segment is as follows: 
    
              Operating Income  

Currency Translation  
    
  In the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, we realized a decrease in operating profit, as compared with fiscal 2015, due to currency translation effects. On average, the U.S. dollar strengthened in particular against the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, euro, and South African rand, resulting in less operating profit in U.S. dollar terms. The effects were minimal when comparing third quarter 2016 to the same period in 2015.  The breakdown of this effect by segment was as follows:       

Gross Profit, SG A, and Operating Income     
    
  At a consolidated level, the improvement in gross margin (gross profit as a percent of sales) in the first three quarters of 2016, as compared with 2015, was due to restructuring activities undertaken in 2015 and lower raw material prices across most of our businesses that was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Raw material prices increased in the third quarter of 2016 which is why the gross margin improvement was lower than what was realized during the first half of 2016.  Gross profit increased in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 2015, for all operating segments except for Coatings and Utility.  Gross profit in the third quarter of 2016 decreased for both segments due to lower sales volumes.  Reduced average selling prices also resulted in a decline in gross profit for the Coatings segment. 
     
  The Company incurred $3.2 million of restructuring expense in the third quarter (and year-to-date) of 2016 within selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses.  The Company incurred $4.0 million and $10.6 million of restructuring expense within SG A in the third quarter and the first three quarters of fiscal 2015, respectively.  Excluding restructuring expense, the Company saw a decrease in SG A in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with the same periods in 2015, mainly due to the following factors: 
  
   36 

currency translation effects of $0.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and South African rand; and 
                
    reversal of $2.6 million and $3.5 million of a contingent consideration liability, respectively, for the former owners of Pure Metal Galvanizing in 2016. 
       
  The above reductions were partially offset by the following increases in SG A expenses in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with the same periods in 2015: 

increased incentive expenses due to improved operating performance of $1.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively; and 
                
    higher deferred compensation expenses of $3.2 million and $2.5 million, which were offset by a decrease of the same amount of other expense. 
       
  In the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015, operating income for all operating segments were higher except for Irrigation and the ESS segment. The increase in operating income on a reportable segment basis in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared to 2015, was realized in all reportable segments except for Irrigation. The increase in operating income for 2016, as compared to 2015, is primarily attributable to reduced expenses (the 2015 restructuring activities), no goodwill or intangible asset impairments in 2016, and reduced overall SG A spending. 
    
  Net Interest Expense and Debt  
       
  Net interest expense in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with the same periods in 2015, were consistent due to minimal changes in short and long-term borrowings. 
    
  Other Expense  
    
  The decrease in other expense in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared with 2015, was primarily due to a change in valuation of deferred compensation assets which resulted in other income of approximately $3.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively.  This amount is offset by an increase of the same amount in SG A.  The change in the market value of the Company's shares held of Delta EMD was favorable ($0.1 million) in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to a $0.4 million loss in 2015. For the first three quarters of 2016, the loss on Delta EMD shares was $1.0 million versus no gain or loss for the same period of 2015.  
    
  Income Tax Expense  
       
  Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 was 32.6% and 31.7%, respectively, compared to 47.0% and 36.5% in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2015, respectively.  The rate decrease in 2016 can be primarily attributed to the APAC Coatings goodwill impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2015 that was not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $1.8 million of deferred income tax expense during the third quarter of 2016 related to decreased future corporate tax rates in the United Kingdom.   
    
  Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was relatively flat in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with the same periods in 2015. 
    
  Cash Flows from Operations 
    
  Our cash flows provided by operations were approximately   $127.3 million   in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with $182.8 million provided by operations in 2015.  The decrease in operating cash flow in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with 2015, was the result of higher net working capital.  

37 

Engineered Support Structures (ESS) segment 
  The slight decrease in net sales in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 as compared with 2015 was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and lower average sales pricing due to lower steel prices primarily in our lighting and traffic product lines.  These reductions were partially offset by improved volumes in the China and Australia telecommunication business. 
  Global lighting and traffic, and roadway product sales in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016 were higher compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015. In the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, sales volumes in the U.S. were higher in the commercial steel market, higher in the aluminum markets, and modestly lower in the transportation markets.  We expect transportation markets to pick up in next few quarters due to the long-term highway bill that was signed in 2015.  Sales in Canada decreased in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016 as compared to 2015, from lower volumes due to less large projects and unfavorable currency impacts.  Sales in Europe were lower in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015, due to unfavorable currency translation effects and lower volumes primarily related to a large project in the Middle East that was ongoing in 2015.  The domestic markets in general remain subdued in Europe.  In the Asia-Pacific region, sales were higher in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared to 2015, due primarily to improved investment activity in both China and Australia and overall market growth in India.  Roadway product sales decreased in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016 due to lower volumes.  On a year-to-date basis, roadway product sales also decreased due to unfavorable currency translation effects. 
  Communication product line sales were lower in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with the same periods in fiscal 2015. North America communication structure and component sales decreased, due to lower demand in the market. In China, sales of wireless communication structures in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 increased over the same period in 2015 as the investment levels by the major wireless carriers have remained strong and we have increased our market share through better sales coverage.  In Australia, sales for wireless communication structures improved in 2016 due to higher demand from the national broadband network build out. 
  Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, and operating income for the segment were higher in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, due to margin expansion from reduced raw material costs, growth in the Asia-Pacific telecommunication business, and lower costs resulting from the 2015 restructuring activities. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation effects and lower sales volumes in Europe and the North American wireless communication businesses.  The LIFO reserve adjustment was also less favorable in 2016 as compared to 2015. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales was slightly higher, and operating income was lower in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 2015.  The lower operating income in the third quarter of 2016 is due to higher SG A costs.  SG A spending in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016 was increased over the same periods in 2015 due primarily to increased commissions owed on the higher telecommunication sales in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Energy   Mining (E M) segment  
    The decrease in net sales in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 2015, was due to lower volumes that were partially offset by favorable currency translation effects. The decrease in net sales in the first three quarters of 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to unfavorable currency translation effects and lower volumes.   
  Access systems product line net sales in the third quarter of 2016 were flat when compared to the same period in 2015. The net sales decreased in the first three quarters of 2016, as compared with 2015, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation effects and lower sales prices in Asia.   The year-to-date decrease in sales price is primarily related to fewer oil and gas related construction projects in the Asia-Pacific region.    
  Offshore and other complex structures sales increased in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015.  The increase can be attributed to volume improvements primarily in the wind tower product line.  Oil and gas product activity continues to be slow due to low oil prices that has caused some previously planned projects to be postponed.   
  Grinding media sales were down in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to volume decreases.  In addition, foreign currency translation effects negatively affected year-to-date sales in 2016 as compared to 2015, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015.  The volume decreases are primarily related to the continued slowdown in the Australia mining sector. 
  
   38 

Operating income for the segment in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, was higher as a result of higher restructuring expenses incurred of $1.3 million and $3.0 million in 2015 and cost improvements from the restructuring actions in 2015.  In addition, a $5.0 million impairment charge was recorded on the trade name of our access systems (Webforge) business during the third quarter of 2015.  The increase in operating income was partially offset by lower sales prices in the access systems business.  SG A expense decreased due to currency translation effects and a lower fixed cost structure arising from restructuring activities that took place in 2015.   
  Utility Support Structures (Utility) segment 
    In the Utility segment, sales decreased in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared with 2015, due mainly to decreased average selling prices tied to the lower cost of steel and lower international sales volume.   Declining cost of steel during the second half of 2015 and first quarter of 2016 contributed to lower average selling prices for the first three quarters of 2016. A number of our sales contracts contain provisions that tie the sales price to published steel index pricing at the time our customer issues their purchase order. Those decreases were partially offset by improved volumes for the steel businesses in the third quarter of 2016. 
  In North America, sales volumes in tons for steel utility structures were higher in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared with 2015. Concrete sales volumes in tons decreased during the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016. In the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared to 2015, international utility structures sales decreased due to lower volumes primarily in China.     
  Gross profit as a percentage of sales improved in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared to 2015, due to a number of actions taken in 2015 to improve our cost structure in this segment, including certain restructuring activities involving facility closures.  We incurred $0.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of restructuring costs within gross profit in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2015.  SG A expense was lower in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared with 2015, primarily due to the benefits realized from the 2015 restructuring activities. Operating income increased in the first three quarters of 2016, as compared with 2015, primarily due to significantly lower restructuring costs ($0.5 million and $3.6 million of restructuring expense in the first three quarters of 2016 and 2015) and the related improved cost structure realized in 2016.  The sales volume improvement in the third quarter of 2016 provided additional leverage of fixed costs as compared to the same period in 2015 to increase operating income.   
  Coatings segment 
  Coatings segment sales in North America decreased in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared with the same periods in 2015, due to lower volumes and less favorable sales pricing mostly due to mix.  The decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of American Galvanizing that accounted for $2.0 million and $5.9 million of sales, respectively.  Coatings sales in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively flat in the third quarter but decreased in the first three quarters of 2016 primarily due to reduced volumes and unfavorable currency translation effects related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar and Malaysian Ringgit.  Continued weak demand in Australia led to lower volumes and sales volumes in Asia were down in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, due to a slower market environment.  
  SG A expense was lower in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, due to recording an impairment charge in the third quarter of 2015 on the goodwill and trade name associated with the APAC Coatings reporting unit totaling $10.2 million.  In addition, the contingent consideration liability to the former owners of Pure Metal Galvanizing (PMG), payable in calendar 2018, was reduced in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016 by $2.6 million and $3.5 million, respectively, due to changes in the expected earnings over the earn out period.  The decrease was partially offset by the SG A of American Galvanizing, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Operating income was higher in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared with 2015, due primarily to the $10.2 million impairment charges in the third quarter of 2015 not recurring in 2016, the $2.6 million and $3.5 million reduction in the PMG contingent consideration liability in 2016, respectively, and income from the American Galvanizing acquisition.  These increases were partially offset by reduced volumes in North America and Asia Pacific, less favorable sales mix, and certain inefficiencies and higher costs from operational issues in 2016 at a couple of our facilities.        
  Irrigation segment 
  The decrease in Irrigation segment net sales in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared with 2015, was mainly due to sales volume decreases in North America for both the irrigation and tubing businesses and unfavorable currency translation effects for our international irrigation business.  Volume increases for international irrigation partially  
  
   39 

offset the decrease.  Irrigation net sales for the third quarter of 2016 was flat as compared to the same period in 2015.  In fiscal 2016, net farm income in the United States is expected to decrease 11.5% from the levels of 2015, due in part to lower market prices for corn and soybeans. The 2016 estimate represents the third consecutive year of a decrease in estimated net farm income. We believe this reduction contributed to lower demand for irrigation machines in North America in the third quarter and first three quarters of 2016, as compared with 2015.  In international markets, sales volumes increased in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily in Brazil and South Africa. On a year-to-date basis, sales volumes increased in 2016 over 2015 due to volume improvements in Brazil, South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation effects of $10.0 million. 
  SG A was higher in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, as compared with 2015.  The increase can be attributed to higher compensation and incentive expenses due to improved international irrigation operations.  SG A was lower in 2016 on a year-to-date basis, as compared to 2015, due primarily to reduced discretionary spending. Operating income for the segment declined in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 over 2015, due to North America irrigation and tubing sales volume decreases, partially offset by improved international volumes.  
  Other 
  Due to the business reorganization that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015, there are no longer business operations included in Other. 
  Net corporate expense 
  Net corporate expense increased in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015, due to $3.2 million of higher deferred compensation expenses that is offset by an increase of the same amount in other expense, increased incentive expenses due to improved operations, and increased Delta Pension Plan expenses.  In addition, there was $1.6 million of restructuring expenses booked in the third quarter of 2016 that related to exiting a business development activity as part of the 2015 Plan.  These increases were partially offset by restructuring expenses incurred in 2015 and the benefits achieved in 2016 through the 2015 restructuring costs.  Net corporate expense decreased in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, due largely to restructuring activities that took place during 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower headcounts, reduced discretionary spending, and restructuring expenses in 2015 which did not recur in 2016.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash Flows 
  Working Capital and Operating Cash Flows  -Net working capital was   $914.3 million   at   September 24, 2016  , as compared to   $860.3 million   at   December 26, 2015  . The increase in net working capital in   2016   mainly resulted from increased inventory and prepaid expenses, restricted cash, and other assets. Cash flow provided by operations was   $127.3 million   in the first three quarters of   2016  , as compared with   $182.8 million   in first three quarters of   2015  . The decrease in operating cash flow in the first three quarters of 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily the result of higher net working capital that resulted in higher uses of cash.  
  Investing Cash Flows  -Capital spending in the first three quarters of fiscal   2016   was   $42.2 million  , as compared to   $34.4 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Capital spending projects in 2016 and 2015 related to investments in machinery and equipment across all businesses. We expect our capital spending for the 2016 fiscal year to be approximately $65 million. 
  Financing Cash Flows  -Our total interest bearing debt decreased slightly to   $757.3 million   at   September 24, 2016   from   $759.0 million   at   December 26, 2015  . Financing cash flows changed from a use of approximately $190.2 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 to a use of $82.4 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016.  The primary reason for the change was due to purchasing $101.6 million less treasury shares in the first three quarters of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 related to the share repurchase program.   
  Financing and Capital 
  On May 13, 2014, we announced a new capital allocation philosophy which covered a share repurchase program. The Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million of the Company's outstanding common stock from time  
  to time over twelve months at prevailing market prices, through open market or privately-negotiated transactions.  In February 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million of share purchase, without an expiration date.  The share purchases will be funded from available working capital and short-term borrowings and will be made subject to market and economic conditions. We are not obligated to make any share repurchases under the share repurchase program and we may discontinue the share repurchase program at any time.  
  As of   September 24, 2016  , we have acquired approximately 4.5 million shares for approximately $610.6 million under these share repurchase programs. As of   October 20, 2016  , the date as of which we report on the cover of this Form 10-Q the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, we have acquired a total of approximately 4.56 million shares for approximately $614.5 million under these share repurchase programs.    
  Our capital allocation philosophy announcement included our intention to manage our capital structure to maintain our investment grade debt rating.  Our most recent rating were Baa3 by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and BBB+ rating by Standard and Poor's Rating Services.  We would be willing to allow our debt rating to fall to BBB - to finance a special acquisition or other opportunity.  Otherwise, we expect to maintain a ratio of debt to invested capital which will support our current investment grade debt rating.   
    
  Our debt financing at   September 24, 2016   is primarily long-term debt consisting of: 
                
    We are allowed to repurchase the notes at specified prepayment premiums.  All three tranches of these notes are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. 
       
  At   September 24, 2016   and December 26, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that may limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement. At   September 24, 2016  , we had the ability to borrow $584.6 million under this facility, after consideration of standby letters of credit of $15.4 million associated with certain insurance obligations and international sales commitments. We also maintain certain short-term bank lines of credit totaling $118.1 million, $115.1 million of which was unused at   September 24, 2016  .  
    
  Our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreement each contain cross-default provisions which permit the acceleration of our indebtedness to them if we default on other indebtedness that results in, or permits, the acceleration of such other indebtedness. 
  The debt agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities, including capital expenditures. The debt agreements allow us to add estimated EBITDA from acquired businesses for periods we did not own the acquired business. The debt agreements also provide for an adjustment to EBITDA, subject to certain limitations, for non-cash charges or gains that are non-recurring in nature. For 2016, our covenant calculations do not include any estimated EBITDA from acquired businesses.   
  Our key debt covenants are as follows: 
             
    Interest-bearing debt is not to exceed 3.5X Adjusted EBITDA of the prior four quarters; and 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA over the prior four quarters must be at least 2.5X our interest expense over the same period.  

40 

At   September 24, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants related to the debt agreements. The key covenant calculations at   September 24, 2016   were as follows: 

The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA-last four quarters (September 27, 2015 through September 24, 2016) is as follows: 

Our businesses are cyclical, but we have diversity in our markets, from a product, customer and a geographical standpoint. We have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through business cycles and maintain liquidity. We have consistently generated operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures. Based on our available credit facilities, recent issuance of senior unsecured notes and our history of positive operational cash flows, we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs.  
  
   41 

We have not made any provision for U.S. income taxes in our financial statements on approximately $409.3 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as we intend to reinvest those earnings. Of our cash balances of $349.4 million at   September 24, 2016  , approximately $296.0 million is held in entities outside the United States with $66.8 million specifically held within consolidated Delta Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  Delta Ltd. sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and therefore, the Company is allowed to dividend out Delta Ltd.'s available cash only as long as that dividend does not negatively impact Delta Ltd.'s ability to meet its annual contribution requirements of the pension plan.  We believe that the cash payments Delta Ltd. receives from its intercompany notes will provide sufficient funds to meet the pension funding requirements but additional analysis on pension funding requirements would have to be performed prior to the repatriation of the $66.8 million of Delta Ltd.'s cash balances.          
  If we need to repatriate foreign cash balances to the United States to meet our cash needs, income taxes would be paid to the extent that those cash repatriations were undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The income taxes that we would pay if cash were repatriated depends on the amounts to be repatriated and from which country. If all of our cash outside the United States were to be repatriated to the United States, depending on the timing and nature of such repatriations, we estimate that we would pay in the range of $3 million to $104 million in income taxes to repatriate that cash.

  The Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and (2) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.
