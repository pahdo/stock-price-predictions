Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  Some of the statements under "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"). The PSLRA provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to us specifically and the insurance and reinsurance business generally, investments, capital markets and the general economic environments in which we operate. Statements which include the words "expect," "intend," "plan," "believe," "project," "anticipate," "seek," "will," and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature identify forward-looking statements for purposes of the PSLRA or otherwise. 
  All forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following:    
             
    the effects of competitors' pricing policies, and of changes in laws and regulations on competition, industry consolidation and development of competing financial products; 
                
    greater frequency or severity of claims and loss activity, including as a result of natural or man-made catastrophic events or as a result of changing climate conditions, than our underwriting, reserving or investment practices have anticipated; 
                
    changes in market conditions in the agriculture industry, which may vary depending upon demand for agricultural products, weather, commodity prices, natural disasters, technological advances in agricultural practices, changes in U.S. and foreign legislation and policies related to agricultural products and producers; 
                
    termination of or changes in the terms of the U.S. multiple peril crop insurance program and termination or changes to the U.S. farm bill, including modifications to the Standard Reinsurance Agreement put in place by the Risk Management Agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture; 
                
    decreased demand for property and casualty insurance or reinsurance or increased competition due to an increase in capacity of property and casualty insurers and reinsurers; 
                
    changes in the availability, cost or quality of reinsurance or retrocessional coverage; 
                
    the inability to renew business previously underwritten or acquired; 
                
    the inability to obtain or maintain financial strength or claims-paying ratings by one or more of our subsidiaries; 
                
    our ability to effectively integrate acquired operations and to continue to expand our business; 
                
    uncertainties in our reserving process, including the potential for adverse development of our loss reserves or failure of our loss limitation methods; 
                
    the ability of the counterparty institutions with which we conduct business to continue to meet their obligations to us; 
                
    the failure or delay of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund or private market participants in Florida to promptly pay claims, particularly following a large windstorm or of multiple smaller storms; 
                
    our continued ability to comply with applicable financial standards and restrictive covenants, the breach of which could trigger significant collateral or prepayment obligations; 
                
    Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd. ("Endurance Holdings") or Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd. ("Endurance Bermuda") becomes subject to income taxes in jurisdictions outside of Bermuda; 
                
    changes in tax regulations or laws applicable to us, our subsidiaries, brokers or customers; 
                
    state, federal and foreign regulations that impede our ability to charge adequate rates and efficiently allocate capital; 
                
    changes in insurance regulations in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in which we operate, including the implementation of Solvency II by the European Commission; 
                
    the impact of the United Kingdom's June 2016 referendum on European Union membership and the potential withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union; 
                
    reduced acceptance of our existing or new products and services;

     Table of Contents  

loss of business provided by any one of a few brokers on whom we depend for a large portion of our revenue, and our exposure to the credit risk of our brokers; 
                
    actions by our competitors, many of which are larger or have greater financial resources than we do; 
                
    assessments by states for high risk or otherwise uninsured individuals;

    political stability of Bermuda or other countries in which we operate; 
                
    changes in the political environment of certain countries in which we operate or underwrite business; 
                
    changes in accounting regulation, policies or practices; 
                
    our investment performance; 
                
    the valuation of our invested assets and the determination of impairments of those assets, if any; 
                
    the breach of our investment guidelines or the inability of those guidelines to mitigate investment risk; 
                
    the need for additional capital in the future which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms; 
                
    the ability to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated event;  
                
    changes in general economic conditions and/or industry specific conditions, including inflation or deflation, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and other factors; and 
                
    the failure of Sompo Holdings, Inc. to complete the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. 
     The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in Endurance Holdings' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors thereof and hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

           2. 
    Summary of significant accounting policies 
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Endurance Holdings, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and BCRH and the BCGR Cell. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Among other matters, significant estimates and assumptions are used to record premiums written and ceded, to record the fair value of investments and to record reserves for losses and loss expenses and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are recorded in the consolidated financial statements in the period that they are determined to be necessary. 
  The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contained in Endurance Holdings' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (the "  2015   Form 10-K"). 
  Certain comparative information has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 
  There were no material changes in the Company's significant accounting and reporting policies subsequent to the filing of the   2015   Form 10-K with the exception of the additions to the Company's accounting policies described below relating to the Company's investment repurchase agreements in the current quarter.  
  (a)   Investments 
  The Company has entered into investment repurchase agreements, whereby the Company sells securities and repurchases them at a future date for a predetermined price. These investment repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings and are recorded at the contractual repurchase price plus accrued interest. The securities to be repurchased are the same, or substantially the same, as those sold. The fair value of the underlying securities is included in securities pledged under repurchase agreements in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The use of the cash received by the Company from the counterparty pursuant to the repurchase agreement is not restricted.

2. 
    Summary of significant accounting policies, cont'd. 
     (a)   Investments, cont'd. 
  The obligation to return the cash is included in payable under repurchase agreements in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In these repurchase transactions, the securities sold by the Company (pledged collateral) may be sold or repledged by the counterparties with whom the repurchase agreement is executed. 
  (b)   Recent accounting pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 provides comprehensive guidance on the recognition of revenue from customers arising from the transfer of goods and services. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for these goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also provides guidance on accounting for certain contract costs and will also require new disclosures. ASU 2014-09 was to be effective for public business entities in annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, however, in July 2015, the FASB decided to defer by one year the effective dates of ASU 2014-09, and as a result, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for public business entities in annual and interim period beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis" ("ASU 2015-02"). Under ASU 2015-02, all legal entities are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 set forth amendments: (1) modifying the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities; (2) eliminating the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; (3) affecting the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and (4) providing a scope exception from consolidation guidance for certain reporting entities. ASU 2015-02 became effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 effective January 1, 2016 and it did not have a material impact on the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments" ("ASU 2015-16"). ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment. ASU 2015-16 became effective for public business entities in interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2015-16 effective January 1, 2016 and it did not have a material impact on the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("ASU 2016-01"). ASU 2016-01 requires entities to measure certain equity investments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for a practicability exception. For financial liabilities measured using the fair value option, entities will need to present any change in fair value caused by a change in instrument-specific credit risk separately in other comprehensive income. ASU 2016-01 also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-01 is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted, except for certain provisions. ASU 2016-01 should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Summary of significant accounting policies, cont'd. 
     (b)   Recent accounting pronouncements, cont'd. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases" ("ASU 2016-02"). The objective of ASU 2016-02 is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 must be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Entities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The guidance also changes employers' accounting for an employee's use of shares to satisfy the employer's statutory income tax withholding obligation, and accounting for forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 will change how companies measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren't measured at fair value through net income. The standard will replace today's "incurred loss" approach with an "expected loss" model for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount, as they do today under the other-than-temporary impairment model. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Investments, cont'd. 
     Contractual maturities of the Company's fixed maturity and short-term investments are shown below as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

The following table summarizes the fair value of the fixed maturity investments, short-term investments and equity securities classified as trading at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

In addition to the Company's fixed maturity, short-term and equity securities, the Company invests in alternative funds and specialty funds.

     The following table summarizes the composition, unfunded commitments and redemption restrictions of other investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Hedge funds   The redemption frequency of the hedge funds in which the Company invests range from monthly to biennially with notice periods from   30   to   180   days. Over   one   year, it is estimated that the Company can liquidate approximately   83.1%   of its hedge fund portfolio, with the remainder over the following   two   years. 
  Private investment funds   The Company generally has no right to redeem its interest in any private investment fund in advance of dissolution of the applicable partnership. Instead, the nature of these investments is that distributions are received by the Company in connection with the liquidation of or distribution of earnings from the underlying assets of the applicable limited partnership. It is estimated that the majority of the underlying assets of the limited partnerships would liquidate over   5   to   10   years from inception of the limited partnership. A secondary market, with unpredictable liquidity, exists for limited partner interests in private equity funds.   
  Other investment funds   Other investment funds includes funds on deposit with Lloyd's of London ("Lloyd's"), which are restricted, and the Company's investment in BCGR, which represents the net asset or liability of the Company's investment in BCGR that has not been deployed into the BCGR cell. 
  High yield loan funds   There are generally no restrictions on the Company's right to redeem its interest in high yield loan funds with the exception of certain redemption frequency and notice requirements. The redemption frequency of these funds is monthly with notice periods from   30   to   60   days.

    Investments, cont'd. 
     The decrease in gross unrealized losses on the Company's available for sale fixed income investments at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the remaining fixed income investments in an unrealized loss position and determined that it was unlikely that the Company would be required to sell those securities in an unrealized loss position. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company impaired certain equity securities that were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve consecutive months.  The Company recognized in earnings total other-than-temporary impairments of   $0.2 million   and   $10.6 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Other Investments 
  The Company is involved in the normal course of business with VIEs as a passive investor in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and through its interests in various other investments that are structured as limited partnerships considered to be third party VIEs. The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of an entity subject to consolidation based on a qualitative assessment of the VIE's capital structure, contractual terms, nature of the VIE's operations and purpose and the Company's relative exposure to the related risks of the VIE on the date it becomes initially involved in the VIE. The Company reassesses its VIE determination with respect to an entity on an ongoing basis. The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary for any of these investments as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company believes its exposure to loss with respect to these investments is generally limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and any unfunded investment commitments. 
  Collateralized Reinsurance Entities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Endurance Holdings and Endurance Bermuda together owned   33.3%   of BCRH's common shares. BCRH is considered a VIE under U.S. GAAP due to service agreements for investment management, underwriting and insurance management and administrative services between BCRH and BCML, and the economic penalty to terminate the service agreements by BCRH. The Company has determined that it is BCRH's primary beneficiary due to its ability to direct the activities of BCRH through BCML along with its economic interest in BCRH. As a result, the Company fully consolidates the assets, liabilities and operations of BCRH and its subsidiaries within its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The interests in BCRH and its subsidiaries that the Company fully consolidates that are attributable to third-party investors are reported within the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as non-controlling interests. BCRH's shareholder rights do not include redemption features within the control of the third party shareholders. The Company reassesses its VIE determination with respect to BCRH on an ongoing basis.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Endurance Bermuda owned   25.2%   of BCGR's ordinary shares. BCGR is considered a "voting interest entity" under U.S. GAAP and, because the Company owns less than   50%   of its outstanding ordinary shares, the Company does not consolidate BCGR's assets, liabilities or operations within its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  However, the BCGR Cell and Blue Water Re Ltd. ("Blue Water Re"), the Company's wholly-owned Bermuda-based special purpose insurance vehicle, are considered VIEs under U.S. GAAP due to service agreements for investment management, underwriting and insurance management and administrative services between Blue Water Re and BCML. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of these entities due to its ability to direct the activities of Blue Water Re and the BCGR Cell along with its economic interest in these entities. Therefore, as funds held in BCGR are invested in the BCGR Cell, and ultimately into Blue Water Re, they are included in the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Conversely, as funds previously invested by BCGR and the BCGR Cell into Blue Water Re are returned to BCGR, they are no longer included in the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The interests in the BCGR Cell and Blue Water Re that the Company fully consolidates that are attributable to third-party investors are reported within the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as non-controlling interests. BCGR's shareholder rights do not include redemption features within the control of the third party shareholders. The Company reassesses its VIE determinations with respect to the BCGR Cell and Blue Water Re on an ongoing basis.

    Fair value measurement 
     The Company determines the fair value of its fixed maturity investments, short-term investments, equity securities, debt, and other assets and liabilities in accordance with current accounting guidance, which defines fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy based on inputs to the various valuation techniques used for each fair value measurement. The Company determines the estimated fair value of each individual security utilizing the highest level inputs available. Valuation inputs by security type may include the following: 
             
    Government and agencies fixed maturity securities   These securities are generally priced by pricing services or index providers. The pricing services or index providers may use current market trades for securities with similar quality, maturity and coupon. If no such trades are available, the pricing service typically uses analytical models which may incorporate option adjusted spreads, daily interest rate data and market/sector news. The Company generally classifies the fair values of government and agencies securities in Level 2. Current issue U.S. government securities are generally valued based on Level 1 inputs, which use the market approach valuation technique. 
                
    Government guaranteed corporate fixed maturity securities   These securities are generally priced by pricing services or index providers. The pricing service or index providers may use current market trades for securities with similar quality, maturity and coupon. If no such trades are available, the pricing service typically uses analytical spread models which may incorporate inputs from the U.S. treasury curve or LIBOR. The Company generally classifies the fair values of its government guaranteed corporate securities in Level 2. 
                
    Corporate fixed maturity securities   These securities are generally priced by pricing services or index providers. The pricing services or index providers typically use discounted cash flow models that incorporate benchmark curves for treasury, swap and high issuance credits. Credit spreads are developed from current market observations for like or similar securities. The Company generally classifies the fair values of its corporate securities in Level 2. The Company uses models that include unobservable inputs to price its corporate bank loan portfolio. As such, the fair values of the corporate bank loans are generally classified in Level 3. 
                
    Equity securities   These securities are generally priced by pricing services or index providers. Depending on the type of underlying equity security or equity fund, the securities are priced by pricing services or index providers based on quoted market prices in active markets or through a discounted cash flow model that incorporates benchmark curves for treasury, swap and credits for like or similar securities. The Company generally classifies the fair values of its equity securities in Level 1 or 2.

    Fair value measurement, cont'd. 
                
    Structured securities including agency and non-agency, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and collateralized loan and debt obligations   These securities are generally priced by broker/dealers. Broker/dealers may use current market trades for securities with similar qualities. If no such trades are available, inputs such as bid and offer, prepayment speeds, the U.S. treasury curve, swap curve and cash settlement may be used in a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of a security. The Company generally classifies the fair values of its structured securities in Level 2. 
                
    Securities pledged under repurchase agreements - These securities have been sold under a repurchase agreement and consist of U.S. government and agencies and residential mortgage-backed securities.  Please refer to the pricing methods used for these types of securities.   
                
    Other assets and liabilities   A portion of other assets and liabilities are composed of a variety of derivative instruments used to enhance the efficiency of the investment portfolio and economically hedge certain risks. These instruments are generally priced by pricing services, broker/dealers and/or recent trading activity. The market value approach valuation technique is used to estimate the fair value for these derivatives based on significant observable market inputs. Certain derivative instruments are priced by pricing services based on quoted market prices in active markets. These derivative instruments are generally classified in Level 1. Other derivative instruments are priced using industry valuation models and are considered Level 2, as the inputs to the valuation model are based on observable market inputs. Also included in this line item are proprietary, non-exchange traded derivative-based risk management products primarily used to address weather and energy risks. The trading market for these weather and energy derivatives are generally linked to energy and agriculture commodities, weather and other natural phenomena. In instances where market prices are not available, the Company uses industry or internally developed valuation techniques such as spread option, Black Scholes, quanto and simulation modeling to determine fair value and classifies these in Level 3. These models may reference prices for similar instruments. 
                
    Debt   Outstanding debt consists of the Company's 7.0% Senior Notes due July 15, 2034, the 4.7% Senior Notes due October 15, 2022 (together, the "Senior Notes") and the Trust Preferred Securities. The fair values of the Senior Notes were obtained from a third party pricing service and pricing was based on the spread above the risk-free yield curve. The fair values of the Trust Preferred Securities were based on the spread above the risk-free yield curve. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and broker-dealer quotes. As these spreads and the yields for the risk-free yield curve are observable market inputs, the fair values of the Senior Notes and the Trust Preferred Securities are classified in Level 2. 
     The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income, other investments, net receivable on sales of investments, net payable on purchases of investments, payable under repurchase agreements, the amount outstanding under the BCRH Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 10) and other financial instruments not described above approximated their fair values at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  . 
  Transfers between levels are assumed to occur at the end of each period.

Level 3 securities are primarily comprised of corporate securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan and debt obligations, and weather derivatives. There were no material changes in the Company's valuation techniques for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

    Fair value measurement, cont'd. 
     Other assets and other liabilities measured at fair value and classified as Level 3 at   September 30, 2016   include assets of   $32.6 million   (December 31,   2015   -   $41.5 million  ) and liabilities of   $27.9 million   (December 31,   2015   -   $42.0 million  ) related to proprietary, non-exchange traded derivative-based risk management products used in the Company's weather risk management business, and hedging and trading activities related to these risks. In instances where market prices are not available, the Company may use industry or internally developed valuation techniques such as historical analysis and simulation modeling to determine fair value and are considered Level 3. 
  Observable and unobservable inputs to these valuation techniques vary by contract requirements and commodity type, are validated using market-based or independently sourced parameters where applicable and may typically include the following: 
     Observable inputs: contract price, notional, option strike, term to expiry, contractual limits, 
  temperature, rainfall, windspeed, wave height, snow fall, cyclone category; 
     Unobservable inputs: correlation, composite weather variable; and 
     Both observable and unobservable: forward commodity price. 
  The Company's weather curves are determined by taking the average payouts for each transaction within its portfolio utilizing de-trended historical weather measurements. The Company's commodity curves are determined using historical market data scaled to currently observed market prices. The range of each unobservable input could vary based on the specific commodity, including, but not limited to natural gas, electricity, crude, liquids, temperature or precipitation. Due to the diversity of the portfolio, the range of unobservable inputs could be wide-spread as reflected in the below table on quantitative information. 
  If a trade has one or more significant valuation inputs that are unobservable, such trades are initially valued at the transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the initial valuation, the Company updates market observable inputs to reflect observable market changes. The unobservable inputs are validated at each reporting period and are only changed when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data. 
  Changes in any or all of the unobservable inputs listed above may contribute positively or negatively to the overall portfolio fair value depending upon the underlying position. In general, movements in weather curves are the largest contributing factor that impacts fair value.

5.       Earnings per share 
  The two-class method utilized by the Company is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for the holders of Endurance Holdings' ordinary shares (also referred to as "common shares") and participating common shares, which includes unvested restricted shares and restricted share units that receive cash dividends, according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Net income available to Endurance Holdings common and participating common shareholders is reduced by the amount of dividends declared in the current period and by the contractual amount of dividends that must be paid for the current period related to the Company's common and participating common shares. Any remaining undistributed earnings are allocated to the common and participating common shareholders to the extent that each security may share in earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. In periods of loss, no losses are allocated to participating common shareholders. Instead, all such losses are allocated solely to the common shareholders. 
  Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The weighted average number of common shares excludes any dilutive effect of outstanding options and convertible securities such as unvested restricted shares and restricted share units. 
  Diluted earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of common shares and assumes the exercise of all dilutive stock options and the vesting or conversion of all convertible securities such as unvested restricted shares using the two-class method described above. 
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Represents earnings attributable to holders of unvested restricted shares and restricted share units issued under the Company's equity compensation plan that are considered participating. In periods of loss, no losses are allocated to participating common shareholders (unvested restricted shares and restricted share units).

    Derivatives 
     The Company regularly transacts in certain derivative-based weather risk management products primarily to address weather and energy risks on behalf of third parties. The markets for these derivatives are generally linked to energy and agriculture commodities, weather and other natural phenomena. Generally, the Company's current portfolio of such derivative contracts is of short duration and such contracts are predominantly seasonal in nature. The Company also invests a portion of its investments with third party investment managers with investment guidelines that permit the use of derivative instruments. The Company may enter derivative transactions directly or as part of strategies employed by its external investment managers. 
  The Company's derivative instruments are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, with changes in fair value and gains and losses recognized in net realized and unrealized gains, net foreign exchange (gains) losses and other underwriting (loss) income in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 
  The Company's derivatives are not designated as hedges under current accounting guidance. 
  The Company's objectives for holding these derivatives are as follows: 
  Interest Rate Futures, Swaps, Swaptions and Options   - to manage exposure to interest rate risk, which can include increasing or decreasing its exposure to this risk through modification of the portfolio composition and duration. 
  Industry Loss Warranty ("ILW") Swaps   - to manage underwriting risk. The Company has entered into ILW swap contracts which provide reinsurance-like protection to the Company for specific loss events associated with certain lines of its business. The Company has also sold ILW protection, which provides reinsurance-like protection to third parties for specific loss events.  
  Foreign Exchange Forwards, Futures and Options   - as part of overall currency risk management and investment strategies. 
  Credit Default Swaps   - to manage market exposures. The Company may assume or economically hedge credit risk through credit default swaps to replicate or hedge investment positions. The original term of these credit default swaps is generally   five   years or less. 
  To-Be-Announced Mortgage-backed Securities ("TBAs")   - to enhance investment performance and as part of overall investment strategy. TBAs represent commitments to purchase or sell a future issuance of agency mortgage-backed securities. For the period between purchase of a TBA and issuance of the underlying securities, the Company s position is accounted for as a derivative. 
  Energy and Weather Contracts     to address weather and energy risks. The Company may purchase or sell contracts with financial settlements based on the performance of an index linked to a quantifiable weather element, such as temperature, precipitation, snowfall or windspeed, and structures with multiple risk triggers indexed to a quantifiable weather element and a weather sensitive commodity price, such as temperature and electrical power or natural gas. Generally, the Company's current portfolio of energy and weather derivative contracts is of comparably short duration and such contracts are predominantly seasonal in nature. 
  LIBOR Swap     to establish future net cash flows in connection with the Trust Preferred Securities for the   five  -year period beginning March 30, 2012 as if these securities bore interest at a fixed rate of   4.905%  .  
  Loss Development Cover     as part of the sale of Montpelier U.S. Insurance Company ("MUSIC") to Selective Insurance Group, Inc. ("Selective"), Montpelier Reinsurance Ltd. (now Endurance Bermuda) entered into a loss development cover with MUSIC which ensures that MUSIC's reserve for losses and loss expenses relating to retained business written on or prior to December 31, 2011 remains adequate. Under the loss development cover, any future adverse development associated with such retained reserves will be protected by Endurance Bermuda and any future favorable development associated with such retained reserves will benefit Endurance Bermuda.

Interest rate futures are not subject to master netting agreements. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's derivative instruments were recorded on a gross basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   no   reverse repurchase agreements. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company held   $30.0 million   reverse repurchase agreements.

           9.  
    Segment reporting 
     The determination of the Company's business segments is based on how the Company monitors the performance of its underwriting operations. The Company has two reportable business segments, Insurance and Reinsurance, which are comprised of the following lines of business: 
  Insurance segment lines of business    
     Agriculture 
     Casualty and other specialty 
     Professional lines 
     Property, marine/energy and aviation 
  Reinsurance segment lines of business    
     Catastrophe 
     Property 
     Casualty 
     Professional lines 
     Specialty 
  Management measures Insurance and Reinsurance segment results on the basis of the combined ratio, which is obtained by dividing the sum of the net losses and loss expenses, acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned. When purchased within a single line of business, ceded reinsurance and recoveries are accounted for within that line of business. When purchased across multiple lines of business, ceded reinsurance and recoveries are allocated to the lines of business in proportion to the related risks assumed. The Company does not manage its assets by segment; accordingly, investment income and total assets are not allocated to the individual business segments. General and administrative expenses incurred by the segments are allocated directly. Remaining general and administrative expenses not incurred by the segments are classified as corporate expenses and are not allocated to the individual business segments. Ceded reinsurance and recoveries are recorded within the business segment to which they apply.

  Credit Facility 
  On March 23, 2016, the Company and certain designated subsidiaries of the Company entered into a   $450.0 million     five  -year letter of credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan") as administrative agent (the "Credit Facility"). Upon entering into the Credit Facility, the Company terminated its existing   $700.0 million   credit agreement, dated April 19, 2012, with JPMorgan as administrative agent. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility of   $255.3 million   (  December 31, 2015       $329.9 million  ). The Credit Facility does not provide for revolving or term loans. 
  The Credit Facility is collateralized on a several basis by each entity incurring such obligation by cash and securities deposited into collateral accounts from time to time with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as collateral agent. So long as there is no default under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company may request that the size of the Credit Facility be increased by   $100.0 million  , but no participating lender is obligated to increase its commitments under the Credit Facility.  
  The Company is required to pay a fee of   0.40%   per annum on the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the Company to pay to the lenders a commitment fee in the amount of   0.125%   per annum on the average daily amount of the unused commitments of the lenders. The Credit Facility permits a lender, if requested and in its discretion, to issue a letter of credit pursuant to which it fronts for the other lenders. For such letters of credit, such fronting lenders may receive certain fronting fees from the Company.  
  The Credit Facility requires the Company's compliance with certain customary restrictive covenants, including a financial covenant that the Company maintain a leverage ratio of no greater than   0.35  :1.00 at any time. In addition, each of the Company's regulated insurance subsidiaries that has a claims paying rating from A.M. Best must maintain a rating of at least B++ at all times.  
  The Credit Facility also contains customary event of default provisions, including failure to pay any unpaid drawing under a letter of credit under the Credit Facility or interest thereon and failure to pay any fee under the Credit Facility, insolvency events of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries), a change in control of the Company, a breach of the representations or covenants in the Credit Facility or the security documents relating thereto and certain defaults by the Company or its subsidiaries under other indebtedness. In the case of an event of default that occurs as a result of an insolvency event of the Company or one of its designated subsidiary borrowers, the commitments of the lenders will automatically terminate and the repayment of outstanding obligations will be automatically accelerated. Upon the occurrence of any other event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders can terminate their commitments under the Credit Facility, require repayment of any outstanding obligations under the Credit Facility, give notice of non-extension of any outstanding letters of credit in accordance with their terms, require the delivery of cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit and foreclose on any collateral held by the lenders (or any agent on their behalf) under the Credit Facility.

The Company expects to incur additional costs and expenses associated with the Merger during the fourth quarter of   2016   and the first quarter of 2017. 
  Hurricane Matthew 
  On October 7 and 8, 2016, Hurricane Matthew affected the southeastern coast of the United States, ultimately making landfall in South Carolina. To date, reported claims as a result of this storm have been limited. While losses emanating from the storm cannot be accurately estimated at this time, the Company may need to establish appropriate loss reserves related to Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter of 2016, which may have a negative impact on its results of operations.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd. ("Endurance Holdings") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Form 10-Q") as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , the discussions of critical accounting policies and the qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk contained in Endurance Holdings' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (the "  2015   Form 10-K").  
  Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, including information with respect to the Company's plans and strategy for its business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Please see the section "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by any forward-looking statements contained in this discussion and analysis. You should review the "Risk Factors" set forth in the   2015   Form 10-K and this Form 10-Q for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein. 
  Overview 
  Endurance Holdings was organized as a Bermuda holding company on June 27, 2002 and writes specialty lines of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance on a global basis through its operating subsidiaries. The Company seeks to create a portfolio of specialty lines of business that are profitable and have limited correlation with one another. The Company's portfolio of specialty lines of business is organized into two business segments, Insurance and Reinsurance.     
  In the Insurance segment, the Company writes agriculture, casualty and other specialty, professional lines, and property, marine/energy and aviation insurance. In the Reinsurance segment, the Company writes catastrophe, property, casualty, professional lines and specialty reinsurance. 
  The Company's Insurance and Reinsurance segments both include property related coverages, which provide insurance or reinsurance of an insurable interest in tangible property for property loss, damage or loss of use. In addition, the Company's Insurance and Reinsurance segments include various casualty insurance and reinsurance coverages, which are primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third parties, i.e., not the insured, or to property owned by third parties and the legal liability imposed on the insured resulting from such injuries.          
  As part of its collateralized reinsurance and third party asset management operations, Endurance Holdings and Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd. ("Endurance Bermuda") together own   33.3%   of Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Ltd. ("BCRH"), and Endurance Bermuda owns   25.2%   of Blue Capital Global Reinsurance Fund Limited ("BCGR").  
  BCRH is a Bermuda-based exempted limited liability holding company managed by a subsidiary of the Company. BCRH provides fully-collateralized property catastrophe reinsurance and invests in various insurance-linked securities through its wholly-owned Bermuda-based subsidiaries, Blue Capital Re. Ltd. and Blue Capital Re ILS Ltd. Blue Capital Re Ltd. is a Class 3A insurer licensed under the Bermuda Insurance Act. BCRH's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Bermuda Stock Exchange.  
  BCGR is a closed-ended mutual fund incorporated in Bermuda and managed by a subsidiary of the Company.  BCGR serves as the feeder fund for the Blue Capital Global Reinsurance SA-I cell.  BCGR's shares are listed on the Specialist Fund Market of the London Stock Exchange and on the Bermuda Stock Exchange.  
  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates 
  The Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the selection of accounting policies and application of significant accounting estimates which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that some of the more critical judgments in the areas of accounting estimates and assumptions that affect its financial condition and results of operations are related to the recognition of premiums written and ceded, reserves for losses and loss expenses, other-than-temporary impairments within the investment portfolio and fair value measurements of certain portions of the investment portfolio. There were no material changes in the application of the Company's critical accounting estimates. Management has discussed the application of these critical accounting estimates with the Company's Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. For a detailed discussion of the Company's critical accounting estimates, please refer to the   2015   Form 10-K and the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.

Premiums 
  Gross premiums written in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $760.7 million  , an increase of   $118.1 million  , or   18.4%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . Net premiums written in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $349.0 million  , an increase of   $12.3 million  , or   3.7%   compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase in gross premiums written were driven by the following factors: 
             
    An increase in the property, marine/energy and aviation, professional lines and casualty and other specialty lines of business in the Insurance segment due primarily to business generated by new underwriting teams  in the U.S. and the U.K. and new business resulting from the acquisition of Montpelier Re Holdings Ltd. ("Montpelier");  
                
    A decline in the agriculture line of business in the Insurance segment due to lower commodity prices; 
                
    An increase in the catastrophe line of business in the Reinsurance segment due to new business resulting from the acquisition of Montpelier, partially offset by non-renewal of policies that no longer met profitability targets and declines in signed lines; 
                
    An increase in the specialty line of business in the Reinsurance segment due to new business written and increased renewals, partially offset by non-renewal of policies that no longer met profitability targets;  
                
    A decline in the property line of business in the Reinsurance segment due to non-renewal of a large contract and declines in signed lines; and 
                
    A decline in the casualty line of business in the Reinsurance segment due to the timing of renewals for certain multi-year deals, partially offset by new business. 
     Ceded premiums written increased   34.6%   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . In the Insurance segment, increased gross premiums written resulted in increased ceded premiums under the whole account quota share treaty covering the entire Insurance segment's business, combined with additional purchases of quota share and excess of loss reinsurance coverage. In the Reinsurance segment, ceded premiums written increased due to additional excess of loss retrocessional coverage purchased on the catastrophe line of business, quota share coverage on the specialty line of business, and growth in gross written premiums ceded under existing quota share treaties. 
  Net premiums earned for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $610.2 million  , an increase of   $53.2 million  , or   9.5%  , from the   third   quarter of   2015   due to the increase in gross premiums written and the earning of premiums acquired, partially offset by increased ceded premiums. 
  Net Investment Income 
  The Company's net investment income of   $62.2 million   increased by   276.4%  , or   $45.7 million  , for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . This increase resulted primarily from the Company's other investments, which is comprised of alternative funds and specialty funds. Net investment income during the   third   quarter of   2016   included net mark to market gains of   $22.8 million   on other investments as compared to mark to market losses of   $17.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Investment expenses, including investment management fees, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $3.9 million   compared to   $4.2 million   for the same period in   2015  .     
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , the yield on the benchmark three year U.S. Treasury bond fluctuated within a   31   basis point range, with a high of   0.96%   and a low of   0.65%  . Trading activity in the Company's trading and available for sale portfolios during the   third   quarter included reductions in government guaranteed corporate securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, equity securities, and short-term investments and increased allocations to corporate securities and foreign government securities. The duration of fixed income investments decreased to   2.66 years   at   September 30, 2016   from   2.74 years   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains 
  The Company's investment portfolio is actively managed to generate attractive economic returns and income. Movements in financial markets and interest rates influence the timing and recognition of net realized investment gains and losses as the portfolio is adjusted and rebalanced. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments classified as trading and available for sale during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1,393.1 million   compared to   $1,507.9 million   during the same period a year ago. Net realized and unrealized gains increased during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to a reduction in realized losses incurred in the current period compared to the prior period which included losses due to the repositioning the Company's portfolio of equity securities and increased net unrealized gains on trading securities from mark to market adjustments recorded in the current period.

     Table of Contents  

Gross realized investment gains and losses, net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities and the change in the fair value of investment-related derivative financial instruments for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Net Foreign Exchange (Gains) Losses 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company re-measured its monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which resulted in a net foreign exchange gain of   $18.6 million   compared to a net foreign exchange loss of   $8.6 million   for the same period of   2015  . The current period net foreign exchange gain resulted from the British Sterling weakening against the U.S. dollar and other key currencies during the period resulting in the upward revaluation of net asset positions in those currencies. In the prior year, the net foreign exchange loss resulted partly from sales of invested assets that yielded realized foreign exchange losses recognized in net income, which had previously been recognized as unrealized foreign exchange losses in other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign exchange losses in the prior period also resulted from the impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening against British Sterling and the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollar as applied against the Company's net exposures. 
  Net Losses and Loss Expenses 
  The Company's net loss ratio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased compared to the same period in   2015   due primarily to an increase in the current accident year loss ratio in the Insurance segment in the current quarter, which reflected increased attritional and large losses primarily in the property, marine/energy and aviation line of business. 
           The following table shows the net losses after adjustment for reinstatement premiums recorded by the Company in connection with current calendar year catastrophes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   

  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , natural catastrophe related losses added   0.9   percentage points to the Company's net loss ratio after adjustment for reinstatement premiums compared to   3.9   percentage points in the same period for   2015  . 
  Favorable prior year loss reserve development was   $54.3 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , which decreased the net loss ratio by   8.9   percentage points, compared to   $67.3 million   during the same period in   2015  , which decreased the net loss ratio by   12.1   percentage points. In the   third   quarter of   2016  , prior year loss reserves emerged favorably across the agriculture, casualty and other specialty, and property, marine/energy and aviation lines of business in the Insurance segment, and all lines of business in the Reinsurance segment. 
  The Company participates in lines of business where claims may not be reported for many years. Accordingly, management does not believe that reported claims are the only valid means for estimating ultimate obligations. Ultimate losses and loss expenses may differ materially from the amounts recorded in the Company's unaudited consolidated

financial statements. These estimates are reviewed regularly and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the reserves are adjusted as necessary. Reserve adjustments, if any, are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined. The overall loss reserves were established by the Company's actuaries and reflect management's best estimate of ultimate losses. See "Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses" below for further discussion. 
  Acquisition Expenses 
  The acquisition expense ratio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was higher than the same period in   2015   primarily due to the addition of earned premiums in 2015 resulting from the Company's acquisition of Montpelier, which had no associated acquisition costs as these were written off upon the closing of the acquisition in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.  
  General and Administrative Expenses and Corporate Expenses 
  The Company's general and administrative expense ratio for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased by   11.2   percentage points compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to transaction and integration costs associated with the Company's acquisition of Montpelier which were included in corporate expenses in 2015. Excluding transaction and integration costs related to Montpelier, general and administrative and corporate expenses increased for the current quarter compared to the same period in 2015 due to an increase in personnel costs associated with the addition of new underwriting teams and additional employees, partially offset by increased ceding commission reimbursements as a result of increased ceded premiums. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a total of   1,228   employees compared to   1,173   employees at   September 30, 2015  . 
  Amortization of Intangible Assets 
  The Company's amortization of intangibles for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased by   $9.8 million   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to   $293.2 million   of intangible assets recognized in the purchase of Montpelier that are being amortized over their related useful lives. 
  Income Tax (Benefit) Expense  
  The Company recorded an income tax benefit for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of   $0.2 million   compared to income tax expense of   $2.4 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . The income tax benefit in   2016   resulted from changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance recorded at the Company's subsidiaries located in United States taxable jurisdictions. 
  Net Income 
  The Company generated net income of   $139.4 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to net income of   $54.5 million   in the same period of   2015  . The increase in net income in the current period primarily resulted from increased net premiums earned, increased net investment income, increased net foreign exchange gains, and decreased corporate expenses, partially offset by increased net losses and loss expenses, acquisition expenses, and amortization expense.  
  Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests 
  The Company's net income attributable to non-controlling interests was   $5.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.7 million   in the same period of   2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , Endurance Holdings and Endurance Bermuda together owned   33.3%   of BCRH's common shares and Endurance Bermuda owned   25.2%   of BCGR's ordinary shares. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests relates to the share of the Company's net income attributable to the BCRH common shares and BCGR ordinary shares that are not owned by the Company.

     Premiums 
  Gross premiums written in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $3,509.3 million  , an increase of   $704.1 million  , or   25.1%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . Net premiums written in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $2,005.6 million  , an increase of   $344.9 million  , or   20.8%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase in gross premiums written were driven by the following factors:    
             
    An increase in the property, marine/energy and aviation, professional lines and casualty and other specialty lines of business in the Insurance segment due primarily to business generated by new underwriting teams in the U.S. and the U.K. and new business resulting from the acquisition of Montpelier; 
                
    A decline in the agriculture line of business in the Insurance segment due to lower commodity prices;

     Table of Contents  

An increase in the catastrophe line of business in the Reinsurance segment due to new business resulting from the acquisition of Montpelier, partially offset by non-renewal of policies that no longer met profitability targets and declines in renewal rates; 
                
    An increase in the casualty line of business in the Reinsurance segment due to new business written in the U.S. and the U.K. and new business resulting from the acquisition of Montpelier, partially offset by non-renewal of policies that no longer met profitability targets;  
                
    An increase in the property line of business in the Reinsurance segment due to new business resulting from the acquisition of Montpelier, partially offset by the non-renewal of a large contract and declines in signed lines; and  
                
    An increase in the specialty line of business in the Reinsurance segment due to new business written and increased renewals, partially offset by non-renewal of policies that no longer met profitability targets. 
     Ceded premiums written increased during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . In the Insurance segment, increased gross premiums written resulted in increased ceded premiums under the whole account quota share treaty covering the entire Insurance segment's business, combined with additional purchases of facultative and excess of loss reinsurance in the property, marine/energy and aviation line of business. In the Reinsurance segment, ceded premiums written increased due to increased purchases of aggregate excess of loss retrocessional protection within the catastrophe line of business, and additional quota share and excess of loss retrocessional coverage purchased on the specialty line of business. 
  Net premiums earned for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1,763.0 million  , an increase of   $358.0 million  , or   25.5%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   principally due to the increase in gross premiums written and earning of premiums acquired, partially offset by increased ceded premiums. 
  Net Investment Income 
  The Company's net investment income of   $117.4 million   increased by   29.5%  , or   $26.7 million  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . This increase resulted primarily from income generated by the Company's equity securities and fixed income investments, which consist of fixed maturity and short-term investments, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Net investment income during the first   nine   months of   2016   included net mark to market losses of   $0.2 million   on other investments, comprised of alternative funds and specialty funds, as compared to mark to market losses of   $1.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . Investment expenses, including investment management fees, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $11.6 million   compared to   $11.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the yield on the benchmark three year U.S. Treasury bond fluctuated within a   65   basis point range, with a high of   1.30%   and a low of   0.65%  . Trading activity in the Company's trading and available for sale portfolios for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included reductions in short-term investments, commercial mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agencies securities, asset-backed securities, equity securities, collateralized obligations, and government and agency guaranteed corporate securities, and increased allocations to corporate securities, foreign government securities, and residential mortgage-backed securities. 
  Net Realized and Unrealized Gains 
  The Company's investment portfolio is actively managed on a fair value basis to generate attractive economic returns and income. Movements in financial markets and interest rates influence the timing and recognition of net realized investment gains and losses as the portfolio is adjusted and rebalanced. Proceeds from sales of investments classified as trading and available for sale during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $5,210.2 million   compared to   $4,304.6 million   during the same period a year ago. Net realized investment gains during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were consistent with the same period in   2015   due to increased realized losses incurred due to the repositioning the Company's portfolio of equity securities in the current period, offset by increased net unrealized gains on trading securities in the current period.

     Table of Contents  

Gross realized investment gains and losses, net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities and the change in the fair value of investment-related derivative financial instruments for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Net Foreign Exchange (Gains) Losses 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company remeasured its monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which resulted in net foreign exchange gains of   $63.1 million   compared to net foreign exchange losses of   $29.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . The net foreign exchange gains in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   resulted from the British Sterling weakening against the U.S. dollar and other key currencies during the period resulting in the upward revaluation of net asset positions in those currencies. Additionally, sales of invested assets yielded realized foreign exchange gains recognized in net income that had previously been recognized as unrealized foreign exchange gains in other comprehensive income (loss). In the prior year, the net foreign exchange loss resulted principally from a decrease in the value of net asset positions in key foreign currencies as the U.S. dollar strengthened generally in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Additionally, sales of invested assets yielded realized foreign exchange losses recognized in net income which had previously been recognized as unrealized foreign exchange losses in other comprehensive income (loss).  
  Net Losses and Loss Expenses 
  The Company's net loss ratio for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased compared to the same period in   2015   due primarily to an increase in catastrophe losses incurred in   2016  .  
  The following table shows the net losses after adjustment for reinstatement premiums recorded by the Company in connection with current calendar year catastrophes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , catastrophe related losses added   4.5   percentage points to the Company's net loss ratio after adjustment for reinstatement premiums compared to   3.0   percentage points in the same period in   2015  .  
  Favorable loss reserve development was recorded in the current period in  the agriculture, casualty and other specialty and property, marine/energy and aviation lines of business in the Insurance segment and across all lines of business in the Reinsurance segment. Favorable prior year loss reserve development was   $174.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which decreased the net loss ratio by   9.9   percentage points, as compared to   $183.3 million   for the same period in   2015  , which decreased the net loss ratio by   13.0   percentage points. Favorable reserve development in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was lower than the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   in the Insurance segment due primarily  
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

to lower than expected reported losses in the casualty and other specialty line of business in the prior year compared to the current year. Favorable reserve development in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was lower than the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   in the Reinsurance segment due primarily to higher than expected reported losses in the casualty and property lines of business. 
  The Company participates in lines of business in which claims may not be reported for many years. Accordingly, management does not believe that reported claims are the only valid means for estimating ultimate obligations. Ultimate losses and loss expenses may differ materially from the amounts recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. These estimates are reviewed regularly and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the reserves are adjusted as necessary. Reserve adjustments, if any, are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined. The overall loss reserves were established by the Company's actuaries and reflect management's best estimate of ultimate losses. See "Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses" below for further discussion. 
  Acquisition Expenses 
  The acquisition expense ratio for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was higher than the same period in   2015   primarily due to growth in net premiums earned in the casualty and other specialty, property, marine/energy and aviation and professional lines of business in the Insurance segment, which incur a higher net acquisition expense rate, and a decline in net premiums earned in the agriculture line of business in the Insurance segment, which incurs a lower net acquisition expense rate.  This increase was partially offset by the addition of earned premiums in 2015 from the Company's acquisition of Montpelier, which had no associated acquisition costs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. 
  General and Administrative Expenses and Corporate Expenses 
  The Company's general and administrative expense ratio for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   6.1%   percentage points compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to transaction and integration costs associated with the Company's acquisition of Montpelier which were included in corporate expenses in 2015. Excluding transaction and integration costs related to Montpelier, general and administrative and corporate expenses increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to an increase in personnel costs associated with the addition of new underwriting teams and additional employees from the Company's acquisition of Montpelier. This increase was partially offset by increased ceding commission reimbursements as a result of additional purchases of reinsurance.  
  Income Tax (Benefit) Expense 
  The Company recorded an income tax benefit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $2.6 million   compared to an income tax expense of   $7.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . The tax benefit in   2016   resulted from changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance recorded at the Company's subsidiaries located in United States taxable jurisdictions. 
  Net Income 
  The Company generated net income of   $351.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to net income of   $247.2 million   in the same period of   2015  . The increase in net income was primarily due to increased net premiums earned, net foreign exchange gains, and net investment income and decreased corporate expenses, partially offset by increased net losses and loss expenses, acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses, higher amortization expense and higher impairment losses. 
  Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests 
  The Company's net income attributable to non-controlling interest was   $18.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.7 million   in the same period of   2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   33.3%   of BCRH's common shares and   25.2%   of BCGR's ordinary shares. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests relates to the share of the Company's net income attributable to the BCRH common shares and BCGR ordinary shares that are not owned by the Company. 
   
  Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had accrued losses and loss expense reserves of   $4.8 billion   (  December 31, 2015   -   $4.5 billion  ). This amount represents management's best estimate of the ultimate liability for payment of losses and loss expenses related to loss events. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's net paid losses and loss expenses were   $864.3 million   and   $843.2 million  , respectively. 
  As more fully described under "Reserving Process" in the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the   2015   Form 10-K, the Company incorporates a variety of actuarial methods and judgments in its reserving process. Two key inputs in the various actuarial methods employed by the Company are initial expected loss ratios and expected loss reporting patterns. These key inputs impact the potential variability in the estimate of the reserve for losses and loss expenses and are applicable to each of the Company's business segments. The Company's loss  
  
   54 

     Table of Contents  

and loss expense reserves consider and reflect, in part, deviations resulting from differences between expected loss and actual loss reporting as well as judgments relating to the weights applied to the reserve levels indicated by the actuarial methods. Expected loss reporting patterns are based upon internal and external historical data and assumptions regarding claims reporting trends over a period of time that extends beyond the Company's own operating history. 
  Differences between actual reported losses and expected losses are anticipated to occur in any individual period and such deviations may influence future initial expected loss ratios and/or expected loss reporting patterns as the recent actual experience becomes part of the historical data utilized as part of the ongoing reserve estimation process. The Company has demonstrated the impact of changes in the speed of the loss reporting patterns, as well as changes in the expected loss ratios, within the tables under the heading "Potential Variability in Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses" in the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Losses and loss expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are summarized as follows: 

Losses and loss expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $54.3 million   and   $174.0 million   in favorable development of reserves relating to prior accident years, respectively. The favorable loss reserve development experienced during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   benefited the Company's reported net loss ratios by approximately   8.9   and   9.9   percentage points, respectively. This net reduction in estimated losses for prior accident

years reflects lower than expected claims emergence for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   in the agriculture, casualty and other specialty and property, marine/energy and aviation lines of business within the Insurance segment, and all lines of business within the Reinsurance segment. 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not materially alter the key inputs utilized to establish reserve for losses and loss expenses (initial expected loss ratios and loss reporting patterns) related to prior years for the insurance and reinsurance segments as the variances in reported losses for those segments were within the range of possible results anticipated by the Company. 
  Losses and loss expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   are summarized as follows: 

Losses and loss expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   included   $67.3 million   and   $183.3 million   in favorable development of reserves relating to prior accident years, respectively. The favorable loss reserve development experienced during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   benefited the Company's reported net loss ratio by approximately   12.1   and   13.0   percentage points, respectively. This net reduction in estimated losses for prior accident years reflects lower than expected claims emergence for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   in the  agriculture, casualty and other specialty and property, marine/energy and aviation lines of business within the Insurance segment and all lines of business within the Reinsurance segment.

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company did not materially alter the two key inputs utilized to establish its reserve for losses and loss expenses (initial expected loss ratios and loss reporting patterns) for business related to prior years for the insurance and reinsurance segments as the variances in reported losses for those segments were within the range of possible results anticipated by the Company. 
  Insurance 
  Agriculture.   For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded favorable loss emergence due to lower than anticipated multi-peril crop insurance claims settlements for the   2015   crop year. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded modest favorable loss emergence due to lower than anticipated crop hail insurance claims settlements for the 2014 crop year. 
  Casualty and other specialty.   For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded favorable loss emergence within this line of business primarily due to lower than expected claims activity, particularly within the Bermuda healthcare and excess casualty businesses, which was partially offset by unfavorable development on the Company's U.S. based small commercial casualty business taken during the second quarter of 2016. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded favorable loss emergence within this line of business primarily due to lower than expected claims activity, particularly within the Bermuda excess casualty business.  
  Professional lines.   For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's professional lines insurance booked ultimate losses for prior years were relatively stable as reported loss activity was in line with expectations.  
  Property, marine/energy and aviation.   For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the favorable loss emergence within the property, marine/energy and aviation line of business was primarily due to lower than expected reported claims emergence within the property line of business, particularly for business written in the Company's Lloyd's operation. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the favorable loss emergence within the property, marine/energy and aviation line of business was primarily due to lower than expected claims emergence for the U.K. property and energy lines of business. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the favorable development largely emanated from the Company's Lloyd's operation. 
  Reinsurance 
  Catastrophe.   For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded favorable loss emergence within this line of business primarily due to lower than expected claims activity within both the U.S. and international property catastrophe businesses.  
  Property.   For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded favorable loss emergence in the property line of business primarily due to lower than expected claims activity within the property treaty business, as lower than expected claims activity in the U.S. and Bermuda offset greater than expected claims activity in Europe.  
  Casualty  . For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded favorable loss emergence within this line of business primarily due to lower than expected claims activity, particularly for business arising from the Company's Bermuda operation. 
  Professional lines  . For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded favorable loss emergence within this line of business primarily due to lower than expected directors and officers liability claims emergence in prior accident years.  
  Specialty.   For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded favorable loss emergence within this line of business primarily due to lower than expected claims activity within the marine, aerospace, political risk and mortgage businesses. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded favorable loss emergence within this line of business primarily due to lower than expected claims activity in the Company's aerospace, surety and marine lines of business.

Underwriting Results by Business Segments 
  The determination of the Company's business segments is based on the manner in which management monitors the performance of the Company's underwriting operations. As a result, we report two business segments   Insurance and Reinsurance. 
  Management measures the Company's results on the basis of the combined ratio, which is obtained by dividing the sum of the losses and loss expenses, acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned. The Company's historic combined ratios may not be indicative of future underwriting performance. When purchased within a single line of business, ceded reinsurance and recoveries are accounted for within that line of business. When purchased across multiple lines of business, ceded reinsurance and recoveries are allocated to the lines of business in proportion to the related risks assumed. The Company does not manage its assets by business segment; accordingly, investment income and total assets are not allocated to the individual business segments. General and administrative expenses incurred by the business segments are allocated directly. Remaining general and administrative expenses not incurred by the business segments are classified as corporate expenses and are not allocated to the individual business segments. Ceded reinsurance and recoveries are recorded within the business segment to which they apply.

  The following table summarizes the underwriting results and associated ratios for the Company's Insurance segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Premiums  .   Gross premiums written for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   in the Insurance segment increased by   26.7%   and   20.8%   over the same period in   2015  . Gross and net premiums written for each line of business in the Insurance segment were as follows: 

The movements in the gross premiums written in the Insurance segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   were primarily due to the following factors:    
             
    An increase in gross premiums written in the property, marine/energy and aviation, professional lines and casualty and other specialty lines of business due primarily to business generated by new underwriting teams in the U.S. and the U.K. and new business resulting from the acquisition of Montpelier; and

A decline in gross premiums written in the agriculture line of business due to lower commodity prices. 
     Ceded premiums written increased during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . Increased gross premiums written resulted in increased ceded premiums under the whole account quota share treaty covering the entire Insurance segment's business, combined with additional purchases of facultative and excess of loss reinsurance in the property, marine/energy and aviation line of business. In the agriculture line of business, the decline in ceded premiums written during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , resulted from changes in premium estimates subject to cessions, which resulted in an increase in cessions in the third quarter of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, ceded premiums written decreased in the current period compared to 2015 due to lower gross premiums written and the timing of third party reinsurance contract placements.   
  Net premiums earned by the Company in the Insurance segment increased in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increase was a result of growth in gross premiums written partially offset by increased ceded premiums across the segment.

The net loss ratios in the Company's Insurance segment increased by   14.8   and   3.9   percentage points for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increase in the net loss ratios for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to increased attritional and large losses, primarily within the property, marine/energy and aviation lines of business. Five large industry losses totaling $2.0 billion in this line of business resulted in net losses of $16.4 million in the current periods. Partially offsetting these increases was lower net losses in the agriculture line due to improved growing conditions for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company's previously estimated losses and loss expense reserves for the Insurance segment for prior accident years were reduced by   $9.6 million   and   $57.0 million  , respectively, which decreased the net loss ratio by   3.5   and   7.6   percentage points, respectively, as compared to a reduction of   $22.6 million   and   $61.8 million  , respectively, that decreased the net loss ratios by   9.6   and   10.8   percentage points, respectively, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Lower levels of favorable loss development in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2015   was experienced mainly in the casualty and other specialty line of business, with the agriculture line of business experiencing higher favorable loss development.  
  Acquisition Expenses  .   The acquisition expense ratios in the Insurance segment in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to growth in net earned premiums in the property, marine/energy and aviation and casualty and other specialty lines of business, which incur a higher than average net acquisition expense rate, and a decline in the proportion of net earned premiums attributable to the agriculture line of business, which incurs a lower than average net acquisition expense rate. 
  General and Administrative Expenses  .   The general and administrative expense ratio in the Insurance segment in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased compared to the same period in   2015  , and decreased in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . General and administrative expenses increased for the current quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due to an increase in personnel costs associated with the addition of new underwriting teams and additional employees from the Company's acquisition of Montpelier over the past year, partially offset by increased ceding commission reimbursements as a result of additional purchases of reinsurance.

The movements in gross premiums written in the Reinsurance segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   were primarily due to the following factors:    
             
    An increase in gross premiums written in the catastrophe line of business due to new business resulting from the acquisition of Montpelier, partially offset by non-renewal of policies that no longer met profitability targets and declines in rates; 
                
    An increase in gross premiums written in the property line of business for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to new business resulting from the acquisition of Montpelier, partially offset by non-renewal of policies that no longer met profitability targets and declines in rates; 
                
    A decline in gross premiums written in the property line of business for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the non-renewal of a large contract and declines in signed lines; 
                
    An increase in gross premiums written in the specialty line of business due to new agriculture, marine and aerospace business written and increased renewals, partially offset by non-renewal of policies that no longer met profitability targets;  
                
    An increase in gross premiums written in the casualty line of business for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to new business written in the U.S. and the U.K. and new business resulting from the acquisition of Montpelier, partially offset by non-renewal of policies that no longer met profitability targets; and 
                
    A decline in gross premiums written in the casualty line of business for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the timing of renewals for certain multi-year deals, partially offset by new business. 
              Ceded premiums written increased in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015  . Ceded premiums written increased due to increased purchases of aggregate excess of loss retrocessional protection within the catastrophe line of business, and additional quota share and excess of loss retrocessional coverage purchased on the specialty line of business during the current periods. 
  Net premiums earned by the Company in the Reinsurance segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased compared to net premiums earned during the same periods in   2015   due to the earning of premiums acquired in the Montpelier acquisition.  
  Other Underwriting (Loss) Income.   Other underwriting (loss) income decreased for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in other underwriting (loss) income for the   three and nine   months was primarily due to decreased income from the Company's weather derivative products for the periods and the cost of the adverse loss development cover with Selective Insurance Group, Inc. ("Selective") as part of the sale of Montpelier U.S. Insurance Company ("MUSIC") to Selective which ensures that MUSIC's reserve for losses and loss expenses relating to retained business written on or prior to December 31, 2011 remains adequate.. 
  Losses and Loss Expenses.   The net loss ratio in the Company's Reinsurance segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was consistent with the same period in 2015, and increased for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase in the net loss ratio for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in catastrophe losses.  
  The following tables show the net losses after adjustment for reinstatement premiums recorded by the Company in the Reinsurance segment in connection with current calendar year catastrophes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

The net losses from catastrophes added   1.8   and   7.7   percentage points to the Reinsurance segment's net loss ratios for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The net losses from catastrophes added   5.1   and   3.7   percentage points, respectively, to the Reinsurance segment's net loss ratios for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The Company recorded   $44.6 million   and   $117.0 million   of favorable prior year loss reserve development in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which benefited the net loss ratios by   13.2   and   11.5   percentage points, respectively, compared to   $44.8 million   and   $121.5 million   in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively,  which benefited the net loss ratios by   13.9   and   14.6   percentage points, respectively. Favorable reserve development in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was lower than the same periods in   2015   primarily in the casualty line of business.  
  Acquisition Expenses  .   The Company's acquisition expense ratio in the Reinsurance segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was higher than the same period in   2015   and lower for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   than in the same period in   2015  . The increase in the acquisition expense ratio for the current quarter was  primarily due to  the earning of premiums in 2015 from the Company's acquisition of Montpelier, which had no associated acquisition costs.  The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to earning of premiums in the current period from the Company's acquisition of Montpelier, which had no associated acquisition costs, and reduced profit commission and loss sensitive accruals due to increased loss activity compared to 2015.   
  General and Administrative Expenses  .   The general and administrative expense ratios in the Reinsurance segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased compared to the same periods in   2015   due to increased net earned premiums for the current periods. General and administrative expenses were consistent for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to the addition of new underwriting teams and additional employees from the Company's acquisition of Montpelier, offset by increased ceding commission reimbursements as a result of increased ceded premiums.  
   
  Subsequent Events 
  Merger with Sompo Holdings, Inc. 
  On October 5, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") for the acquisition of   100%   of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company by Sompo Holdings, Inc. ("SOMPO") for   $93.00   per share in cash (the "Merger"). The Merger has been approved by both companies' Board of Directors. The Merger is expected to close as soon as practicable following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including, but not limited to, approval by the Company's shareholders and regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that the Merger will occur.  
  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration for the Merger will be approximately $6,304.0 million in cash. The purchase will be financed by SOMPO with existing sources of liquidity and supplementary facilities without a financing contingency. 
  If the Merger is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company is obligated to pay SOMPO a cash termination fee of   $204.9 million   together with SOMPO's expenses relating to the Merger up to   $15.8 million  .

The Company incurred   $1.0 million   of corporate expenses associated with the Merger during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and is contractually obligated to pay investment banking fees upon closing of the Merger. The Company expects to incur additional costs and expenses associated with the Merger during the fourth quarter of   2016   and the first quarter of 2017. 
  Hurricane Matthew 
  On October 7 and 8, 2016, Hurricane Matthew affected the southeastern coast of the United States, ultimately making landfall in South Carolina. To date, reported claims as a result of this storm have been limited. While losses emanating from the storm cannot be accurately estimated at this time, the Company may need to establish appropriate loss reserves related to Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter of 2016, which may have a negative impact on its results of operations. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Endurance Holdings is a holding company that does not have any significant operations or assets other than its ownership of the shares of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Endurance Holdings relies primarily on dividends and other permitted distributions from its subsidiaries to pay its operating expenses, interest on debt and dividends, if any, on its ordinary shares, and its 6.35% Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares, Series C ("Series C Preferred Shares"). There are restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Company's operating subsidiaries to Endurance Holdings, which are described in more detail below. 
  Ability of Subsidiaries to Pay Dividends.   The ability of Endurance Bermuda to pay dividends is dependent on its ability to meet the requirements of applicable Bermuda law and regulations. Under Bermuda law, Endurance Bermuda may not declare or pay a dividend if there are reasonable grounds for believing that Endurance Bermuda is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or the realizable value of Endurance Bermuda's assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. Further, Endurance Bermuda, as a regulated insurance company in Bermuda, is subject to additional regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. As of   September 30, 2016  , Endurance Bermuda could pay a dividend or return additional paid-in capital totaling approximately   $720.7 million   (  December 31, 2015       $1,034.4 million  ) without prior regulatory approval based upon the Bermuda insurance and corporate regulations. In addition, in 2011, Endurance Holdings loaned Endurance Bermuda $200.0 million, which remains outstanding and is callable on demand.  
  Each of the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries, except American Agri-Business Insurance Company ("American Agri-Business") is subject to regulation by the State of Delaware Department of Insurance. American Agri-Business is subject to regulation by the Texas Department of Insurance. Dividends for each U.S. operating subsidiary are limited to the greater of 10% of policyholders' surplus or statutory net income, excluding realized capital gains. In addition, dividends may only be declared or distributed out of earned surplus. At   December 31, 2015  , none of the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries, except American Agri-Business, had earned surplus; therefore, these companies are precluded from declaring or distributing dividends at   September 30, 2016   without the prior approval of the applicable insurance regulator. At   September 30, 2016  , American Agri-Business could pay dividends of   $3.5 million   with notice to the Texas Department of Insurance. In addition, any dividends paid by Endurance American, Endurance American Specialty and Endurance Risk Solutions would be subject to the dividend limitation of their respective parent insurance companies. 
  Under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom's Prudential Regulation Authority ("PRA") and the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"), Endurance Worldwide Insurance Limited ("Endurance U.K.") must maintain a margin of solvency at all times, which is determined based on the type and amount of insurance business written. The PRA regulatory requirements impose no explicit restrictions on Endurance U.K.'s ability to pay a dividend, but Endurance U.K. would have to notify the PRA 28 days prior to any proposed dividend payment. Dividends may only be distributed from profits available for distributions. At   September 30, 2016  , Endurance U.K. did not have retained profits available for distributions. 
  Endurance Corporate Capital Limited, Syndicate 5151 and Endurance at Lloyd's Limited ("Endurance at Lloyd's") are subject to oversight by the Council of Lloyd's. Endurance at Lloyd's is also subject to regulation by the PRA and the FCA. Underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd's must be supported by providing a deposit in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit, which are referred to as Funds at Lloyd's ("FAL"). This amount is determined by Lloyd's and is based on Syndicate 5151's solvency and capital requirement as calculated through its internal model. In addition, if the FAL are not sufficient to cover all losses, the Lloyd's Central Fund provides an additional level of security for policyholders. At   September 30, 2016  , the FAL requirement set by Lloyd's for Syndicate 5151 was   $278.5 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $215.2 million  ) based on its business plan, approved in December 2015. Actual FAL posted for Syndicate 5151 at   September 30, 2016   was   $278.6 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $276.8 million  ). At   September 30, 2016  , Endurance Corporate Capital Limited did not have assets available for distribution.

Cash and Invested Assets.   The Company's aggregate invested assets, including fixed maturity investments, short-term investments, equity securities, other investments, cash and cash equivalents and pending securities transactions, as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $8.8 billion   compared to aggregate invested assets of   $8.9 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's available for sale investments had gross unrealized gains of   $107.1 million   and gross unrealized losses of   $7.8 million   compared to gross unrealized gains of   $40.8 million   and gross unrealized losses of   $72.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease in gross unrealized losses on the Company's available for sale investments at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. The Company did not have the intent to sell any of its fixed income investments in an unrealized loss position and determined that it was unlikely that the Company would be required to sell securities in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company impaired certain equity securities that were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve consecutive months and therefore recognized in earnings total other-than-temporary impairments of   $10.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company's aggregate direct exposure to the indebtedness and equity securities of those countries whose currency is the Euro or whose sovereign debt rating is below AAA (except the U.S.) was   $913.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $820.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Cash Flows 

Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   improved compared to the same period in   2015   as growth in cash inflows from premium collections and lower levels of gross loss payments were partially offset by lower ceded loss collections and higher payments of ceded premiums.  
  Investing activity cash flows reflect the Company's active management of its investment portfolio to generate attractive economic returns and income. Movements in financial markets and interest rates influence the timing of investment sales and purchases. The decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities in   2016   is primarily due to the decrease in cash assumed from the acquisition of Montpelier in 2015, offset by the increased investment asset base due to the acquisition of Montpelier. 
  The cash flows used in financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   were higher than in the same period in   2015   as a result of the repayment of the Series B preferred shares, higher dividends paid and debt repayments and increased net distributions to non-controlling interest, offset by increased proceeds from the issuance of repurchase agreements. 
  Foreign exchange rate changes had a positive impact on the cash balances of the Company in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as the British Sterling weakened against most key currencies in the period resulting in an increase in the reported value of holdings in those currencies in the accounts of the Company's U.K. subsidiary.  Additionally, the Japanese Yen strengthened significantly in the period resulting in the upward revaluation of Yen holdings across the Company's subsidiaries. Foreign exchange rate changes in the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2015   had a negative impact on the cash balances of the Company as the U.S. dollar strengthened against all key currencies in the period resulting in a decrease in the reported value of holdings in those currencies. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had pledged cash and cash equivalents and fixed maturity investments of   $111.2 million   and   $108.9 million  , respectively, in favor of certain ceding companies to collateralize obligations. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had also pledged   $319.3 million   and   $383.3 million   of its cash and fixed maturity investments to meet collateral obligations for   $278.7 million   and   $341.6 million  , respectively, in letters of credit outstanding under its Credit Facility (as defined below) and LOC Agreements (as defined below). In addition, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , cash and fixed maturity investments with fair values of   $211.1 million   and   $208.3 million   were on deposit with U.S. state regulators, respectively.

Credit Facilities.   On March 23, 2016, the Company and certain designated subsidiaries of the Company entered into a $450.0 million five-year letter of credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan") as administrative agent ("Credit Facility"). Upon entering into the Credit Facility, the Company terminated its existing $700.0 million credit agreement, dated April 19, 2012, with JPMorgan as administrative agent. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility of   $255.3 million   (  December 31, 2015       $329.9 million  ).

  The Company is required to pay a fee of 0.40% per annum on the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the Company to pay to the lenders a commitment fee in the amount of 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the unused commitments of the lenders. The Credit Facility permits a lender, if requested and in its discretion, to issue a letter of credit pursuant to which it fronts for the other lenders. For such letters of credit, such fronting lenders may receive certain fronting fees from the Company.  
  The Credit Facility requires the Company's compliance with certain customary restrictive covenants, including a financial covenant that the Company maintain a leverage ratio of no greater than 0.35:1.00 at any time. In addition, each of the Company's regulated insurance subsidiaries that has a claims paying rating from A.M. Best must maintain a rating of at least B++ at all times.  
  The Credit Facility also contains customary event of default provisions, including failure to pay any unpaid drawing under a letter of credit under the Credit Facility or interest thereon and failure to pay any fee under the Credit Facility, insolvency events of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries), a change in control of the Company, a breach of the representations or covenants in the Credit Facility or the security documents relating thereto and certain defaults by the Company or its subsidiaries under other indebtedness. In the case of an event of default that occurs as a result of an insolvency event of the Company or one of its designated subsidiary borrowers, the commitments of the lenders will automatically terminate and the repayment of outstanding obligations will be automatically accelerated. Upon the occurrence of any other event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders can terminate their commitments under the Credit Facility, require repayment of any outstanding obligations under the Credit Facility, give notice of non-extension of any outstanding letters of credit in accordance with their terms, require the delivery of cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit and foreclose on any collateral held by the lenders (or any agent on their behalf) under the Credit Facility. 
  The Company is party to certain uncommitted letter of credit reimbursement agreements ("LOC Agreements") that allow for the issuance of letters of credit in a variety of currencies, including U.S. dollars. The fees paid under the LOC Agreements depend on the amount of the outstanding letters of credit and vary from   0.30%   to   0.45%   on the principal amount of letters of credit outstanding to a fee negotiated at the time of issuance of the individual letters of credit. The total amount of letters of credit outstanding under the LOC Agreements as of   September 30, 2016   was   $23.3 million   (  December 31, 2015   -   $11.7 million  ).  
  BCRH Credit Agreement.    Upon closing of the acquisition of Montpelier on July 31, 2015, the Company became a guarantor of the BCRH   364  -day unsecured credit agreement (the "BCRH Credit Agreement"), which permitted BCRH to borrow up to   $20.0 million   on a revolving basis for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company was entitled to receive an annual guarantee fee from BCRH equal to   0.125%   of the facility's total capacity.

  Repurchase agreements.   At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's repurchase agreement obligations of   $121.0 million   were fully collateralized. The following table presents the fair value of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements by investment category. The remaining contractual maturity of the repurchase agreements at September 30, 2016 is less than   30   days.  

Pledged collateral levels are monitored daily and are generally maintained at an agreed-upon percentage of the fair value of the amounts borrowed during the life of the transaction. In the event of a decline in the fair value of the pledged collateral under these agreements, the Company may be required to transfer cash or additional securities as pledged collateral under these agreements. At the termination of the transactions, the Company and its counterparties are obligated to return the amounts borrowed and the securities provided as collateral, respectively. 
    Historically, the operating subsidiaries of the Company have generated sufficient cash flows to meet all of their obligations. Because of the inherent volatility of the business written by the Company, the seasonality in the timing of payments by ceding companies, the irregular timing of loss payments, the impact of a change in interest rates on the Company's investment returns as well as seasonality in coupon payment dates for fixed maturity investments, cash flows from the Company's operating activities may vary significantly between periods. The Company expects to generate positive operating cash flows through   2016  , absent the occurrence of additional significant loss events. In the event that paid losses accelerate beyond the ability to fund such payments from operating cash flows, the Company would use its cash balances available, liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio, or arrange for additional financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in executing these strategies. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Certain of the Company's ongoing obligations to Selective Insurance Group, Inc. in connection with the sale of Montpelier U.S. Insurance Company and the Company's previous guarantee of BCGR's obligations under the BCGR Credit Agreement constitute off-balance sheet arrangements. Excluding these specific transactions, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K, to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future

effect on the Company's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that the Company believes is material to investors. 
   
  Currency and Foreign Exchange 
  The Company's functional currencies are U.S. dollars for its U.S., Bermuda and Lloyd's operations (including Endurance at Lloyd's, Syndicate 5151 and Endurance Corporate Capital Limited from January 1, 2016 forward), and British Sterling for Endurance U.K. The reporting currency for all operations is U.S. dollars. The Company maintains a portion of its investments and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company has made a significant investment in the capitalization of Endurance U.K. and Endurance Corporate Capital Limited, which are subject to the PRA's rules concerning the matching of the currency of its assets to the currency of its liabilities. Depending on the profile of Endurance U.K.'s and Syndicate 5151's liabilities, Endurance U.K. and Endurance Corporate Capital Limited may be required to hold some of their respective assets in currencies corresponding to the currencies of its liabilities. The Company may, from time to time, experience gains or losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. 
  Assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The effect of the translation adjustments for foreign operations is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
  Other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses included in earnings. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date. 
   
  Effects of Inflation 
  The effects of inflation could cause the severity of claims to rise in the future. The Company's estimates for losses and loss expenses include assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses, such as medical treatments and litigation costs. To the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims, the Company will be required to increase the reserve for losses and loss expenses with a corresponding reduction in its earnings in the period in which the deficiency is identified. In addition, inflation could lead to higher interest rates causing the current unrealized gain position on the Company's fixed income portfolio to decrease or become an unrealized loss position. In response, the Company may choose to hold its fixed income investments to maturity, which would result in the unrealized gains or losses largely amortizing through net investment income. 
   
  Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk" included in the Company's   2015   Form 10-K. 
   
  Item 4.     Controls and Procedures 
  a)    Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act. 
  (b)    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company's   third   fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
  OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.     Legal Proceedings 
  We are party to various legal proceedings generally arising in the normal course of our business. While any proceeding contains an element of uncertainty, we do not believe that the eventual outcome of any litigation or arbitration proceeding to which we are presently a party could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or business. Pursuant to our insurance and reinsurance agreements, disputes are generally required to be finally settled by arbitration. 
   
  Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
  Before investing in any of our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors and all other information set forth in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by the risk factor set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and the following risk factors and other information in this Form 10-Q. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition and cause the trading price of our securities to decline.   You could lose all or part of your investment.   The headings used in this section are solely to aid the reader as to the general categories of risk related to investing in the Company. The risk factors listed may apply to more than one category or to the Company generally. Accordingly, the headings used in this section should not be construed as limiting in any manner the general applicability of any of the risk factors included in this section. 
  The Merger is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, or satisfied on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Merger could have material and adverse effects on the Company. 
  The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the approval by the Company's shareholders and the receipt of required approvals from governmental regulators, which make the completion and timing of the completion of the Merger uncertain.  In addition, regulators could impose additional requirements or obligations as conditions for their approvals, which may be burdensome and which may permit SOMPO under the terms of the Merger Agreement to refuse to complete the Merger. 
  If the Merger is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, the Company's ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, the Company will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 
             
    The Company s current stock price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will occur. In addition, as a result of the announcement of the Merger Agreement, trading in our common shares has increased substantially. If the Merger is not consummated, the investment goals of our shareholders may be materially different than those of our shareholders on a pre-Merger announcement basis. 
                
    Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to pay a termination fee of $204.9 million and reimburse SOMPO's expenses relating to the Merger up to $15.8 million; 
                
    The Company may be required to pay significant costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the Merger is completed; 
                
    Time and resources committed by the Company's management to matters relating to the Merger could otherwise have been devoted to the Company's existing business or to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; 
                
    The Merger may not have been completed as a result of the occurrence of an event, change or other circumstances that have a material adverse effect on the Company s business; 
                
    The manner in which brokers, insurers, cedants and other third parties perceive the Company may be negatively     impacted, which in turn could affect the ability of the Company to compete for or write new business or obtain renewals in the marketplace; 
                
    The Company's ratings may be adversely affected, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and operating results; and 
                
    The Company could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against the Company to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. 
     
   69 

     Table of Contents  

The Company is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect the Company's business and operations. 
  In connection with the pendency of the Merger, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom the Company has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with the Company as a result of the Merger, which could negatively affect the Company's revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of the Company's ordinary shares, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. 
  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. Such limitations could negatively affect the Company's business and operations prior to the completion of the Merger. 
  Uncertainties associated with the Merger may cause a loss of management and other key employees and disrupt our business relationships, which could adversely affect our business. 
  Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our employees and our customers may have an adverse effect on our business. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as employees of the Company may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. We face additional uncertainties relating to the Merger, including that our business relationships may be subject to disruption as brokers, insurers, cedants, customers and other third parties attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than the Company, SOMPO or the combined company. If key employees depart or if our existing business relationships suffer, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The adverse effects of such disruptions could be further exacerbated by any delay in the completion of the Merger. 
  The Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us for greater consideration than what SOMPO has agreed to pay. 
  The Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to sell our business to a company other than SOMPO. These provisions include a general prohibition on us soliciting any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction, subject to limited exceptions. If we or SOMPO terminate the Merger Agreement, we may in some circumstances be required to reimburse SOMPO for its incurred out-of-pocket expenses (not to exceed   $15.8 million  ) and, if we subsequently are, or agree to be acquired by another company, pay to SOMPO a termination fee of   $204.9 million  . Further, our Board of Directors has agreed in the Merger Agreement, subject to limited exceptions, that it will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to SOMPO its recommendation that our shareholders approve the Merger. These provisions might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing an acquisition, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee or the payment of expenses that may become payable in certain circumstances.
