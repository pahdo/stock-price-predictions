     PART I   
     ITEM 1.
BUSINESS.   
  J.W. Mays, Inc. (the
 Company  or  Registrant ) with executive offices at 9 Bond Street, Brooklyn,
New York 11201, operates a number of commercial real estate properties, which
are described in Item 2  Properties . The Company s business was founded in 1924
and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on July 6,
1927.  
  The Company has 30
employees and has a contract, expiring November 30, 2016, with a union covering
rates of pay, hours of employment and other conditions of employment for
approximately 23% of its employees. The Company considers that its labor
relations with its employees and union are good.  
   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   
  This Annual Report on Form
10-K may contain forward-looking statements which include assumptions about
future market conditions, operations and financial results. These statements are
based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. They
are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. The Company s actual results, performance or achievements in
the future could differ significantly from the results, performance or
achievements discussed or implied in such forward-looking statements herein and
in prior U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) filings by the
Company. The Company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking
statements or to advise of changes in the assumptions on which they were
based.  
  Factors that could cause or
contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, changes in the
competitive environment of the Company, general economic and business
conditions, industry trends, changes in government rules and regulations and
environmental rules and regulations. Statements concerning interest rates and
other financial instrument fair values and their estimated contribution to the
Company s future results of operations are based upon market information as of a
specific date. This market information is often a function of significant
judgment and estimation. Further, market interest rates are subject to potential
significant volatility.  
     ITEM 1A. RISK
FACTORS.   
   Risks Relating to
Ownership Structure   
  The controlling shareholder
group may be able to vote its shares in favor of its interests that may not
always coincide with the interests of shareholders not part of such group. This
risk may be counter-balanced to a degree by the actions of the Board of
Directors whose composition is made up of a majority of independent
directors.  
  The controlling shareholder
group includes a corporation that owns a significant percentage of the Company s
common stock and which does business with the Company, as further described in
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In theory, this could result
in a conflict of interest; nevertheless, the Company and its largest shareholder
have put in place some controls to reduce the effects of any perceived conflict
of interest.  
  Certain conflicts of
interest may be perceived by the relationship between the Company and its
largest shareholder. Both entities have the same Chief Executive Officer, and
certain management personnel work for both entities. Nevertheless, the Company s
Board of Directors ( Board ) is composed of a majority of independent directors.
As recently as 2005, in a case involving both entities, the Delaware Supreme
Court in connection with an attempt to obtain books and records of the Company
through a proceeding against the Company s significant shareholder, held that
the actions of the Company s Board were proper.

   Risks Related to Our
Business   
  We are a part of the
communities in which we do business. Accordingly, like other businesses in our
communities, we are subject to the following risks:  

the continued threat
      of terrorism;      

economic downturns,
      both on a national and on local scales;      

loss of key
      personnel;      

the availability, if
      needed, of additional financing;      

the continued
      availability of insurance (in different types of policies) at reasonably
      acceptable rates;      

the general burdens
      of governmental regulation, at the Local, State and Federal
      levels;      

climate change;
      and      

cyber
      security.     
   Risks Related to Real
Estate Operations   
  Our investment in property
development may be limited by increasing costs required to  fit up  property to
be leased to tenants. Also, as the cost of fitting up properties increases, we
may be required to wait and forsake opportunities that would be revenue
producing until such time that we obtain the necessary financing of such
ventures. This risk may be mitigated by our obtaining lines of credit and other
financing vehicles, although such have significant limitations on the amounts
that may be borrowed at any point in time.  
  We also may be subject to
environmental liability as an owner or operator of properties. Many of our
properties are old and when we need to fit up a property for a new tenant, we
may find materials and the like that could be deemed to contain hazardous
elements requiring remediation or encapsulation.  
  We try to lease our
properties to tenants with adequate finances, but as a result of the economic
downturn, even formerly financially strong tenants may be at risk. The Company
is trying to mitigate the latter by leasing our properties to multiple tenants
where applicable in order to diversify the tenant base.  
   Risks Related to our
Investments   
  Excess cash and cash
equivalents may be invested from time to time. We seek to earn rates of return
that will help us finance our business operations. These investments may be
subject to significant uncertainties and may not be successful for many reasons,
including, but not limited to the following:  

fluctuations in
      interest rates;      

worsening of general
      economic and market conditions; and      

adverse legal,
      financial and regulatory developments that may affect a particular
      business.      
   Risk Factors Summary
   
  These are some of the  Risk
Factors  that could affect the Company s business. The Company endeavors to take
actions and do business in a way that reduces these  Risk Factors  or, at least,
takes them into account when conducting its business. Nevertheless, some of
these  Risk Factors  cannot be avoided so that the Company must also take
actions and do business that negates the adverse effects that these may have on
the Company.  
     ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED
STAFF COMMENTS.   
  There are no unresolved
comments from the staff of the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission as of

PROPERTIES.   
  The table below sets forth
certain information as to each of the properties currently operated by the
Company:  
  
  Properties are leased under
long-term leases for varying periods, the longest of which extends to 2073, and
in most instances renewal options are included. Reference is made to Note 5 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the 2016 Annual Report to
Shareholders, incorporated herein by reference. The property owned which is held
subject to mortgage is the Brooklyn Fulton Street at Bond Street
building.  

1.   
       Brooklyn, New York Fulton Street at Bond
    Street    

10% of the property
      is leased by the Company under five separate leases. Expiration dates are
      as follows: 12/8/2043 (1 lease) which lease currently has one thirty-year
      renewal option through 12/8/2073. The Company in July 2012, exercised the
      first renewal option for thirty years ending 12/8/2043; 4/30/2021 (2
      leases), which leases previously had expiration dates of April 30, 2011
      and were extended for an additional ten years; and 4/30/31 (2 leases)
      which leases previously had expiration dates of April 30, 2011 and were
      extended for an additional twenty years.   
        The property is
      currently leased to twenty-one tenants of which nine are retail tenants,
      two are fast food restaurants and ten occupy office space. Two tenants
      have leased in excess of 10% of the rentable square footage. One tenant is
      a department store (33.42%) and the other tenant occupies office space
      (15.06%).  
        The Company was in litigation with a retail tenant who occupied
      7,401 square feet for non-payment of rent since June 2015. The tenant
      vacated the premises in December 2015. The Company has only accrued rent
      in the amount of the security deposit held, which is two months  rent. The
      loss in rents is approximately $450,000 per annum. The Company is actively
      seeking through brokers tenants to occupy the space.   
        In November 2015, the
      Company extended a lease with a retail tenant who occupies 1,000 square
      feet. The original expiration date was November 30, 2015 and was extended
      until November 30, 2020.

In March 2016, the
      Company extended a lease with a retail tenant who occupies 126,996 square
      feet. The original expiration date was April 29, 2021 and was extended
      until January 31, 2036. The tenant also has two five year option periods.
        
        In April 2016, the
      Company extended a lease with an office tenant who occupies 11,128 square
      feet. The original expiration date was April 29, 2021 and was extended
      until January 31, 2036. The tenant also has two five year option periods.
        
        In May 2016, an
      office tenant who occupies 1,558 square feet extended its lease for an
      additional five year period ending on July 31, 2021.   
        It is the intention
      of the Company to negotiate the renewals of the expiring leases as they
      come due, providing the tenants maintain adequate finances.

In July 2016, an
      office tenant who occupies 13,460 square feet extended its lease for an
      additional seven year period ending June 30, 2023.   
        It is the intention
      of the Company to negotiate the renewals of the expiring leases as they
      come due, providing the tenants maintain adequate finances.

As of July 31, 2016
      the federal tax basis is $7,443,176 with accumulated depreciation of
      $3,837,029 for a net carrying value of $3,606,147. The lives taken for
      depreciation vary between 15-40 years and the methods used are
      straight-line and declining balance.  
        The real estate taxes
      for this property are $539,671 per year and the rate used is averaged at
      $11.282 per $100 of assessed valuation.    

3.   
       Jamaica, New York Jamaica Avenue at 169th
    Street    

The building is owned
      and the land is leased from an affiliated company. The lease expires July
      31, 2027. The property is currently leased to ten tenants: six are retail
      tenants and four occupy office space. Four tenants each occupy in excess
      of 10% of the rentable square footage: two retail stores occupy 15.86% and
      17.68%, respectively; and two office tenants occupy 14.23% and 12.83%,
      respectively. Approximately 23,000 square feet of the building is
      available for lease. There are plans to renovate vacant space for office
      use upon the execution of future leases to tenants, although no assurances
      can be made as to when or if such leases will be entered into.   
        A tenant who occupies
      2,000 square feet of office space terminated its lease as of December 31,
      2015. In July 2016, the Company leased these premises to an existing
      tenant at an increased rental.  
        It is the intention
      of the Company to negotiate the renewals of the expiring leases as they
      come due, providing the tenants maintain adequate
  finances.

6.   
       Massapequa, New
      York Sunrise Highway    

The Company is the
      prime tenant of this leasehold. The lease expired May 14, 2009, and there
      was one renewal option for twenty-one years, which the Company exercised
      in April 2008. The leasehold is currently subleased to one tenant for use
      as a bank. The bank occupies 85.01% of the property. The sublease expires
      in May 2030, with no renewal options. A fast food restaurant which
      occupied the remaining 14.99% of the property, vacated the premises in
      June 2014. The loss in annual rental revenue is approximately $200,000. The Company is utilizing brokers to actively seek tenants to
      occupy the vacated space. Currently there are no plans for additional
      improvements to this property.

7.   
       Circleville,
      Ohio Tarlton Road    

The Company owns the
      entire property. The property is currently leased to two tenants. The
      tenants use these premises for warehouse and distribution facilities. One
      tenant s lease agreement was executed for a five year period, with a right
      to cancel after three years, for 75,000 square feet to November 11, 2010
      at which time the tenant occupied 30,000 square feet on a month to month
      basis. In October 2013, the tenant signed a lease agreement for a five
      year period to occupy 48,000 square feet and in May 2015 signed a
      modification of lease to occupy 72,000 square feet. In August 2016, this
      tenant signed a further modification of lease to occupy 84,000 square
      feet. The other tenant s lease agreement was executed in May 2015, for a
      five-year period effective June 1, 2015, and allows the tenant to have

8.   
       Brooklyn, New York Livingston Street    

The City of
      New York through its Economic Development Administration constructed a
      municipal garage at Livingston Street opposite the Company s Brooklyn
      properties. The Company has a long-term lease with the City of New York
      and another landlord which expired in 2013. The lease has two renewal
      options, the last of which expires in 2073. The Company exercised one of
      the renewal options in July 2012 for an additional thirty year period,
      expiring in 2043, under which:   

(1)  
      Such garage provided
      truck bays and passage facilities through a tunnel, both for the exclusive
      use of the Company, to the structure referred to in (2) below. The truck
      bays, passage facilities and tunnel, totaling approximately 17,000 square
      feet, are included in the lease from the City of New York and another
      landlord referred to in the preceding paragraph.   

On June 16, 2014, the
      Company entered into a Second Amendment of Lease (the  Amendment ) with 33
      Bond St. LLC ( Bond ), its landlord, for certain truck bays and
      approximately 1,000 square feet located at the cellar level within a
      garage at Livingston and Bond Street ( Premises ). Pursuant to the
      Amendment, (1) a lease option for the Premises was exercised extending the
      lease until December 8, 2043,    
  7  

Table of
Contents    

(2) the Company,
      simultaneously with the execution of the Amendment, vacated the Premises
      so that Bond may demolish the building in which the Premises is located in
      order to develop and construct a new building at the location, and (3)
      Bond agreed to redeliver to the Company possession of the reconfigured
      Premises after construction.   
        As consideration
      under the Amendment, Bond agreed to pay the Company a total of $3,500,000.
      Upon execution of the Amendment, the Company recorded $3,500,000 to
      deferred revenue to be amortized to revenue to temporally vacate the
      premises over the expected vacate period of 36 months. Bond tendered
      $2,250,000 simultaneously with the execution of the Amendment, and the
      balance due of $1,250,000 on June 16, 2015 had been received by the
      Company.   
        In connection with
      the Amendment, the parties also agreed to settle a pending lawsuit in the
      Supreme Court of the State of New York, Kings County, Index No. 50796/13
      (the  Action ), in which the Company sought, among other things, a
      declaratory judgment that it validly renewed the lease for the Premises,
      and Bond sought, among other things, a declaratory judgment that the lease
      expired by its terms on December 8, 2013. Pursuant to a stipulation of
      settlement, filed on June 16, 2014, the Action, including all claims and
      counterclaims, has been discontinued with prejudice, without costs or
      attorneys  fees to any party as against the other. The stipulation of
      settlement also contains general releases by both parties of all claims.

(2)  
      The Company
      constructed a building of six stories and basement on a 20 x 75-foot plot
      (acquired and made available by the City of New York and leased to the
      Company for a term expiring in 2013 with renewal options, the last of
      which expires in 2073). The Company in July 2012, exercised the first
      renewal option for thirty years, ending in 2043. The plot is adjacent to
      and connected with the Company s Brooklyn properties.   

In the opinion of
      management, all of the Company s properties are adequately covered by
      insurance.  
        See Note 10 to the
      Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the 2016 Annual Report to
      Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference, for
      information concerning the tenants, the rental income from which equals
      10% or more of the Company s rental income.     
     ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.   
  There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the Company. It is
the opinion of management that the resolution of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial
Statements.  
  If the Company sells, transfers, disposes of or demolishes 25 Elm Place,
Brooklyn, New York, then the Company may be liable to create a condominium unit
for the loading dock. The necessity of creating the condominium unit and the
cost of such condominium unit cannot be determined at this time.  
  Because of defective workmanship and breach of contract, the Company
commenced litigation against a contractor to pay damages and return in full
$376,467 of a deposit paid when work commenced to replace a roof on the
Fishkill, New York building. As of July 31, 2015, this deposit was included in
other assets on the consolidated balance sheet in security deposits. The Company
cannot predict the outcome of this matter and expects to vigorously pursue this
contractor until the deposit is returned and damages are paid. As there is a
reasonable possibility the contractor will not pay the Company in full, a charge
to real estate operating expenses in the amount of $279,213 was recorded as of
July 31, 2016, the difference between the deposit amount when work commenced and
outstanding invoices due the contractor.

         CHANGES IN AND
      DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
      DISCLOSURE.       
  There are no disagreements between the Company and its accountants

     ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES.   
   (A) EVALUATION OF
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   
  The Company s management reviewed the Company s internal controls and
procedures and the effectiveness of these controls. As of July 31, 2016, the
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of, and with the
participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-14(c) and
15d-14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
them to material information relating to the Company required to be included in
its periodic SEC filings.  
   (B) CHANGE TO INTERNAL
CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.   
  There was no change in the Company s internal controls over financial
reporting or in other factors during the Company s last fiscal quarter that
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal controls over financial reporting. There were no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses noted, and therefore there were no
corrective actions taken.

   (C) MANAGEMENT S ANNUAL
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.   
  The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in
Rule 13(a)-15(f). Our internal control system has been designed to provide
reasonable assurance to the Company s management and its Board of Directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial
statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations. Even those systems that have been determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. The Company s management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31,
2016. In making this assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control   Integrated Framework published in 2013. Based on the
Company s assessments, we believe that, as of July 31, 2016, its internal
control over financial reporting is effective based on these
criteria.  
  This Form 10-K Annual Report does not include an attestation report of
our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by
our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the permanent
exemption for smaller reporting company filers from the internal control audit
requirement of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

   SUMMARY OF SELECTED
FINANCIAL DATA    (dollars in
thousands except per share data)  
 
  * Reclassified for
      comparative purposes. See note
17.  
   THE
COMPANY   
  J.W. Mays, Inc. was founded
in 1924 and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on July 6,
1927.  
  The Company operates a
number of commercial real estate properties located in Brooklyn and Jamaica in
New York City; in Levittown and Massapequa, Long Island, New York; in Fishkill,
Dutchess County, New York; and in Circleville, Ohio. The major portion of these
properties is owned and the balance is leased. A substantial percentage of these
properties are leased to tenants while the remainder is available for
lease.  
  More comprehensive
information concerning the Company appears in its Form 10-K Annual Report for
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016.  
  2  

J.W. MAYS,
INC.   
   TO OUR
SHAREHOLDERS:   
  The financial condition of
our Company continued to be strong during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016
with profits earned in each of the four quarters during this period.  
  In fiscal 2016, our
revenues from operations were $18,582,854 compared to $18,909,777 in the 2015
fiscal year. Net income for fiscal 2016 was $1,517,760, or $.75 per share. This
compares to net income of $2,208,682, or $1.10 per share for fiscal
2015.  
  The Company was able to
extend seven leases with existing tenants: three at its Jowein and four at its
Nine Bond Street buildings in Brooklyn, New York. These lease extensions
combined with increased rentals from existing tenants should help enable the
Company to maintain consistent revenue growth from operations in the future. The
Company s revenue during fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included $1,166,667 from
temporarily vacating a lease.  
  Our emphasis on pursuing
and obtaining government agencies, educational institutions and prospective
corporate and retail tenants has helped us to have strong rental income and net
income and, to a great extent, we have been able to retain these tenants over a
long period of time.  
  I believe our Company is
well-positioned to continue its positive operational performance. I specifically
want to thank the Mays  personnel and our Board colleagues for their ongoing
commitment and support, our shareholders for their continuing belief in our
Company and its future and our tenants for their continuing loyalty to our
Company.       L  LOYD   J. S  HULMAN    Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   1. SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:   
   Consolidation   
  The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company, a New York corporation and its
subsidiaries (J. W. M. Realty Corp. and Dutchess Mall Sewage Plant, Inc.), which
are wholly-owned. Material intercompany items have been eliminated in
consolidation.  
   Accounting Records and
Use of Estimates   
  The accounting records are
maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( GAAP ). The preparation of the Company s financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The estimates that we make include allowance for doubtful
accounts, depreciation and amortization, income tax assets and liabilities, fair
value of marketable securities, revenue recognition and accrued expenses.
Estimates are based on historical experience where applicable or other
assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due
to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results may
differ from those estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.  
   Rental
Income   
  All of the real estate
owned by the Company is held for leasing to tenants except for a small portion
used for Company offices. Rent is recognized from tenants under executed leases
no later than on an established date or on an earlier date if the tenant should
commence conducting business. Unbilled receivables represent the excess of
scheduled rental income recognized on a straight-line basis over rental income
as it becomes receivable according to the provisions of the lease. Contingent
rental income is recorded when earned and is not based on tenant revenue. The
effect of lease modifications that result in rent relief or other credits to
tenants, including any retroactive effects relating to prior periods, is
recognized in the period when the lease modification is signed. At the time of
the lease modification, we assess the realizability of any accrued but unpaid
rent and amounts that had been recognized as revenue in prior periods. If the
amounts are not determined to be realizable, the accrued but unpaid rent is
written off.  
  Based upon its periodic
assessment of the quality of the receivables, management, using its historical
knowledge of the tenants and industry experience, determines whether a reserve
or write-off is required. Management has determined that no allowance for
uncollected receivables is considered necessary. The Company uses specific
identification to write-off receivables to bad debt expense in the period when
issues of collectability become known. Collectability issues include
circumstances when a tenant indicates their intention to vacate the property
without paying, or when tenant litigation or bankruptcy proceedings are not
expected to result in full payment. Due to the early termination of two leases
and the modification without extension of a third lease, the Company recorded a
bad debt expense of $66,265 for the year ended July 31, 2014, which is included
in administrative and general expenses.  
   Property and
Equipment   
  Property and equipment are
stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and
the declining-balance method. Amortization of improvements to leased property is
calculated over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful
life of the improvements. Lives used to determine depreciation and amortization
are generally as follows:  

9  

Maintenance, repairs,
renewals and improvements of a non-permanent nature are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for additions and major renewals or improvements are
capitalized along with the associated interest cost during construction. The
cost of assets sold or retired and the accumulated depreciation or amortization
thereon are eliminated from the respective accounts in the year of disposal, and
the resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income. Capitalized
interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized
over the asset s estimated useful life.  
  The Company reviews
long-lived assets for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change
such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered.
At July 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no impairments of its property and
equipment.  
   Deferred
Charges   
  Deferred charges consist
principally of costs incurred in connection with the leasing of property to
tenants. Such costs are amortized over the related lease periods, ranging from 1
to 21 years, using the straight-line method. If a lease is terminated early,
such costs are expensed.  
   Income
Taxes   
  Deferred income taxes are
provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and
the tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
result principally from the recording of certain accruals, reserves and net
operating loss carry forward which currently are not deductible for tax
purposes. Deferred tax liabilities result principally from temporary differences
in the recognition of gains and losses from certain investments and from the
use, for tax purposes, of accelerated depreciation. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset for each jurisdiction and are presented net on the balance sheet.  
  The effect on deferred
income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates
due to future changes in income tax law or results from the final review of tax
returns by federal, state or city tax authorities. Financial statement effects
on tax positions are recognized in the period in which it is more likely than
not that the position will be sustained upon examination, the position is
effectively settled or when the statute of limitations to challenge the position
has expired. Interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax
benefits are recorded as interest expense and administrative and general
expenses, respectively.  
   Income Per Share of
Common Stock   
  Income per share has been
computed by dividing net income for the year by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the year, adjusted for the purchase of
treasury stock. Shares used in computing income per share were 2,015,780 in
fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014.  
   Marketable
Securities   
  The Company categorizes
marketable securities as either trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity
at the time of purchase. Trading securities are carried at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses included in income. Available-for-sale securities
are carried at fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a
separate component of shareholders  equity. Held-to-maturity securities are
carried at amortized cost. Dividends and interest income are accrued as earned.
Realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis. The
Company reviews marketable securities for impairment whenever circumstances and
situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may
not be recovered. The Company did not classify any securities as trading or held
to maturity during the three years ended July 31, 2016.  
  The Company follows GAAP
which establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the valuation
techniques and creates the following three broad levels, with Level 1 valuation
being the highest priority:       

   Level
1 valuation    inputs are quoted
market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are
accessible at the measurement date (e.g., equity securities traded on the New
York Stock Exchange).  
   Level 2
valuation    inputs are from other
than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indirectly (e.g., quoted market prices of
similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted market prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
active).  
   Level 3
valuation    inputs are unobservable
(e.g., an entity s own data) and should be used to measure fair value to the
extent that observable inputs are not available.  
  10  

Following is a description
of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a
recurring basis. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at July
31, 2016 and 2015.  
   Equity
securities    are valued at the
closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities
are traded that the Company has access to.  
   Mutual
funds    are valued at the daily
closing price as reported by the fund. Mutual funds held by the Company are
open-end mutual funds that are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value
( NAV ) and to transact at that price. The mutual funds held by the Company are
deemed to be actively traded.  
  In accordance with the
provisions of Fair Value Measurements, the following are the Company s financial
assets measured on a recurring basis presented at fair value.  
  
   Fair Value of
Investments in Entities that Use NAV   
  The following table
summarizes investments measured at fair value based on NAV per share as of July
31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  
   Reclassifications:   
  The consolidated financial
statements for prior years reflect certain reclassifications to conform with
classifications adopted in 2016. These reclassifications have no effect on net
income or loss as previously reported.  
   Implementation of new
accounting standards:   
  In April 2014, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update
(ASU) 2014-08,  Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and
Equipment: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of
Components of an Entity.  Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals that represent a
strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity s results
and operations would qualify as discontinued operations. In addition, ASU
2014-08 expands the disclosure requirements for disposals that meet the
definition of a discontinued operation and requires entities to disclose
information about disposals for individually significant components that do not
meet the definition of discontinued operations. The Company adopted ASU 2014-08
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. The adoption of this
standard did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial
statements.  
  In January 2015, the FASB
issued ASU 2015-01,  Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items:
Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of
Extraordinary Items.  Under ASU 2015-01, all transactions will be treated as
ordinary and usual revenues or expenses in the presentation of operating
results. The criteria for special presentation of an item as extraordinary has
been removed from accounting standards. The Company adopted ASU 2015-01 in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. The adoption of this standard
did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial
statements.  
  11  

In April 2015, the FASB
issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 and applied retroactively to
July 31, 2015. The adoption of this standard caused a reclassification in the
consolidated balance sheet for 2015 whereby deferred financing costs which were
presented as deferred charges are now presented as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums.
The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the consolidated
statements of income and retained earnings, comprehensive income, or cash
flows.  
  In May 2015, the FASB
issued ASU 2015-07,  Fair Value Measurement: Disclosures for Investments in
Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Equivalent).  The
Company applied ASU 2015-07 in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended July
31, 2016 and applied retroactively to July 31, 2015. The standard removes the
requirement to categorize investments measured at Net Asset Value which are
redeemable with the investee at a future date (including periodic redemption
dates) within the fair value hierarchy. The adoption of this standard did not
have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
  In November 2015, the FASB
issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  The
Company applied ASU 2015-17 in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended July
31, 2016 and applied retroactively to July 31, 2015. The adoption of this
standard caused a reclassification in the consolidated balance sheet for 2015
whereby all deferred taxes are classified as noncurrent in a classified balance
sheet. In addition, the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each taxing jurisdiction are presented net on the balance sheet. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the consolidated
statements of income and retained earnings, comprehensive income, or cash
flows.  
   Recently issued
accounting standards not yet adopted:   
  In May 2014, the FASB
issued 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 )
establishing ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09
establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for
revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the
existing revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to
recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain
additional disclosures. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual
reporting in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2016. ASU 2015-14
extended the implementation date for fiscal years beginning after December 31,
2017. The adoption of the update on August 1, 2018 is not expected to have a
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.   
  In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) 
( ASU 2016-08 ) which is intended to improve the operability and
understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent
considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ) which provides further guidance on identifying
performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of
the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ) which narrowly amended
the revenue recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash
consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition. ASU 2016-08, ASU
2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 have the same effective date and transition requirements
as ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.  
  In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.  ASU 2016-02 is intended to increase transparency
and comparability among organizations of accounting for leasing arrangements.
This guidance establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record
a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases
with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either
finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense
recognition in the income statement. Lessor accounting remains similar to the
current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and
the new revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2016-02 offers specific
accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions.
Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative
information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial
statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from leases. Entities will be required to recognize and measure leases as of the
earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The standard
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The new standard will be effective
for the Company for the fiscal year beginning August 1, 2019. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the
new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

  As of July 31, 2016 and
2015, the Company s marketable securities were classified as follows:  
  
  The Company s debt and
equity securities, gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by

follows:  

Investment income for the
years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 consists of the following:  

3. LONG-TERM
DEBT MORTGAGE:   
  
  The Company, on August 19,
2004, closed a loan with a bank for a $12,000,000 multiple draw term loan. The
loan consisted of: a) a permanent, first mortgage loan to refinance an existing
first mortgage loan affecting the Fishkill, New York property, which matured on
July 1, 2004 (the  First Permanent Loan ), b) a permanent subordinate mortgage
loan in the amount of $1,870,000 (the  Second Permanent Loan ), and c) multiple,
successively subordinate loans in the amount $8,295,274 ( Subordinate Building
Loans ). The Company, in February 2008, converted the loan totaling $12,000,000
to a seven (7) year permanent mortgage loan. The interest rate on conversion was
6.98%. On January 9, 2015, the Company refinanced the loan for $6,000,000,
which included the outstanding balance as of January 2015 in the amount of
$5,347,726 and an additional borrowing of $652,274. The loan is for a period of
five years with a payment based on a twenty-five year amortization period. The
interest rate for this period is fixed at 3.54% per annum. The mortgage loan is
secured by the Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York.  
  Maturities of long-term
mortgage and term loan payable outstanding at July 31, 2016 are as follows:
Years ending July 31, 2017 (included in current liabilities): $156,846; 2018:
$162,569; 2019: $168,500; and 2020: $5,298,610.  
  The carrying value of all
properties collateralizing the above debt is $21,805,611 at July 31,
2016.  
  13  

4. INCOME
TAXES:   
  Income taxes provided for
the years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 consist of the
following:  

Taxes provided for the
years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 differ from amounts which would result
from applying the federal statutory tax rate to pre-tax income, as
follows:  

On September 13, 2013, the
U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released final
income tax regulations on the deduction and capitalization of expenditures
related to tangible property ( tangible property regulations ). The tangible
property regulations clarify and expand sections 162(a) and 263(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ), which relate to amounts paid to acquire, produce,
or improve tangible property. Additionally, the tangible property regulations
provided final guidance under IRC section 167 regarding accounting for and
retirement of depreciable property and regulations under IRC section 168
relating to the accounting for property under the Modified Accelerated Cost
Recovery System. The tangible property regulations affect all taxpayers that
acquire, produce, or improve tangible property, and generally apply to taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. The Company implemented the
tangible property regulations as of August 1, 2014 with the filing of its
federal tax return due October 15, 2015.  
  For the year ended July 31,
2016, after implementing the tangible property regulations, the Company incurred
a federal net operating loss of approximately $8,191,000. The Company was able
to carryback approximately $1,582,000, generating a federal income tax refund
receivable of $537,881. The remaining federal net operating loss approximating
$6,609,000 and $6,576,000 as of July 31, 2015 and July 31, 2016, respectively, is
available to offset future taxable income. In addition, as of July 31, 2015 and
2016, the Company had state and city net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $9,000,000 and $8,943,000, respectively, available to offset
future state and city taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards will
begin to expire, if not used, in 2035.  
  The Company s federal tax
returns have been audited through the year ended July 31, 2013 and the New York
State and New York City tax returns have been audited through July 31,
2012.  
  Generally, tax returns
filed are subject to audit for three years by the appropriate taxing
jurisdictions. The statute of limitations in each of the state jurisdictions in
which the Company operates remain open until the years are settled for federal
income tax purposes, at which time amended state income tax returns reflecting
all federal income tax adjustments are filed. As of July 31, 2016, there were no
income tax audits in progress that would have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.  
  14  

Significant components of
the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of July 31, 2016 and 2015
are a result of temporary differences related to the items described as
follows:  
 
  Management periodically
assesses the realization of its net deferred tax assets by evaluating all
available evidence, both positive and negative, associated with the Company and
determining whether, based on the weight of that associated evidence, a
valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is needed. Based on this
analysis, management has determined that it is more likely than not that future
taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the federal deferred tax
assets at July 31, 2016 and 2015.  
  New York State and New York
City taxes for years through July 31, 2015 are calculated using the higher of
taxes based on income or the respective capital-based franchise taxes. In April
2014, the New York State governor signed into law legislation overhauling the
New York State franchise tax on corporations. The changes in the law will be
effective for the Company s year ending July 31, 2016. The state capital-based
tax will be phased out over a 7-year period. As of July 2015, the Company
anticipates New York State taxes will be based on capital through 2022, and New
York City taxes will be based on capital for the foreseeable future. Capital
based franchise taxes are recorded to administrative and general
expense.  
  Due to the application of
the capital-based tax while the net operating loss still applies, or due to the
possible absence of State taxable income in the years beyond 2022 to which the
State loss can be carried, the Company has not recorded the New York State or
New York City tax benefit of its net operating loss carryforwards. Also, to
reflect its expectation that reversal of temporary differences will not result
in New York State or City tax based on income, as of July 31, 2016 the Company
decreased the deferred tax asset, deferred tax liability, and deferred taxes on
unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities by $380,000, $771,000 and
$26,000, respectively, resulting in a State and City deferred tax benefit of
$365,000.  
  Components of the deferred
tax provision (benefit) for the years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 consist
of the following:  

15  

5.
LEASES:   
  The Company s real estate
operations encompass both owned and leased properties. The current leases on
leased property, most of which have options to extend the terms, range from 5
years to 27 years. Certain of the leases provide for additional rentals under
certain circumstances and obligate the Company for payments of real estate taxes
and other expenses.  
  Rental expense for leased
real property for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended July 31,
2016 was exceeded by sublease rental income, as follows:  

Rent expense related to an
affiliate principally owned by a director of the Company totaled $836,813 for
fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 and $825,000 for fiscal years ended 2015 and
2014. The rent expense is derived from two leases which expire July 31, 2027 and
April 30, 2031, respectively. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lives of the leases.  
  Future minimum
non-cancelable rental commitments for operating leases with initial or remaining
terms of one year or more are payable as follows:  

*       
      Minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease
      rentals of $30,480,467 under operating leases due in the future under
      non-cancelable leases.     
   6. RENTAL
INCOME:   
  Rental income for each of
the fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:  

16  

Future minimum
non-cancelable rental income for leases with initial or remaining terms of one
year or more is as follows:  

Rental income is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lives of the leases.  
   7. PAYROLL AND OTHER
ACCRUED LIABILITIES:   
  Payroll and other accrued
liabilities for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 consist of the
following:  

8. EMPLOYEES  RETIREMENT
PLANS:   
  The Company sponsors a
non-contributory Money Purchase Plan covering substantially all of its non-union
employees. Operations were charged $391,962, $385,083, and $366,741, as
contributions to the Plan for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.  
   MULTI-EMPLOYER
PLAN:   
  The Company contributes to
a union sponsored multi-employer pension plan covering its union employees. The
Company contributions to the pension plan for the years ended July 31, 2016,
2015 and 2014 were $53,405, $45,782, and $47,903, respectively. Contributions
and costs are determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor
contracts or terms of the plans. The Company also contributes to union sponsored
health benefit plans.  
  Information as to the
Company s portion of accumulated plan benefits and plan assets is not reported
separately by the pension plan. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act, upon withdrawal from a multi-employer benefit plan, an employer is required
to continue to pay its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested
benefits, if any. Any liability under this provision cannot be determined:
however, the Company has not made a decision to withdraw from the
plan.

   9. CASH FLOW
INFORMATION:   
  For purposes of reporting
cash flows, the Company considers cash equivalents to consist of short-term
highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, which are
readily convertible into cash.  
  Supplemental
disclosures:  

10. FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS AND CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS:   
  The following disclosure of
estimated fair value was determined by the Company using available market
information and appropriate valuation methods. Considerable judgment is
necessary to develop estimates of fair value. The estimates presented herein are
not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon
disposition of the financial instruments.  
  The Company estimates the
fair value of its financial instruments using the following methods and
assumptions: (i) quoted market prices, when available, are used to estimate the
fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities; (ii)
discounted cash flow analyses are used to estimate the fair value of long-term
debt, using the Company s estimate of current interest rates for similar debt;
and (iii) carrying amounts in the balance sheet approximate fair value for cash
and cash equivalents and tenant security deposits due to their high
liquidity.  

Financial instruments that
are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents. Marketable securities and
cash and cash equivalents are placed with multiple financial institutions and
instruments to minimize risk. No assurance can be made that such financial
institutions and instruments will minimize all such risk.  
  Other assets subject to
credit risk include receivables and unbilled receivables. The Company derived
rental income from forty nine tenants, of which one tenant accounted for 18.98%
and another tenant accounted for 15.73% of rental income during the year ended
July 31, 2016. No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of rental income
during the year ended July 31, 2016. Of the receivables recorded at July 31,
2016, one tenant accounted for 11.35% of the receivables due to a restructuring
of the payments   
  18  

due on leases and three
other tenants accounted for 12.48%, 32.60% and 11.53% of the receivables,
respectively. Of the unbilled receivables, one tenant accounted for 39.21%, a
second tenant accounted for 16.58% and a third tenant accounted for 15.79% of
the balance at July 31, 2016. No other tenants accounted for more than 10% of
billed receivables, unbilled receivables, or combined billed and unbilled
receivables. Write- offs of unbilled receivables, primarily due to restructuring
of leases, were $0 for 2016, $0 for 2015 and $66,265 for 2014.  
  The Company has one
irrevocable letter of credit totaling $230,000 at July 31, 2016 and 2015
provided by one tenant as a security deposit.  
   11. DEFERRED
CHARGES:   
  Deferred charges for the
fiscal years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 consist of the following:  
  
  The aggregate amortization
expense for the three years in the period ended July 31, 2016 was $315,779,
$331,700, and $451,924, respectively.  
  The weighted average life
of current year additions to deferred charges was 5 years.  
  The estimated aggregate
amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as
follows:  

12.
CAPITALIZATION:   
  The Company is capitalized
entirely through common stock with identical voting rights and rights to
liquidation. Treasury stock is recorded at cost and consists of 162,517 shares
at July 31, 2016 and at July 31, 2015.  
   13. NOTE
PAYABLE:   
  On December 15, 2004, the
Company borrowed $1,000,000 on an unsecured basis from a former director of the
Company, who at the time was also a greater than 10% beneficial owner of the
outstanding common stock of the Company. The former director passed away in
November 2012 and the note had been an asset of the estate of the former
director. In connection with the distribution of the assets of such estate, the
note has been assigned to the trust under the will of the former director for
the benefit of the formers director s granddaughter. The loan has been
repeatedly renewed to its current maturity date of December 15, 2016 at an
interest rate of 5% per annum. The note is prepayable in whole or in part at any
time without penalty. The constant quarterly payment of interest is $12,500. The
interest paid for each of the three years ended July 31, 2016 was $50,000 each
year.  
  19  

14. ACCUMULATED OTHER
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME:   
  The only component of
accumulated other comprehensive income is unrealized gains (losses) on
available-for-sale securities.  
  A summary of the changes in
accumulated other comprehensive income for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016,
2015, and 2014 is as follows:

   15. ENTRY INTO A
MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT:   
  On June 16, 2014, the
Company entered into a Second Amendment of Lease (the "Amendment") with 33 Bond
St. LLC ("Bond"), its landlord, for certain truck bays and approximately 1,000
square feet located at the cellar level within a garage at Livingston and Bond
Street ("Premises"). Pursuant to the Amendment, (1) a lease option for the
Premises was exercised extending the lease until December 8, 2043, (2) the
Company, simultaneously with the execution of the Amendment, vacated the
Premises so that Bond may demolish the building in which the Premises is located
in order to develop and construct a new building at the location, and (3) Bond
agreed to redeliver to the Company possession of the reconfigured Premises after
construction.  
  As consideration under the
Amendment, Bond agreed to pay the Company a total of $3,500,000. Upon execution
of the Amendment, the Company recorded $3,500,000 to deferred revenue to be
amortized to revenue to temporarily vacate the premises over the expected vacate
period of 36 months. Bond tendered $2,250,000 simultaneously with the execution
of the Amendment, and the balance due of $1,250,000 on June 16, 2015 had been
received by the Company.  
  In connection with the
Amendment, the parties also agreed to settle a pending lawsuit in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, Kings County, Index No. 50796/13 (the "Action"),
in which the Company sought, among other things, a declaratory judgment that it
validly renewed the lease for the Premises, and Bond sought, among other things,
a declaratory judgment that the lease expired by its terms on December 8, 2013.
Pursuant to a stipulation of settlement, filed on June 16, 2014, the Action,
including all claims and counterclaims, has been discontinued with prejudice,
without costs or attorneys' fees to any party as against the other. The
stipulation of settlement also contains general releases by both parties of all
claims.  
   16.
CONTINGENCIES:   
  There are various lawsuits
and claims pending against the Company. It is the opinion of management that the
resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  If the Company sells,
transfers, disposes of or demolishes 25 Elm Place, Brooklyn, New York, then the
Company may be liable to create a condominium unit for the loading dock. The
necessity of creating the condominium unit and the cost of such condominium unit
cannot be determined at this time.  
  20  

Because of defective
workmanship and breach of contract, the Company commenced litigation against a
contractor to pay damages and return in full $376,467 of a deposit paid when
work commenced to replace a roof on the Fishkill, New York building. As of July
31, 2015, this deposit was included in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheet in security deposits. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this
matter and expects to vigorously pursue this contractor until the deposit is
returned and damages are paid. As there is a reasonable possibility the
contractor will not pay the Company in full, a charge to real estate operating
expenses in the amount of $279,213 was recorded as of July 31, 2016, the
difference between the deposit amount when work commenced and outstanding
invoices due to the contractor.  
   17. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   
  During the year, the
Company changed its accounting policy with respect to the presentation of
deferred financing costs. The Company now presents the deferred financing costs
as an offset to the face value of the long-term debt. Prior to this change in
policy, the Company included deferred financing costs as a component of deferred
charges.  
  The Company believes the
new policy is preferable as it implements the change in accounting standards
required by ASU 2015-03 which is required effective with the year ending July
31, 2017.  
  The impact of this
voluntary change in accounting policy on the consolidated financial statements
is primarily to reduce deferred charges and face value of outstanding long-term
debt. This change did not result in a material impact on the current year or any
years included within these consolidated financial statements.  
  During the year, the
Company changed its accounting policy with respect to the presentation of
deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company now presents the deferred tax assets and liabilities
as a net long-term liability. Prior to this change in policy, the Company included
deferred tax liabilities as a separate line item between long-term liabilities and current
liabilities.  
  The Company believes the
new policy is preferable as it implements the change in accounting standards
required by ASU 2015-17 which is required effective with the year ending July
31, 2018. This change did not result in a material impact on the current year or any years
included within these consolidated financial statements.  
  The impact on each line item of the primary financial statements relating to the Company s adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-17 is as follows:  

The total effect on the
consolidated balance sheet totals is as follows:  

18. SUBSEQUENT
EVENT:   
  In August 2016, a tenant at
the Company s Circleville, Ohio Property leased an additional 12,000 square feet
of warehouse space effective August 15, 2016.

   REPORT OF
MANAGEMENT   
  Management is responsible
for the preparation and reliability of the financial statements and the other
financial information in this Annual Report. Management has established systems
of internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the financial records used for preparing financial statements are
reliable and reflect the transactions of the Company and that established
policies and procedures are carefully followed. The Company reviews, modifies
and improves its system of internal controls in response to changes in
operations.  
  The Board of Directors,
acting through the Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of independent
directors who are not employees of the Company, oversees the financial reporting
process. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America and
include amounts based on judgments and estimates made by management. Actual
results could differ from estimated amounts.  
  To ensure complete
independence, D Arcangelo   Co., LLP, the independent registered public
accounting firm, has full and free access to meet with the Audit Committee,
without management representatives present, to discuss results of the audit, the
adequacy of internal controls and the quality of financial reporting.

INC.   
   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   
  To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders   J.W. Mays, Inc.
and Subsidiaries  
  We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of J.W. Mays, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of July 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income and
retained earnings, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
the three year period ended July 31, 2016. J.W. Mays, Inc. and subsidiaries
management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.  
  We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.  
  In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of J.W. Mays, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of July 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the years in the three year period ended July 31, 2016, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

this report. In this discussion, the words  Company ,  we ,  our  and  us  refer
to J.W. Mays, Inc. and subsidiaries.  
   FORWARD LOOKING
STATEMENTS   
  The following can be
interpreted as including forward-looking statements under the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words  outlook ,  intend ,  plans ,
 efforts ,  anticipates ,  believes ,  expects  or words of similar import
typically identify such statements. Various important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking
statements are identified under the heading  Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements  below. Our actual results may vary significantly
from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements based on a
number of factors including, but not limited to, availability of labor,
marketing success, competitive conditions and the change in economic conditions
of the various markets we serve.  
   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   
  Critical accounting
policies are defined as those most important to the portrayal of a company s
financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported
amount of revenues, and expenses during the reporting period and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the critical
accounting policies in Note 1 affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Estimates are
based on historical experience, where applicable or other assumptions that
management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. We have identified
the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. (See
Note 1 on pages 9 through 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Newly
effective accounting principles and recently issued accounting principles not
yet adopted are also disclosed in Note 1.  
   Revenue
Recognition   
  Substantially all of our
revenue is recognized pursuant to the terms of long-term leases which usually
range from 5 years to 20 years. Most of the leases provide for increases in
fixed monthly rental income over the term of the lease. Accounting principles
require us to recognize the rental income on a straight-line basis over the term
of the lease; therefore during the first half of the lease period we recognize
more rental income than is received from the tenant pursuant to the terms of the
lease. The difference between the rental income recorded in the financial
statements and the amounts due under the terms of the lease is recorded as
unbilled receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. During the second half
of the lease period, we recognize less rental income than is received from the
tenant pursuant to the terms of the lease thereby reducing the amount of
unbilled receivables. Modifications are sometimes made to the leases during the
lease term which would affect the rental income recorded.  
   Receivables   
  Receivables, both billed
and unbilled, are reviewed monthly for collectability. Management, based on
available information, will make a decision as to whether the receivable is
collectable. If circumstances indicate that a tenant will not be able to fulfill
the terms of the lease, the unbilled receivable will be written off and revenue
will be recorded as received.  
   Property and
equipment   
  Property and equipment is
recorded at cost and depreciated over the asset s useful life. Significant
improvements to the property are capitalized and the costs of improvements no
longer in use are written off. Management reviews the value of the properties
for significant decreases in valuation. If any significant decreases in
valuation are noted, the adjustment is recorded in the financial
statements.  
  25  

Deferred
charges   
  In connection with
obtaining new tenants and leases, we incur costs including brokerage commissions
and legal fees. These costs are written off over the term of the lease on the
straight-line basis. Should a tenant vacate prior to the expiration of the
lease, the unamortized cost is written off at that time.  
   Income
taxes   
  Our income tax expense
takes into effect taxes that are currently payable based on our income tax
returns filed and taxes that will be payable in the future based on income
earned in the current year that is not taxable until future events occur offset
by expenses incurred in the current year that are not deductible until future
events occur. Tax audits increase or decrease the amounts currently payable
based on the results of the audits. The tax provision is an estimate and can
change at any time due to changes in tax laws and tax rates.  
   Marketable
securities   
  We invest in mutual funds
with our extra available cash. The mutual funds are valued daily by the funds
based on the assets included within the funds. Our mutual fund investments are
recorded in the consolidated financial statements at the daily value established
by the mutual funds and we can liquidate our investments at any time. Our
investments in corporate equity securities are valued at prices established on
the various stock exchanges. We can liquidate these investments at any time. Our
investment valuations are subject to market fluctuations and can substantially
change in value at any time.  
   FISCAL 2016 COMPARED TO
FISCAL 2015   
  Net income for the year
ended July 31, 2016 amounted to $1,517,760, or $.75 per share, compared to net
income for the year ended July 31, 2015 of $2,208,682, or $1.10 per
share.  
  Revenues in the current
year decreased to $18,582,854 from $18,909,777 in the comparable 2015 year
primarily due to non-payment of rent from a retail tenant, at the Nine Bond
Street building in Brooklyn, New York, who vacated the building in December
2015, partially offset by a new office tenant at the same building and increased
rent from existing tenants.  
  Real estate operating
expenses in the current year increased to $10,080,913 from $9,658,282 in the
comparable 2015 year primarily due to increases in real estate taxes,
maintenance costs, payroll costs and a charge for litigation against a
contractor in the amount of $279,213 (see Note 16), partially offset by
decreases in utility costs and licenses and permits.  
  Administrative and general
expenses in the current year increased to $4,356,461 from $4,342,762 in the
comparable 2015 year primarily due to increases in New York State and New York
City capital based franchise taxes, partially offset by a decrease in legal and
professional costs.  
  Depreciation and
amortization expense in the current year decreased to $1,635,660 from $1,695,454
in the comparable 2015 year primarily due to expiring depreciation on the
Fishkill, New York building.  
  There was a $500 gain on
disposition of property and equipment in the year ended July 31, 2016 versus a
loss of $27,648 in the comparable period in 2015.  
  Interest expense in the
current year exceeded investment income by $196,560 and by $263,949 in the
comparable 2015 year. The decrease was due to a lower interest expense from a
more favorable interest rate on the refinanced mortgage with a bank in the 2015
year and lower capitalized interest expense, partially offset by a loss on the
sale of securities in the 2016 year.  
   FISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO
FISCAL 2014   
  Net income for the year
ended July 31, 2015 amounted to $ 2,208,682, or $1.10 per share, compared to net
income for the year ended July 31, 2014 of $739,323, or $.37 per
share.  
  Revenues in the year ended
2015 increased to $18,909,777 from $17,081,430 in the comparable 2014 year
primarily due to revenue from an agreement to temporarily vacate a lease, one
new office tenant at the Nine Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York, two
new retail tenants at the Jamaica, New York building at higher rents and a new
tenant at the Company s Fishkill, New York building.  
  26  

Real estate operating
expenses in the year ended 2015 increased to $9,658,282 from $ 9,628,631 in the
comparable 2014 year primarily due to increases in real estate taxes, payroll
costs and insurance costs, partially offset by a decrease in maintenance costs,
utility costs, leasing commissions and a bad debt expense in the amount of
$66,265 from a tenant that vacated the Massapequa, New York property in the 2014
year.  
  Administrative and general
expenses in the year ended 2015 increased to $4,342,762 from $4,255,631 in the
comparable 2014 year primarily due to increases in payroll costs, insurance
costs, medical costs and pension costs, partially offset by decreases in legal
and professional costs. Additionally, New York State and New York City capital
based franchise taxes of $229,943 were included in 2015, which there were none
in the comparable 2014 year.  
  Depreciation and
amortization expense in the year ended 2015 decreased to $1,695,454 from
$1,721,850 in the comparable 2014 year primarily due to expiring depreciation on
the Fishkill, New York building, partially offset by improvements to the Nine
Bond Street, Brooklyn, New York building.  
  The year ended 2015 had a
loss on disposition of property and equipment in the amount of $27,648. The 2014
year had a loss on disposition of property and equipment in the amount of
$4,291.  
  Interest expense in the
year ended 2015 exceeded investment income by $263,949 and by $190,704 in the
comparable 2014 year. The increase was due to a gain on sale of marketable
securities in the 2014 year, offset by scheduled repayments of debt and a lower
interest expense due to a lower interest rate on the refinanced mortgage with a
bank in the 2015 year.  
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES   
  Management considers
current working capital and borrowing capabilities adequate to cover the
Company s planned operating and capital requirements. The Company s cash and
cash equivalents amounted to $5,228,826 at July 31, 2016.  
  In November 2014, the
Company entered into a lease agreement with an existing tenant to occupy an
additional 5,640 square feet of office space at the Jowein building in Brooklyn,
New York. Occupancy and rent commenced in December 2015 and February 2016,
respectively.  
  In May 2015, the Company
entered into a 20 year lease agreement with a new tenant (cancellation clause
after the 10th year) to occupy 17,425 square feet of office space at the Jowein
building in Brooklyn, New York. Occupancy and rent is anticipated to commence in
November 2016 and February 2017, respectively. The amount of brokerage

2020.  
  A tenant who occupies 2,000
square feet of office space at its Jamaica, New York building, terminated its
lease as of December 31, 2015. In July 2016, the Company leased these premises
to an existing tenant at an increased rental.  
  The Company was in
litigation with a retail tenant who occupied 7,401 square feet at its Nine Bond
Street Brooklyn, New York building for non-payment of rent since June 2015. The
tenant vacated the premises in December 2015. The Company has only accrued rent
in the amount of the security deposit held, which is two months  rent. The loss
in rents is approximately $450,000 per annum. The Company is actively seeking
through brokers, tenants to occupy the space.  
  In March 2016, the Company
extended a lease with a retail tenant who occupies 126,996 square feet at the
Company s Nine Bond Street Brooklyn, New York property. The original expiration
date was April 29, 2021 and was extended until January 31, 2036. The tenant also
has two five year option periods.  
  In April 2016, a tenant who
occupies 5,500 square feet of retail space at the Company s Jowein building in
Brooklyn, New York extended its lease for an additional five year period ending
on September 30, 2021.  
  In April 2016, the Company
extended a lease with an office tenant who occupies 11,128 square feet at the

date was April 29, 2021 and was extended until January 31, 2036. The tenant also
has two five year option periods.  
  In April 2016, the Company
extended a lease with a warehouse tenant who occupies 8,500 square feet at the
Company s Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York property. The original
expiration date was April 29, 2021 and was extended until January 31, 2036. The
tenant also has two five year option periods.  
  27  

In May 2016, an office
tenant who occupies 1,558 square feet at the Company s Nine Bond Street
Brooklyn, New York property extended its lease for an additional five year
period ending on July 31, 2021.  
  In July 2016, an office
tenant who occupies 13,460 square feet at the Company s Jowein building in
Brooklyn, New York extended its lease for an additional seven year period ending
June 30, 2023.  
  In August 2016, a tenant at
the Company s Circleville, Ohio property leased an additional 12,000 square feet
of warehouse space effective August 15, 2016.  
  Revenue recognized for the
temporary vacate of lease is expected to decrease in the year ending July 31,
2017 by approximately $146,000. The cash was received in prior years.

   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:   
  This section, Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, other
sections of the Annual Report on Form 10-K and this Annual Report to
Shareholders and other reports and verbal statements made by our representatives
from time to time may contain forward-looking statements that are based on our
assumptions, expectations and projections about us and the real estate industry.
These include statements regarding our expectations about revenues, our
liquidity, or expenses and our continued growth, among others. Such forward-
looking statements by their nature involve a degree of risk and uncertainty. We
caution that a variety of factors, including but not limited to the factors
described under Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2016 and the following, could cause business conditions and our
results to differ materially from what is contained in forward-looking
statements:  

changes in the rate of economic growth in the
      United States;  

changes in the financial condition of our
      customers;  

changes in regulatory environment;  

lease cancellations;  

changes in our estimates of costs;  

war and/or terrorist attacks on facilities
      where services are or may be provided;  

outcomes of pending and future
litigation;  

increasing competition by other
companies;  

compliance with our loan covenants;  

recoverability of claims against our customers
      and others by us and claims by third parties against us; and  

changes in estimates
      used in our critical accounting policies.      
  29  

Other factors and
assumptions not identified above were also involved in the formation of these
forward-looking statements and the failure of such other assumptions to be
realized, as well as other factors, may also cause actual results to differ
materially from those projected. Most of these factors are difficult to predict
accurately and are generally beyond our control. You should consider the areas
of risk described above in connection with any forward-looking statements that
may be made by us.  
  We undertake no obligation
to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult
any additional disclosures we make in proxy statements, Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed
with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
   CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES:   
  The Company s management
reviewed the Company s internal controls and procedures and the effectiveness of
these controls. As of July 31, 2016, the Company carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information
relating to the Company required to be included in its periodic SEC
filings.  
  There was no change in the
Company s internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors during
the Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial
reporting. There were no material weaknesses or significant deficiencies noted,
and therefore there were no corrective actions taken.
