  (Unaudited) 

References in   this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q   to "  DPS  " or "the   Company  " refer to Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. and all entities included in the   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements  .  
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refers   to some of   DPS  ' owned or licensed trademarks, trade names and service marks, which are referred to as the   Company  's brands. All of the product names included herein are either   DPS  ' registered trademarks or those of the   Company  's licensors. 
  BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The accompanying     unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements     have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("  U.S. GAAP  ")     for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by   U.S. GAAP   for complete consolidated financial statements  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting principally of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with     U.S. GAAP     requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.     These   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements   should be read in conjunction with the   Company  's audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in the   Company  's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ("Annual Report"). 
  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 
  DPS   consolidates all wholly owned subsidiaries. The   Company   uses the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the   Company   with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee. Consolidated net income includes DPS' proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.  
  The   Company   is also required to consolidate entities that are variable interest entities (   VIE  s ) of which   DPS   is the primary beneficiary. Judgments are made in assessing whether the   Company   is the primary beneficiary, including determination of the activities that most significantly impact the   VIE   s economic performance.  
  The   Company   eliminates from its financial results all intercompany transactions between entities included in the   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements     and the intercompany transactions with its equity method investees. 
  USE OF ESTIMATES 
  The process of preparing     DPS  '     unaudited condensed consolidated     financial statements in conformity with     U.S. GAAP     requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions the     Company     believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are revised when necessary. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period of change. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. 
  The following critical accounting estimates are discussed in greater detail in our Annual Report  : 
     goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets; 
     revenue recognition; 
     pension benefits; 
     risk management programs; and 
     income taxes.

RECLASSIFICATIONS 
  Capital lease payments have been reclassified from other, net to the capital lease payments caption within the financing activities section in the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Statements of Cash Flows for the prior period to conform to the current period's presentation, with no impact to total cash provided by (used in) operating, investing or financing activities. This reclassification within the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Statements of Cash Flows also resulted in corresponding changes to the prior period presentation in Note   16  . 
  Unrealized gains and losses on derivatives have been reclassified from other, net to the unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives caption within the operating activities section in the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Statements of Cash Flows for the prior period to conform to the current period's presentation, with no impact to total cash provided by (used in) operating, investing or financing activities.  
  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("  FASB  ") issued Accounting Standards Update ("  ASU  ") 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ("  ASU 2014-09  "). The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in   U.S. GAAP  . The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance.   ASU 2014-09   provides alternative methods of initial adoption. 
  In August 2015, the FASB issued   ASU 2015-14  ,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date of   ASU 2014-09   by one year to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date and permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date. In March 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations for the new model. In April 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which clarifies the implementation guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing for the new model. In May 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which improves guidance on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. These updates are effective concurrently with Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09). 
  The   Company   is currently evaluating the impact that the above standards will have on the consolidated financial statements and does not plan to early adopt these ASUs. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . The ASU enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The update to the standard is effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  This guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or presentation of our financial statements. The Company will adopt this standard as of January 1, 2018. 
  In February 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ("ASU 2016-02"). The ASU replaces the prior lease accounting guidance in its entirety. The underlying principle of the new standard is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for substantially all leases, with an exception for leases with terms of less than twelve months. The standard also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The standard requires a modified retrospective approach, which includes several optional practical expedients. The   Company   is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09") as part of the FASB simplification initiative. The new standard provides for changes to accounting for stock compensation including 1) excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share based payment awards will be recognized as income tax expense in the reporting period in which they occur; 2) excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flow; 3) the option to elect to estimate forfeitures or account for them when they occur; and 4) an increase in the tax withholding requirements threshold to qualify for equity classification. The ASU is effective for public companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 is expected to impact the recording of income taxes in the Company's financial position and results of operations, as well as the operating and financing cash flows on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The magnitude of such impacts are dependent upon the Company s future grants of stock-based compensation, the Company s future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and the exercise behavior of the Company s option holders.  The Company will adopt this standard as of January 1, 2017. 
  In June 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13").  The standard provides for a new impairment model which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for most financial assets held. The ASU is effective for public companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. The   Company   is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)   ("ASU 2016-15"). The standard provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The ASU is effective for public companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The   Company   is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-15 will have on the consolidated financial statements.  
  RECENTLY ADOPTED PROVISIONS OF U.S. GAAP 
  As of January 1, 2016, the   Company   adopted ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,   on a prospective basis with no impact to the   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements  . 
  In March 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships   ("ASU 2016-05"). The ASU clarifies that a change in counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not require de-designation of that hedging relationship, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. ASU 2016-05 is effective for public companies for annual, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-05 may be adopted on either a prospective basis or a modified retrospective basis. The   Company   has adopted ASU 2016-05 as of March 31, 2016, on a prospective basis, with no impact to the   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements  . 
  In March 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-07,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   ("ASU 2016-07"). The ASU eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. ASU 2016-07 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The   Company   has adopted ASU 2016-07 as of March 31, 2016, on a prospective basis, with no impact to the   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements  .

("San Benedetto"), became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company as a result of the Company's agreement to purchase all of the outstanding shares of IEBM and EMA owned by San Benedetto. 
  The Company paid approximately   $15 million   in cash for all of the outstanding shares of IEBM and EMA owned by San Benedetto. The Company's equity interest in IEBM and EMA of   $10 million   was remeasured to fair value, which resulted in a non-taxable gain of   $5 million   which was recognized in the third quarter of 2016 and included in other operating (income) expense, net. 
  The acquisition was accounted for as a step-acquisition within a business combination, and the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values was recorded as goodwill.  
  The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class for the step-acquisition when the Company gained control:

In connection with this step-acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of   $8 million  , which is not deductible for tax purposes, to the Company's Latin America Beverages reporting unit.  
    
  Beginning in September 2016, IEBM's and EMA's results of operations were fully consolidated in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to September 2016, the Company's   50 percent   share of IEBM's and EMA's results of operations was reported in equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, net of tax, in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company has not presented pro forma results of operations or amounts of revenue and earnings since the acquisition date because the acquisition is not material to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Inventories 
     Inventories consisted of the following: 

Approximately   $171 million   and   $154 million   of the   Company  's inventory was accounted for under the   LIFO   method of accounting as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively. The reduction to   LIFO   cost reflects the excess of the current cost of   LIFO   inventories as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , over the amount at which these inventories were valued on the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Balance Sheets. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   LIFO   inventory liquidation increased the Company's gross profit by   $3 million   and   $5 million  , respectively. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , there was   no   LIFO inventory liquidation. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   LIFO   inventory liquidation increased the   Company  's gross profit by   $1 million  .

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT 
  On   August 10, 2016  , the   Company  's Board of Directors ("the Board") authorized the   Company   to issue up to   $2,000 million   of securities from time to time. Subsequently, the   Company   filed a "well-known seasoned issuer" shelf registration statement with the SEC, effective   September 2, 2016  , which registered an indeterminate amount of securities for future sales. As of   September 30, 2016  , the   Company   had issued   $400 million   of 2026 Notes under this shelf registration statement and   $1,600 million   of securities remained authorized to be issued. 
   
  6  .   Derivatives 
  DPS   is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: 
     interest rates; 
     foreign exchange rates; and 
             
    commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and fuels, which are recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative ("  SG A  ") expenses, respectively. 
     The   Company   manages these risks through a variety of strategies, including the use of interest rate contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, commodity forward and future contracts and supplier pricing agreements.   DPS   does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
  The   Company   formally designates and accounts for certain interest rate contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts that meet established accounting criteria under   U.S. GAAP   as either fair value or cash flow hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instruments is recorded, net of applicable taxes, in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ("  AOCL  "), a component of Stockholders' Equity in the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Balance Sheets. When net income is affected by the variability of the underlying transaction, the applicable offsetting amount of the gain or loss from the derivative instrument deferred in   AOCL   is reclassified to net income and is reported as a component of the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Statements of Income. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the effective change in the fair value of the instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized immediately in current-period earnings. For derivatives that are not designated or are de-designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss on the instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change. 
  Certain interest rate contracts qualify for the "shortcut" method of accounting for hedges under     U.S. GAAP  . Under the shortcut method, the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective and no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings. For all other designated hedges, t  he   Company   assesses whether the derivative instrument is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or variability of cash flows at the inception of the derivative contract.   DPS   measures hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis throughout the designated period.   Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument that do not effectively offset changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item throughout the designated hedge period are recorded in earnings each period. 
  If a fair value or cash flow hedge were to cease to qualify for hedge accounting, or were terminated, the derivatives would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled and hedge accounting would be discontinued prospectively. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in   AOCL   would be reclassified to earnings at that time.

INTEREST RATES    
  Fair Value Hedges 
  The   Company   is exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates and manages these risks through the use of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Any ineffectiveness is recorded as interest during the period incurred. The following table presents information regarding these interest rate swaps and the associated hedging relationships: 
   
 ____________________________ 
           (1) 
    The assessment of hedge effectiveness is made by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate with the cumulative changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap. 
              (2) 
    The impact to the carrying value includes the fair value of the hedges, basis adjustments and cumulative ineffectiveness related to the 2022 and 2038 Notes, and amortization of the interest rate swap associated with the 2038 Notes, which was de-designated in February 2015. 
     FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  The   Company  's Canadian and Mexican businesses purchase inventory through transactions denominated and settled in United States ("  U.S.  ") dollars, a currency different from the functional currency of the those businesses. These inventory purchases are subject to exposure from movements in exchange rates. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the   Company   utilized foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage the exposures resulting from changes in these foreign currency exchange rates. The intent of these foreign exchange contracts is to provide predictability in the   Company  's overall cost structure. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between   one   and   seven months   as of   September 30, 2016  . The   Company   had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts of   $18 million   and   $7 million   as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  COMMODITIES 
  Economic Hedges 
  DPS   centrally manages the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in its production process and transportation through forward and future contracts. The intent of these contracts is to provide a certain level of predictability in the   Company  's overall cost structure. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the   Company   held forward and future contracts that economically hedged certain of its risks. In these cases, a natural hedging relationship exists in which changes in the fair value of the instruments act as an economic offset to changes in the fair value of the underlying items. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in net income throughout the term of the derivative instrument and are reported in the same line item of the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Statements of Income as the hedged transaction. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized as a component of unallocated corporate costs until the   Company  's operating segments are affected by the completion of the underlying transaction, at which time the gain or loss is reflected as a component of the respective segment's operating profit ("  SOP  "). The total notional values of derivatives related to economic hedges of this type were   $255 million   and   $159 million   as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , respectively.

    Commodity contracts include both realized and unrealized gains and losses. 
     Refer to Note 9 for additional information   on the valuation of derivative instruments. The   Company   has exposure to credit losses from derivative instruments in an asset position in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. Historically,   DPS   has not experienced credit losses as a result of counterparty nonperformance. The   Company   selects and periodically reviews counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines and monitors the market position of the programs upon execution of a hedging transaction and at least on a quarterly basis.

7  .   Other Non-Current Assets and Other Non-Current Liabilities 
  The table below details the components of other non-current assets and other non-current liabilities: 
   
 ____________________________ 
           (1) 
    During the third quarter of 2016, the   Company   contributed   $7 million   to its U.S. pension plans. 
              (2) 
    During the first quarter of 2016, we negotiated a   $35 million   lump-sum settlement to fully extinguish the   Company  's multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability, which was paid in the second quarter of 2016. As a result of the payment in the second quarter of 2016, we recognized a   $21 million   gain on the extinguishment of this liability, which is included in   Other (income) expense, net  , within our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  
      
  8  .   Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 29.7% and 34.4%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 33.4% and 35.2%, respectively.  
  For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for income taxes included an income tax benefit of $17 million driven primarily by a restructuring of the ownership of our Canadian business. The income tax benefit includes a valuation allowance release of $11 million. 
   
  9  .   Fair Value    
  Under   U.S. GAAP  , fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.   U.S. GAAP   provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. The three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements is as follows: 
  Level 1   - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2   - Observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. 
  Level 3   - Valuations with one or more unobservable significant inputs that reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions.

The fair values of marketable securities are determined using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets based on the closing price as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of commodity forward and future contracts, interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts are determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets. The fair value of commodity forward and future contracts are valued using the market approach based on observable market transactions, primarily underlying commodities futures or physical index prices, at the balance sheet date. Interest rate swap contracts are valued using models based primarily on readily observable market parameters, such as London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates, for all substantial terms of the   Company  's contracts and credit risk of the counterparties. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are valued using quoted forward foreign exchange prices at the reporting date. Therefore, the   Company   has categorized these contracts as Level 2. 
  As of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the   Company   did not have any assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis without observable market values that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value (Level 3). 
  There were no transfers of financial instruments between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT INSTRUMENTS 
  The carrying values and estimated fair values of the   Company  's financial instruments that are not required to be measured at fair value in the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Balance Sheet are as follows: 
   
 ____________________________ 
           (1) 
    Cash equivalents are composed of certificates of deposit, time deposits and other interest-bearing investments with original maturity dates of three months or less. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. 
              (2) 
    The fair value amounts of long term debt were based on current market rates available to the   Company  . The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount that would be paid or received to retire all debt and related unamortized costs to be incurred at such date. The carrying amount includes the unamortized discounts and issuance costs on the issuance of debt and adjustments related to the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on the 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2038 Notes.   Refer to Note 6 for additional information   regarding derivatives. 
      
  10  .   Stock-Based Compensation 
  The   Company  's Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan of 2009 ( "  DPS Stock Plan  ") provides for various long-term incentive awards, including stock options, restricted stock units ("  RSU  s") and performance share units ("  PSU  s"). 
  Beginning in 2016,   RSU  s granted for certain participants in the   DPS Stock Plan   will vest ratably over three years. Outstanding   RSU  s granted prior to January 1, 2016 will continue to vest on a cliff schedule of three years.  
  Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in   SG A   expenses in the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Statements of Income. The components of stock-based compensation expense are presented below:

STOCK OPTIONS 
  The table below summarizes stock option activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $6 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted under the   DPS Stock Plan   that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.02 years  . 
  RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS       
  The table below summarizes   RSU   activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The fair value of     RSU  s is determined based on the number of units granted and the grant date price of the Company's common stock. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $43 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested   RSU  s granted under the   DPS Stock Plan   that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.03 years  . 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   598,775 shares   subject to previously granted   RSU  s vested. A majority of these vested   RSU  s were net share settled. The Company withheld   191,755 shares   based upon the Company's closing stock price on the vesting date to settle the employees' minimum statutory obligation for applicable income and other employment taxes. Subsequently, the Company remitted the required funds to the appropriate taxing authorities. 
  Total payments for the employees' tax obligations to the relevant taxing authorities were   $19 million   and   $22 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Statements of Cash Flows. These payments were used for tax withholdings related to the net share settlements of   RSU  s and dividend equivalent units ("  DEUs  "). These payments had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued on the vesting date and were recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.

PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS 
  The table below summarizes   PSU   activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The fair value of     PSU  s is determined based on the number of units granted and the grant date price of the Company's common stock. 
   
 ____________________________ 
           (1) 
    For   PSU  s which vested during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company awarded additional   PSU  s, as actual results measured at the end of the performance period exceeded target performance levels. 
        As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $12 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested   PSU  s granted under the   DPS Stock Plan   that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.13 years  . 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   345,000 units   subject to previously granted   PSU  s vested. A majority of these vested   PSU  s were net share settled. The Company withheld   119,084 shares   based upon the Company's closing stock price on the vesting date to settle the employees' minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes. Subsequently, the Company remitted the required funds to the appropriate taxing authorities. 
  Total payments for the employees' tax obligations to the relevant taxing authorities were   $12 million   and   $5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Statements of Cash Flows. These payments were used for tax withholdings related to the net share settlements of   PSU  s and   DEUs  . These payments had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued on the vesting date and were recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.

11  .   Earnings Per Share    
  Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities. The following table presents the basic and diluted EPS and the Company's basic and diluted shares outstanding: 

Stock options,   RSU  s,   PSU  s and   DEUs   totaling   0.3 million   and   0.4 million   shares were excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as they were not dilutive. Stock options,   RSU  s,   PSU  s and   DEUs   totaling   0.4 million   shares were excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as they were not dilutive. 
  Under the terms of our   RSU   and   PSU   agreements, unvested   RSU   and PSU awards contain forfeitable rights to dividends and   DEUs  . Because the   DEUs   are forfeitable, they are defined as non-participating securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   63,644     DEUs  , which will vest at the time that the underlying   RSU   or   PSU   vests. 
  Through 2015, the   Company  's Board authorized a total aggregate share repurchase plan of   $4 billion  . In February 2016, the   Board   authorized an additional   $1 billion   of share repurchases. The Company repurchased and retired   1.6 million   shares of common stock valued at approximately   $157 million   and   5.0 million   shares of common stock valued at approximately   $460 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company repurchased and retired   2.0 million   shares of common stock valued at approximately   $153 million   and   5.2 million   shares of common stock valued at approximately   $404 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. These amounts were recorded as a reduction of equity in the   unaudited Condensed Consolidated   Statement of Equity. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $1,191 million   remains available for share repurchases under the Board's authorization.

  LEGAL MATTERS 
  The   Company   is occasionally subject to litigation or other legal proceedings. The   Company   does not believe that the outcome of these, or any other, pending legal matters, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity of the   Company  . 
  Arbitration Ruling 
  In June 2012, a subsidiary of the Company made a request for arbitration as a result of a deadlock related to its Mexican joint ventures, IEBM and EMA. In March 2016, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "Court") completed the arbitration and agreed with the Company's subsidiary that a deadlock existed. Additionally, the Court awarded San Benedetto approximately   $4 million  , which the Company recorded during the first quarter of 2016 in SG A expenses. The Company paid the award during September 2016.  
   
  15  .   Segments    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015   and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the   Company  's operating structure consisted of the following   three   operating segments: 
             
    The Beverage Concentrates segment reflects sales of the   Company  's branded concentrates and syrup to third-party bottlers primarily in the   U.S.   and Canada. Most of the brands in this segment are carbonated soft drink brands. 
                
    The Packaged Beverages segment reflects sales in the   U.S.   and Canada from the manufacture and distribution of finished beverages and other products, including sales of the   Company  's own brands and third-party brands, through both the Direct Store Delivery system and the Warehouse Direct system. 
                
    The Latin America Beverages segment reflects sales in Mexico, the Caribbean, and other international markets from the manufacture and distribution of concentrates, syrup and finished beverages. 
     Segment results are based on management reports. Net sales and   SOP   are the significant financial measures used to assess the operating performance of the   Company  's operating segments. Intersegment sales are recorded at cost and are eliminated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Unallocated corporate costs  are excluded from the Company's measurement of segment performance and include stock-based compensation expense, unrealized commodity derivative gains and losses, and certain general corporate expenses.

ITEM 2.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    
  You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ("Annual Report"). 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "  Exchange Act  "), including, in particular, statements about future events, future financial performance, plans, strategies, expectations, prospects, competitive environment, regulation, labor matters and availability of raw materials. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "plan," "intend" or the negative of these terms or similar expressions in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Our actual financial performance could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections, and our financial performance may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We do not undertake any duty to update the forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains the names of some of our owned or licensed trademarks, trade names and service marks, which we refer to as our brands. All of the product names included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are either our registered trademarks or those of our licensors. 
   
  OVERVIEW 
  We are a leading integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor of non-alcoholic beverages in the United States ("  U.S.  "), Canada and Mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored (non-cola) carbonated soft drinks ("  CSD  s") and non-carbonated beverages ("  NCB  s"), including ready-to-drink teas, juices, juice drinks, water and mixers. Our brand portfolio includes popular     CSD     brands such as Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Pe afiel, Squirt, 7UP, Crush, A W, Sunkist soda and Schweppes, and NCB brands such as Snapple, Hawaiian Punch, Mott's, Clamato, Mr   Mrs T mixers and Rose's. Our largest brand, Dr Pepper, is a leading flavored     CSD     in the     U.S.     as reported by The Nielsen Company. We have some of the most recognized beverage brands in North America, with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers.    
  We operate as an integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor through our three segments. We believe our integrated business model strengthens our route-to-market and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our Direct Store Delivery ("  DSD  ") system and our Warehouse Direct ("  WD  ") delivery system. Our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage. 
  The beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. Our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays and religious festivals as well as weather fluctuations. 
  BEVERAGE CONCENTRATES 
  Our Beverage Concentrates segment is principally a brand ownership business. In this segment we manufacture and sell beverage concentrates in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the brands in this segment are   CSD   brands. Key brands include Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Crush, Schweppes, Sunkist soda, 7UP, A W, Sun Drop, RC Cola, Squirt, Diet Rite, Vernors and the concentrate form of Hawaiian Punch. 
  Almost all of our beverage concentrates are manufactured at our plant in St. Louis, Missouri. 
  Beverage concentrates are shipped to third-party bottlers, as well as to our own manufacturing systems, who combine them with carbonation, water, sweeteners and other ingredients, package the combined product in PET containers, glass bottles and aluminum cans, and sell them as finished beverages to retailers. Beverage concentrates are also manufactured into syrup, which is shipped to fountain customers, such as fast food restaurants, who mix the syrup with water and carbonation to create a finished beverage at the point of sale to consumers. Dr Pepper represents most of our fountain channel volume. Concentrate prices historically have been reviewed and adjusted at least on an annual basis. 
  
   39 

     Table of Contents     

Our Beverage Concentrates brands are sold by our bottlers, including our own Packaged Beverages segment, through all major retail channels including supermarkets, fountains, mass merchandisers, club stores, vending machines, convenience stores, gas stations, small groceries, drug chains and dollar stores.  
  PACKAGED BEVERAGES 
  Our Packaged Beverages segment is principally a brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business. In this segment, we primarily manufacture and distribute packaged beverages and other products, including our brands, third-party owned brands and certain private label beverages, in the U.S. and Canada.     Key   NCB   brands in this segment include Snapple, Hawaiian Punch, Mott's, Clamato, Yoo-Hoo, Deja Blue, ReaLemon, Mr and Mrs T mixers, Nantucket Nectars, Mistic, Garden Cocktail and Rose's. Key   CSD   brands in this segment include 7UP, Dr Pepper, A W, Canada Dry, Sunkist soda, Squirt, RC Cola, Vernors, Diet Rite and Sun Drop. Additionally, we distribute     third-party brands such as Big Red, FIJI mineral water, Bai brands, AriZona tea, Vita Coco coconut water, Body Armor, Neuro drinks, Core Hydration, Sparkling Fruit   2   O, Hydrive energy drinks and High-Brew. Although the majority of our Packaged Beverages' net sales relate to our brands, we also provide a route-to-market for these third party brand owners seeking effective distribution for their new and emerging brands. These brands give us exposure in certain markets to fast growing segments of the beverage industry with minimal capital investment. A portion of our sales also comes from bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others, which is also referred to as contract manufacturing.    
  Our Packaged Beverages' products     are manufactured in multiple facilities across the   U.S.   and are sold or distributed to retailers and their warehouses by our own distribution network or by third-party distributors. The raw materials used to manufacture our products include aluminum cans and ends, glass bottles, PET bottles and caps, paper products, sweeteners, juices, water and other ingredients. 
  We sell our Packaged Beverages' products both through our     DSD     system and     our   WD     system,     both of which include the sales to all major retail channels, including supermarkets, fountains, mass merchandisers, club stores, vending machines, convenience stores, gas stations, small groceries, drug chains and dollar stores. 
  LATIN AMERICA BEVERAGES 
  Our Latin America Beverages segment is a brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business. This segment participates mainly in the carbonated mineral water, flavored   CSD  , bottled water and vegetable juice categories, with particular strength in carbonated mineral water, vegetable juice categories and grapefruit flavored   CSD  s. Key brands include Pe afiel, Squirt, Aguafiel, Clamato and Crush. 
  In Mexico, we manufacture and distribute our products through our bottling operations and third party bottlers and distributors.   We sell our finished beverages through all major Mexican retail channels, including the "mom and pop" stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and on-premise channels.     In the Caribbean, we distribute our products through third-party bottlers and distributors.   We have also begun to distribute certain products in other international jurisdictions through various third-party bottlers and distributors.

VOLUME 
  In evaluating our performance, we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages. 
  Beverage Concentrates Sales Volume 
  In our Beverage Concentrates segment, we measure our sales volume in two ways: (1) "concentrate case sales" and (2) "bottler case sales." The unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage, the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings. 
  Concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors. A concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage. It does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate. Our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases. 
  Although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales, we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels. 
  Packaged Beverages Sales Volume 
  In our Packaged Beverages segment, we measure volume as case sales to customers. A case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us. Case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to and/or distributed by us. 
  Volume in Bottler Case Sales 
  In addition to sales volume, we measure volume in bottler case sales ("  volume (BCS)  ") as sales of packaged beverages, in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases, sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors. Our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of   volume (BCS)  . 
  Bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels, which can be affected by seasonality, bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - FINANCIAL OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

During the third quarter of 2016, we recognized an income tax benefit of $17 million driven primarily by a restructuring of the ownership of our Canadian business that occurred during the third quarter of 2016.  The income tax benefit added $0.09 to diluted earnings per share. 
                
    During the third quarter of 2016, we recognized a non-taxable gain of $5 million associated with the step-acquisition of Industria Embotelladora de Bebidas Mexicanas, S.A. de C.V. ("IEBM") and Embotelladora Mexicana de Agua, S.A. de C.V. ("EMA") within our Latin America Beverages segment, which added $0.03 to diluted earnings per share.

  Consolidated Operations 
  The following table sets forth our   unaudited consolidated   results of operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Volume (BCS)  .     Volume (BCS)   increased   2%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  . In the U.S. and Canada, volume increased   1%  , and in Mexico and the Caribbean, volume increased   4%  , compared with the year ago period. Branded   CSD   increased   2%  , while   NCB   volume was flat.  
  In branded   CSD  s, Dr Pepper increased   1%   driven by increases in regular, primarily driven by our fountain business, and diet which were partially offset by declines in TEN. Canada Dry, 7UP, A W and Sunkist soda (our "Core 4 brands") increased   2%   as a   7%   gain in Canada Dry and a   1%   increase in Sunkist soda were partially offset by a   2%   reduction in A W and a   1%   decrease in 7UP. Squirt increased   7%   due to higher sales to our third-party bottlers and product innovation in our Latin America Beverages segment and our Hispanic strategy in the U.S. Schweppes grew   9%   due to continued growth in ginger ale and sparkling water categories. Crush was   4%   higher in the current period reflecting increased promotional activity in a large retailer. Pe afiel grew   1%   in our Latin America Beverages segment due to distribution gains, increased promotional activity and product innovation, partially offset by competitive headwinds. These increases were partially offset by our other   CSD   brands in total, which decreased   3%  .  
  In branded   NCB  s, our water category increased   16%   driven by distribution gains for Bai brands and Fiji, incremental promotional activity behind Bai brands in our club channel and category growth within Mexico for Aguafiel. Clamato grew   5%   driven primarily by higher promotional activity, distribution gains and product innovation in Mexico. These increases were fully offset by a   6%   decline in Hawaiian Punch as a result of reduced promotional activity and higher pricing for our single-serve packages, while Mott's decreased   6%   as volume losses due to declines in the juice category were partially offset by volume gains in our sauce products. Compared to the prior period, our other NCB brands declined   9%   as a result of discontinuing the distribution of Country Time. Snapple was flat compared with the year ago period. 
  Net Sales.     Net sales increased   $50 million  , or approximately   3%  , for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  . The primary factors of the increase in net sales included: 
             
    Favorable product, package and segment mix, which increased net sales by   2%  ; 
                
    Increase in shipments, which increased net sales by   1%  ;

Gross Profit.     Gross profit increased   $40 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  . Gross margin of   59.3%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , was higher than the   58.7%   gross margin for the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  . The primary drivers of the change in gross margin for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   included: 
             
    Favorable comparison in our mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts, which increased our gross margin by   0.7%  ; 
                
    Higher net pricing, which raised our gross margin by   0.5%  ; 
                
    Lower commodity costs, led by packaging, and net of the change in our   LIFO   inventory provision, which raised our gross margin by   0.3%  ; 
                
    Ongoing productivity improvements, which increased our gross margin by   0.3%  ; 
                
    Unfavorable product, package and segment mix, which reduced our gross margin by   0.8%  ;  
                
    Other manufacturing costs, which lowered our gross margin by   0.3%  ; and  
                
    Unfavorable foreign currency effects, which decreased our gross margin by   0.2%  . 
       
  The favorable mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $5 million   in unrealized gains versus   $7 million   in unrealized losses in the year ago period. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses increased   $11 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   three months ended     September 30,     2015  . The drivers of the increase in SG A expenses were increases in our planned marketing investments and higher people costs. These increases were partially offset by   $7 million   of favorable foreign currency effects and lower logistics costs, primarily driven by lower fuel rates. 
  Income from Operations.     Income from operations   in  creased   $36 million   to   $373 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   due to the increase in gross profit and a $5 million gain on the step-acquisition of IEBM and EMA, partially offset by the increase in SG A expenses. Refer to   Note 2 of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information relating to the gain on the step-acquisition of IEBM and EMA.  
  Interest Expense.     Interest expense increased   $5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   three months ended     September 30,     2015   due primarily to the higher average debt balance and higher average interest rates attributable to the issuance of our senior unsecured notes due in 2025 and 2045, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015.  
  Effective Tax Rate.     The effective tax rates for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   29.7%   and   34.4%  , respectively.

The higher discounts was driven by our fountain business partially offset by a favorable comparison of the annual true-up of our estimated customer incentive liability.  
  SOP.   SOP   in  creased   $13 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  , primarily driven by an increase in net sales partially offset by higher   SG A   expenses. The increase in   SG A   expenses was the result of a   $5 million   increase in planned marketing investments, higher people costs and increases in other operating costs. 
  Volume (BCS)  .     Volume (BCS)   had a   2%   increase for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  . Dr Pepper increased   1%   compared to the year ago period driven by increases in our fountain business partially offset by declines in our diet. Schweppes and Crush had gains of   9%   and   4%  , respectively, reflecting increased promotional activity at a large retailer. Our Core 4 brands were   1%   higher compared to the year ago period as a result of a   5%   gain in Canada Dry, partially offset by a   8%   reduction in 7UP, a   2%   decrease in Sunkist soda and a   1%   decline in A W. These increases were partially offset by a   7%   decline in our other brands in total as a result of discontinuing the distribution of Country Time.

  The following table details our Packaged Beverages segment's net sales and SOP for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

Volume.   Branded CSD volumes   de  creased   2%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  . Volume for our Core 4 brands decreased   2%   compared to the prior period, led by a   6%   decrease in 7UP, a   3%   decrease in A W and a   2%   decline in Sunkist soda, partially offset by a   6%   increase in Canada Dry. Dr Pepper decreased   1%   due to declines in TEN and diet. Compared to the prior period, our other CSD brands decreased   6%  . These decreases were partially offset by a   6%   gain in Squirt. 
  Branded   NCB   volumes   in  creased   2%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  . Our water category gained   23%   due primarily to distribution gains for Bai brands and Fiji, and incremental promotional activity behind Bai brands in our club channel. Snapple gained   2%   due to the increase in our Snapple Premium products, while Clamato increased   4%   as a result of distribution gains. Our other NCB brands were   4%   higher compared to the prior period, led by Body Armor and Venom. These increases were partially offset by a   6%   decline in Hawaiian Punch primarily due to higher pricing for our single-serve packages and a   4%   decrease in Mott's due to declines in the juice category, partially offset by gains in our sauce products. 
  Contract manufacturing decreased   4%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  .

Net Sales.     Net sales increased   $124 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  . Net sales increased due to favorable product and package mix, as a result of our NCBs, including our allied brands, and higher pricing. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in our contract manufacturing. 
  SOP.   SOP increased   $67 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015   as increases in net sales were partially offset by increases in cost of sales and SG A expenses. Cost of sales increased as a result of higher costs associated with product mix, as a result of our NCBs, including our allied brands, which were partially offset by lower commodity costs, led by packaging, and ongoing productivity improvements. SG A expenses increased as a result of higher people costs and a non-recurring charge of $4 million related to the transition of a certain employee benefit program, which were partially offset by reductions in our logistics costs, driven primarily by lower fuel rates. 
   
  LATIN AMERICA BEVERAGES 
  The following table details our Latin America Beverages segment's net sales and SOP for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

Volume.     Sales volume   in  creased   5%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared with the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  . The   in  crease in sales volume was driven by a   6%   gain in Squirt primarily due to higher sales to third party bottlers and product innovation and a   3%   increase in Pe afiel as a result of increased promotional activity and distribution gains, partially offset by competitive headwinds. Aguafiel grew   12%   as a result of category growth. Clamato was   19%   higher compared to the prior period due to increased promotional activity and distribution gains. Crush and our other brands grew by   9%   and   2%  , respectively. These increases were partially offset by a   14%   decrease in 7UP driven by declines in Puerto Rico. 
  Net Sales.     Net sales   de  creased   $27 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  . Net sales   de  creased as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation of   $55 million  , partially offset by increased sales volume and higher pricing. 
  SOP.     SOP   de  creased   $8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  , driven by a decrease in net sales partially offset by decreases in cost of sales and SG A expenses. Cost of sales declined compared to the prior period as a result of favorable foreign currency effects, lower commodity costs, led by packaging, and ongoing productivity improvements. These decreases were partially offset by higher costs associated with increased sales volumes.   SG A   expenses decreased compared to the prior period as a result of favorable foreign currency effects, which were partially offset by a   $4 million   arbitration award related to our Mexican joint venture, higher people costs, increased professional fees, higher logistic costs and increases in other operating costs. The impact of the favorable foreign currency effects, which decreased cost of sales and   SG A   expenses, totaled   $37 million  . 
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  The process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with   U.S. GAAP   requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments. These estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary.  
  
   51 

     Table of Contents     

We have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates: 
             
    goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets; 
                
    revenue recognition; 
                
    pension benefits; 
                
    risk management programs; and 
                
    income taxes. 
     These critical accounting estimates are discussed in greater detail in our Annual Report. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity 
  Customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by various risk factors discussed under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, including recession or other economic downturn in the   U.S.  ,   Mexico and the Caribbean or Canada  , which could result in a reduction in our sales volume. Similarly, disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. These disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials. 
  We believe that the following events, trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity: 
              
    our continued repurchases of our outstanding common stock pursuant to our repurchase programs; 
                
    continued payment of dividends; 
                
    continued capital expenditures; 
                
    seasonality of our operating cash flows; 
                
    our ability to issue unsecured commercial paper notes ("  Commercial Paper  ") on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of   $500 million  ; 
                
    fluctuations in our tax obligations; and 
                
    future equity investments in allied brands and/or acquisitions of regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage. 
      
  Financing Arrangements 
  The following descriptions represent our available financing arrangements as of     September 30, 2016  . As of     September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenant requirements fo  r our senior unsecured notes,   unsecured credit agreement and     commercial paper program  .    
  Commercial Paper Program 
  On December 10, 2010, we entered into a commercial paper program under which we may issue   Commercial Paper   on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of   $500 million  . The maturities of the   Commercial Paper   will vary, but may not exceed 364 days from the date of issuance. We issue   Commercial Paper   as needed for general corporate purposes. The program is supported by the   Revolver   (as defined below). Outstanding   Commercial Paper   reduces the amount of borrowing capacity available under the   Revolver   and outstanding amounts under the   Revolver   reduce the   Commercial Paper   availability. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had   no     Commercial Paper   outstanding, and there were   no   commercial paper borrowings during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had weighted average commercial paper borrowings of   $1 million   and   $30 million  , respectively. These borrowings had maturities of 90 days or less and a weighted average annual rate of   0.65%   and   0.51%  , respectively.

     Table of Contents     

Unsecured Credit Agreement    
  On September 25, 2012, we entered into a five-year unsecured credit agreement (the "  Credit Agreement  "), which provides for a   $500 million   revolving line of credit (the "  Revolver  "). Borrowings under the   Revolver   bear interest at a floating rate per annum based upon the alternate base rate ("  ABR  ") or the Eurodollar rate, in each case plus an applicable margin which varies based upon our debt ratings. Rates range from   0.000%   to   0.300%   for   ABR   loans and from   0.795%   to   1.300%   for Eurodollar loans. The   ABR   is defined as the greater of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank's prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.500%   and (c) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ("  LIBOR  ") for a one month interest period. The adjusted   LIBOR   is   LIBOR   for dollars adjusted for a statutory reserve rate set by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System. 
  Additionally, the   Revolver   is available for the issuance of letters of credit and swingline advances not to exceed   $75 million   and   $50 million  , respectively. Swingline advances will accrue interest at a rate equal to the   ABR   plus the applicable margin. Letters of credit and swingline advances will reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, the amount available under the   Revolver  .  
  Refer to   Note 5 of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for discussion of amounts utilized and available under the Revolver. 
  The   Credit Agreement   further provides that we may request at any time, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, that the aggregate commitments under the facility be increased by a total amount not to exceed   $250 million  . 
  The   Credit Agreement  's representations, warranties, covenants and events of default are generally customary for investment grade credit and include a covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt (as defined in the   Credit Agreement  ) to annualized consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the   Credit Agreement  ) of no more than 3.00 to 1.00, tested quarterly. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, among other things, amounts outstanding under the   Credit Agreement   may be accelerated and the commitments may be terminated. Our obligations under the   Credit Agreement   are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries on the terms set forth in the   Credit Agreement  . The   Credit Agreement   has a maturity date of September 25, 2017; however, with the consent of lenders holding more than 50% of the total commitments under the   Credit Agreement   and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we may extend the maturity date for up to two additional one-year terms. 
  A     facility fee is payable quarterly to the lenders on the unused portion of the commitments available under the     Revolver     equal to     0.08%     to     0.20%     per annum, depending upon our credit ratings.    
  Letters of Credit Facilities 
  We currently have letters of credit facilities available in addition to the portion of the   Revolver   reserved for issuance of letters of credit. Under these incremental letters of credit facilities,   $120 million   is available for the issuance of letters of credit,   $60 million   of which was utilized as of   September 30, 2016   and   $60 million   of which remains available for use. 
  Shelf Registration Statement 
  On   August 10, 2016  , our Board authorized us to issue up to   $2,000 million   of securities from time to time. Subsequently, we filed a "well-known seasoned issuer" shelf registration statement with the SEC, effective   September 2, 2016  , which registers an indeterminate amount of securities for future sales. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had issued   $400 million   of 2026 Notes under this shelf registration statement and $1,600 million of securities remained authorized to be issued. 
   
  Debt Ratings 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our credit ratings were as follows: 

These debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements. A downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations.

Table of Contents     

Cash Management 
  We primarily fund our liquidity needs from cash flow from operations and cash on hand. We will use amounts available to us as discussed in "  Financing Arrangements  ", as seasonality of our operating cash flows impact short-term liquidity, our senior unsecured notes mature, or as other events may occur as described in "  Acquisitions and Investments  ". 
   
  Capital Expenditures 
  Capital expenditures were   $110 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Capital expenditures were primarily related to machinery and equipment, our fleet, and costs associated with a new manufacturing plant in Mexico. In   2016  , we expect to incur annual capital expenditures, net of proceeds from disposals, in an amount approximately 3% of our net sales, which we expect to fund through cash provided by operating activities. 
   
  Acquisitions and Investments 
  We may make future equity investments in allied brands and/or acquisitions of regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage. Any acquisitions may require additional funding for future capital expenditures and possibly restructuring expenses. 
   
  Liquidity 
  Based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months. To the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary. 
  The following table summarizes our cash activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES 
  Net cash provided by operating activities   de  creased   $40 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to our $35 million multi-employer pension plan settlement payment. 
   
  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES 
  Cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   consisted primarily of purchases of property, plant and equipment of   $110 million  , the step acquisition of IEBM and EMA of   $15 million   and an additional investment in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC of   $6 million  , partially offset by cash received in the step acquisition of IEBM and EMA of   $17 million  . Cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   consisted primarily of purchases of property, plant and equipment of   $71 million  , the equity method investment in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC of   $20 million  , and the purchase of a cost method investment in BAI Brands, LLC for   $15 million  .  
   
  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
  Cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   consisted primarily of the repayment of the aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes of   $500 million  , stock repurchases of   $460 million   and dividend payments of   $288 million  , partially offset by the issuance of   $400 million   aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   consisted primarily of stock repurchases of   $404 million   and dividend payments of   $264 million  .

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents   de  creased   $291 million   since   December 31, 2015   to   $620 million   as of   September 30, 2016   primarily driven by repayment of senior unsecured notes, returns to our stockholders, and capital expenditures, partially offset by operating cash flows and the issuance of our 2026 Notes. 
  Our cash balances are used to fund working capital requirements, scheduled debt and interest payments, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. Cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the   U.S.   periodically as working capital funding requirements in those jurisdictions allow. Foreign cash balances were   $86 million   and   $52 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We accrue tax costs for repatriation, as applicable, as cash is generated in those foreign jurisdictions.  
   
                 Total Shareholder Distributions 
  Our Board  declared dividends aggregating $1.59 and $1.44 per share on outstanding common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and we continued common stock repurchases based upon authorizations from our Board. Refer to Part II, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding these repurchases. 
  The following chart details these payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Contractual Commitments and Obligations 
  We enter into various contractual obligations that impact, or could impact, our liquidity. Based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations. To the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary.  
  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies, as of   September 30, 2016  , that have significantly changed from the amounts disclosed in our Annual Report:  
   
 ____________________________ 
           (1) 
    Amounts represent payment for the senior unsecured notes issued by us. Please refer to   Note 5 of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for further information. 
              (2) 
    Amounts represent payments under agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including capital obligations and long-term contractual obligations. 
              (3) 
    In October 2016, the   Company   redeemed a portion of the   2018 Notes   and retired, at a premium, an aggregate principal amount of approximately   $360 million  . The loss on early extinguishment of the   2018 Notes   was approximately   $31 million   due primarily to a make-whole provision in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. Please refer to   Note 17 of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
              (4) 
    As of December 31, 2015, this amount represented our contractual payment obligations, which included the associated interest, for our multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities. During the first quarter of 2016, we negotiated a $35 million lump-sum settlement to extinguish these contractual liabilities, which was paid during the second quarter of 2016.   
     Through   September 30, 2016  , there have been no other material changes to the amounts disclosed in our Annual Report. 
   
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

ITEM 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge or mitigate commercial risks. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculation, investing or trading. 
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
  The majority of our net sales, expenses and capital purchases are transacted in   U.S.   dollars. However, we have exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso against the   U.S.   dollar. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred. As of   September 30, 2016  , the impact to our income from operations of a 10% change (up or down) in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately   $22 million   on an annual basis. 
  We use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of   $18 million   maturing at various dates through   April 13, 2017  . 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We centrally manage our debt portfolio through the use of interest rate swaps and monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable rate debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of our fixed-rate debt, excluding capital lease obligations, was   $3,178 million  ,   $720 million   of which is designated in fair value hedging relationships and exposed to variability in interest rates. 
  The following table is an estimate of the impact to the fair value hedges that could result from hypothetical interest rate changes during the term of the financial instruments, based on debt levels as of   September 30, 2016  :

    $7 million increase 
      
    $49 million decrease 
   
 ____________________________ 
           (1) 
    We pay an average floating rate, which fluctuates periodically, based on   LIBOR   and a credit spread, as a result of designated fair value hedges on certain debt instruments. See   Note 6 of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for further information. As we would not expect LIBOR to fall below zero, we calculated the hypothetical change in the interest rate to zero. 
     (2)  The change in fair value would impact the carrying value of our unsecured senior notes with an offset to our derivative instrument positions. See   Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for quantification of those positions.  
  Commodity Risks 
  We are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. Our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of PET, aluminum, diesel fuel, corn (for high fructose corn syrup), apple juice concentrate, apples, sucrose and natural gas (for use in processing and packaging). 
  We utilize commodities forward and future contracts and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities. The fair market value of these contracts as of   September 30, 2016   was a net   asset   of   $9 million  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the impact of a 10% change (up or down) in market prices for these commodities where the risk of adverse movements has not been hedged is estimated to have   no   impact to our income from operations for the remainder of   2016  .

    Due to the completion of the IRS audit for our 2006-2008 federal income tax returns in August 2013, we recognized $430 million of other expense, net, as we no longer anticipate collecting amounts from Mondel z. Additionally, in June 2013, a bill was enacted by the Canadian government, which reduced amounts amortized for income tax purposes. As a result, we recognized $38 million of indemnity income due to the reduction of our long-term liability to Mondel z.
