Trxade Group, Inc.  
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
   
  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
   
 Trxade Group, Inc. ( Company ) owns 100% of Trxade, Inc., ShopRX, Ltd., and Westminster Pharmaceutical LLC. The merger of Trxade, Inc. and Trxade Group, Inc. occurred in July 2013. Westminster Pharmaceutical LLC was formed in January 2013.  
   
 Trxade, Inc. is a web based market platform that enables trade among healthcare buyers and sellers of pharmaceuticals, accessories and services.  
   
 Westminster Pharmaceutical LLC, provides US state licensed pharmacies and other buying groups with FDA approved pharmaceuticals as well as access to current benchmark pricing of pharmaceuticals. 
   
 ShopRX, Ltd. is the Company s newly launched UK based subsidiary.  The Company hopes to establish a similar business to Trxade, Inc. in the United Kingdom in the future under this entity. 
   
 The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Trxade Group, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Form 10K Registration Statement.  
   
 In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 as reported in the Company s Registration Statement on Form 10K have been omitted.  
   
 Income (loss) Per Share   Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to commons stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed similar to basic net loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilute. At September 30 2016 diluted net loss per share is equivalent to basic net loss per share as the inclusion of any shares committed to be issued would be anti-dilutive.  
   
 The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted Loss per Share:

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  
   
 These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising additional capital and generating future profitable operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the necessary funds when needed to finance its ongoing costs. 
   
 The Company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including cash flow from operations, costs to complete platform improvements, if warranted, and competition and market conditions. The Company s recurring operating losses and working capital needs will require that it obtain additional capital to operate its business. Given the Company s limited operating history, lack of revenues, and its operating losses, there can be no assurance that it will be able to achieve and maintain profitability. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE 3   Property and Equipment  
   
 In July 2016, the purchase of ERP software was completed. The cost of the acquisition was $78,000 and the total balance was outstanding at September 30, 2016. The depreciation for the current year is $6,500.  
   
  NOTE 4   SHORT-TERM DEBT   
   
  Convertible Promissory Note  
   
 Convertible promissory notes were issued in the aggregate amount of $200,000 in April and May 2015. The term of the notes was one year. Simple interest of 10% was payable at the maturity date of the note. Prior to maturity the notes may be converted for common stock at a conversion price of $1.50. The holders of the notes were granted warrants at one share of common stock for every $4.00 of the note principal amount, which totaled a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock.  These warrants were issued at a strike price of $1.50 and an expiration date of five years from date of issuance. 
   
 In April and May 2016, $50,000 of the $200,000 in convertible promissory notes (plus $5,000 in interest) was repaid. A one-year extension was executed on the remaining notes and the interest owed, totaling $15,000 became part of the adjusted principal of notes and the balance of $165,000 is due May 2017.  In connection with the one-year extension of the maturity date of the outstanding notes, the holders of the notes were granted warrants at one common stock for $4.00 of the note amount, and warrants to purchase 41,250 shares of common stock were issued at a strike price of $1.50 and an expiration date of five years from date of issuance. The amendment of the note was considered a debt extinguishment and a loss on extinguishment of debt was booked in the amount of $37,579 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   
 In August 2016, $40,000 in promissory notes were issued. The term of the note was one year. Simple interest of 10% is payable at the maturity date of the note. Prior to maturity the note may be converted for common stock at a conversion price of $1.50.  
   
 In September 2016, convertible promissory notes were issued in the aggregate amount of $150,000. The term of the notes was one year.

The holders of the notes were granted warrants at one share of common stock for every $4.00 of the note principal amount, which totaled a warrant to purchase 37,500 shares of common stock.  These warrants were issued at a strike price of $.62 and an expiration date of five years from date of issuance. 
   
 The Company evaluated the embedded conversion feature within the above convertible notes under ASC 815-15 and ASC 815-40 and determined that the embedded conversion feature does not meet the definition of a derivative liability. Then the Company evaluated the conversion feature for a beneficial conversion feature at inception. The Company accounted for the intrinsic value of a Beneficial Conversion Feature inherent to the convertible note payable and a total debt discount of $53,546 was recorded in 2015 and $0 as of the date of the debt modification.   
   
 The Company also uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to estimate the fair value of the warrants issued along with convertible notes on the date of grant. The Company accounted for the relative fair value of the warrants issued and a total debt discount $53,546 and $71,699 was recorded in 2015 and 2016 respectively.

  Convertible Promissory Note  
   
 Secured convertible promissory notes were issued in the aggregate amount of $950,000 in November and December 2015. The original term of the notes was three years. In June 2016, the note was extended to a four-year maturity for consideration of a senior secured position on the assets of the Company.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
  Forward-Looking Statements   
   
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Report ), including the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future results of the Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the management of the Company. Words such as  expects,   anticipates,   targets,   goals,   projects,   intends,   plans,   believes,   seeks,   estimates,  variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this Report, and in other reports the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), including the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.  
   
  The following discussion is based upon our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of stock-based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.   
   
  Company Overview  
   
 We have designed, developed, and now own and operate business-to-business web based marketplace focused on the US pharmaceutical industry. Our core service brings the nation s independent pharmacies and accredited national suppliers of pharmaceuticals together to provide efficient and transparent buying and selling opportunities. 
   
 We began operations under our predecessor in August of 2010 and spent over two years creating and enhancing our web-based services. Our services provide enhanced pricing transparency, purchasing capabilities and other value added services on a single platform to focus on serving the nation s approximately 24,000 independent pharmacies with an annual purchasing power of $96 billion. Our national supplier partners are able to fulfill orders on our platform immediately and provide the pharmacy with cost saving payment terms and next day delivery capabilities in unrestrictive states under the Model State Pharmacy Act and Model Rules of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (Model Act).  Important additions to this platform further include the generation of pharmacy to pharmacy trading capabilities to help independents with their overstocked inventories in a more organized manner. We expanded rapidly in 2013 and broke the 1,000 member pharmacy mark that year. 
   
 In April 2013 Westminster Pharmaceuticals, LLC was formed to take advantage of certain supply disruptions for specialty and other niche pharmaceuticals. These pharmaceuticals were sold to independent pharmacies. In July 2016 the Company transitioned from this revenue model to focus on private label distribution. 
   
 In September 2016 the creation of ShopRx, Ltd, a UK corporation was completed. ShopRx will implement the market platform developed by Trxade, Inc. which enables trade among healthcare buyers and sellers of pharmaceuticals and accessories. The market platform will operate in UK and other EU zones.

 Includes wages and payroll, legal and accounting, marketing, rent and web development. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $94,551 and other current assets of $1,254,897.  Additional funds will be needed to continue to expand our platform and customer base, and cover general and administrative expense. 
   
 Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily through equity capital raises, convertible debt, loans and operational revenue.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising additional capital and generating future profitable operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the necessary funds when needed to finance its ongoing costs.  The Company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including cash flow from operations, costs to complete platform improvements, if warranted, and competition and market conditions. The Company s recurring operating losses and working capital needs will require that it obtain additional capital to operate its business. Given the Company s limited operating history, lack of revenues, and its operating losses, there can be no assurance that it will be able to achieve and maintain profitability. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.   
   
 We will need significantly more cash to implement our plan to operate a business-to-business web based marketplace focused on the US pharmaceutical industry. If we obtain additional financing by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders  ownership will be diluted. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. We may be unable to maintain operations at a level sufficient for investors to obtain a return on their investments in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable.

Cash Flows  
   
 The following table summarizes our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,557,073. This is an increase of $771,093 from same period in 2015 and was due to increased staffing as the Company discontinued its wholesale business and transitioned into private label distribution.

  Working Capital  
   
 Our negative working capital as of September 30, 2016 and working capital December 31, 2015 is summarized as follows: 

Current Assets  
   
 The decrease in our current assets was primarily due to cash decrease of $765,581.  This decease of cash resulted from increased costs related to staffing increases as the Company discontinued its wholesale business and transitioned into private label distribution. Furthermore, the Company had significant costs associated with IT development of the Company s web platform and its new ERP system, professional fees and inventory purchases, and the launch of its new UK based subsidiary, ShopRX, Ltd. 
   
  Current Liabilities  
   
 Current liabilities increase is primarily due to an increase in accounts payable by $220,635 and accrued liabilities of $348,909.

Results of Operations   
   
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $4,339,419 compared to $3,501,203 for the comparable period in 2015.  This increase was attributable to fee income from our web-based platform and pharmaceutical sales. Our sales department has continued to add customers in 2016 through direct marketing and customer training.  
   
 Cost of sales increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $2,286,643 compared to $1,313,104 for the comparable period in 2015.  This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from the pharmaceutical sales which has higher cost of sales than our other revenue sources.  
   
 General and administrative expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $4,008,890 compared to $2,507,324 for the comparable period in 2015.  A large component of general and administrative expenses was in 2016 was affected by an increase in employee cash compensation expenses in the 2016 period due to increased staffing as the Company discontinued its wholesale business and transitioned into private label distribution, as well as additional significant costs associated with IT development of the Company s web platform and its new ERP system.   
   
 Warrant and options expense in the 2016 and 2015 periods represents compensation cost related to the issuance of employee stock options. 
   
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,637,875 to $803,278.  This decrease was attributable to transitioning from wholesale revenue to a focus and increased expense in developing the Company s private label distribution in pharmaceutical sales. 

14 

Cost of sales decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $230,672 compared to $700,637.  This decrease was primarily attributable discounting the Company s wholesale product division, which led to a decrease in revenue from the wholesale pharmaceutical sales and which has higher cost of sales than our other revenue sources. General and administrative expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $1,321,723 compared to $957,140 for the comparable period in 2015.  Implementation of ERP software resulted in additional consulting expense of about $100,000 for the quarter. A large component of general and administrative expenses was an increase in employee cash compensation expense in the 2016 period due to increased staffing in private label distribution, the development of ShopRX platform and the ongoing operation of the ERP software.  
   
 Warrant and options expense in the 2016 and 2015 periods represents compensation cost related to the issuance of employee stock options. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
   
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period. The following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies, defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
   
   Revenue Recognition    
   
 In general the Company accounts for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition . 
   
 Trxade, Inc. generates net fee income as a percentage of the total transactions between the buyer (independent pharmacies) and the seller (wholesaler) of pharmaceutical drugs on the Trxade web-based platform.  Revenue is recognized when four steps are met: (1) the price is fixed and determined as the buyer orders the drugs from the wholesaler; (2) The wholesaler has signed a contract with Trxade, Inc. which recognizes that an arrangement exists; (3) The wholesaler delivers the drugs purchased to the buyer, products are delivered; and (4) The collectability is reasonably assured by the wholesaler through prior credit checks and payment experience.     
   
 Westminster Pharmaceutical LLC generates gross revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical drugs to independent pharmacies or wholesalers. Revenue is recognized when four steps are met: (1) the price is fixed and determinable at the time of the transaction with an invoice; (2) The invoice is also persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (3) The products are delivered to the buyer; and (4) The collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured by credit check prior to the transaction and experience with the customer.   
   
   Stock-Based Compensation   
   
 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provision of ASC 505,  Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees  ( ASC 505 ), Share Based Payments to Non-Employees, and ASC 505 which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying instruments vest. 
   
 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation . ASC 718 requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period.
