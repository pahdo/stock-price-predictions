1. 
    Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
       
  Organization 
  TRI Pointe Group is engaged in the design, construction and sale of innovative single-family attached and detached homes through its portfolio of six quality brands across eight states, including Maracay Homes in Arizona, Pardee Homes in California and Nevada, Quadrant Homes in Washington, Trendmaker Homes in Texas, TRI Pointe Homes in California and Colorado and Winchester Homes in Maryland and Virginia. 
  Formation of TRI Pointe Group 
  On July 7, 2015, TRI Pointe Homes reorganized its corporate structure (the  Reorganization ) whereby TRI Pointe Homes became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe Group.  As a result of the Reorganization, each share of common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of TRI Pointe Homes ( Homes Common Stock ) was cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive   one   validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, of TRI Pointe Group ( Group Common Stock ), each share having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof as the shares of Homes Common Stock being so converted.  TRI Pointe Group, as the successor issuer to TRI Pointe Homes (pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act), began making filings under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act on July 7, 2015. 
  In connection with the Reorganization, TRI Pointe Group (i) became a co-issuer of TRI Pointe Homes    4.375%   Senior Notes due   2019   (the  2019 Notes ) and TRI Pointe Homes    5.875%   Senior Notes due   2024   (the  2024 Notes  and (ii) replaced TRI Pointe Homes as the borrower under TRI Pointe Homes  existing unsecured revolving credit facility. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, as contained within the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ). 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, as well as other entities in which the Company has a controlling interest and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) in which the Company is the primary beneficiary.  The noncontrolling interests as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   represent the outside owners  interests in the Company s consolidated entities and the net equity of the VIE owners.  All significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation with respect to interim financial statements, have been included. 
  Use of Estimates 
  Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from our estimates. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain amounts in our consolidated financial statements for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the Company's change in reportable segments to include the addition of our financial services operation in the fourth quarter of 2015.  These reclassifications had no material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: identify the contract(s) with a customer; identify the performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue-recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , most industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the accounting standards codification, and some cost guidance related to construction-type and production-type contracts. On July 9, 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year and it is now effective for public entities for the annual periods ending after December 15, 2017, and for annual and interim periods thereafter.  Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU 2014-09.  Early adoption is permitted, but can be no earlier than the original public entity effective date of fiscal years, and the interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the approach for implementation and the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ),   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , which requires management to evaluate, in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable) and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, ( ASU 2015-02 ),   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.     ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016 and the adoption had no impact on our current or prior year financial statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, ( ASU 2015-17 ),   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of position.  ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, ( ASU 2016-02 ),   Leases     (Topic 842): Leases  , which requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leased assets and provide additional disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and, at that time, we will adopt the new standard using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 may have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, ( ASU 2016-09 ),   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 may have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  
   -   8   - 

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, ( ASU 2016-15 ),   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  :   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   which provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2016-15 may have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

3. 
    Segment Information 
     We operate   two   principal businesses: homebuilding and financial services. 
  Our homebuilding operations consist of   six   homebuilding brands that acquire and develop land and construct and sell single-family detached and attached homes. In accordance with ASC Topic 280,   Segment Reporting  , in determining the most appropriate reportable segments, we considered similar economic and other characteristics, including product types, average selling prices, gross profits, production processes, suppliers, subcontractors, regulatory environments, land acquisition results, and underlying demand and supply. Based upon the above factors, our homebuilding operations are comprised of the following   six   reportable segments: Maracay Homes, consisting of operations in Arizona; Pardee Homes, consisting of operations in California and Nevada; Quadrant Homes, consisting of operations in Washington; Trendmaker Homes, consisting of operations  
  
   -   9   - 

in Texas; TRI Pointe Homes, consisting of operations in California and Colorado; and Winchester Homes, consisting of operations in Maryland and Virginia. 
  Our financial services operation ( TRI Pointe Solutions ) is a reportable segment and is comprised of mortgage financing operations ( TRI Pointe Connect ) and title services operations ( TRI Pointe Assurance ).  While our homebuyers may obtain financing from any mortgage provider of their choice, TRI Pointe Connect, which was formed as a joint venture with an established mortgage lender, can act as a preferred mortgage broker to our homebuyers in all of the markets in which we operate, providing mortgage originations that help facilitate the sale and closing process as well as generate additional fee income for us.  TRI Pointe Assurance provides title examinations for our homebuyers in our Trendmaker Homes and Winchester Homes brands.  TRI Pointe Assurance is a wholly owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe and acts as a title agency for First American Title Insurance Company.  We commenced our financial services operation in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
  The term  Corporate  refers to a non-operating segment that develops and implements company-wide strategic initiatives and provides support to our homebuilding reporting segments by centralizing certain administrative functions, such as marketing, legal, accounting, treasury, insurance, internal audit and risk management, information technology and human resources, to benefit from economies of scale. Our Corporate non-operating segment also includes general and administrative expenses related to operating our corporate headquarters. A portion of the expenses incurred by Corporate is allocated to the homebuilding reporting segments. 
  The reportable segments follow the same accounting policies as our consolidated financial statements described in Note 1,   Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  . Operational results of each reportable segment are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the reportable segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. 
    
  Total revenues and income before income taxes for each of our reportable segments were as follows (in thousands): 

-   10   - 

Total real estate inventories and total assets for each of our reportable segments, as of the date indicated, were as follows (in thousands):

-   11   - 

5. 
    Receivables 
     Receivables consisted of the following (in thousands): 

6. 
    Real Estate Inventories 
     Real estate inventories consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Homes completed or under construction is comprised of costs associated with homes in various stages of construction and includes direct construction and related land acquisition and land development costs. Land under development primarily consists of land acquisition and land development costs, which include capitalized interest and real estate taxes, associated with land undergoing improvement activity. Land held for future development principally reflects land acquisition and land development costs related to land where development activity has not yet begun or has been suspended, but is expected to occur in the future. 
  Real estate inventories not owned represents deposits related to land purchase and land and lot option agreements as well as consolidated inventory held by variable interest entities. For further details, see Note 8,   Variable Interest Entities  . 
  In June of 2016, our Pardee Homes reporting segment sold two parcels, totaling   102   homebuilding lots, located in the Pacific Highlands Ranch community in San Diego, California.  The land sold in these sales were classified as land under development and represented   $61.6 million   of land and lot sales revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Interest incurred, capitalized and expensed were as follows (in thousands): 

-   12   - 

Interest is capitalized to real estate inventory during development and other qualifying activities. Interest that is capitalized to real estate inventory is included in cost of home sales or cost of land and lot sales as related units or lots are delivered.  Interest that is expensed as incurred is included in other income, net. 
  Real estate inventory impairments and land and lot option abandonments 
  Land and lot option abandonments and pre-acquisition charges were as follows (in thousands): 

Impairments of real estate inventory relate primarily to projects or communities that include homes completed or under construction. Within a project or community, there may be individual homes or parcels of land that are currently held for sale. Impairment charges recognized as a result of adjusting individual held-for-sale assets within a community to estimated fair value less cost to sell are also included in the total impairment charges above.  Charges for inventory impairments are expensed to cost of sales.  
  In addition to owning land and residential lots, we also have option agreements to purchase land and lots at a future date. We have option deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs associated with the optioned land and lots. When the economics of a project no longer support acquisition of the land or lots under option, we may elect not to move forward with the acquisition. Option deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs associated with the assets under option may be forfeited at that time. Charges for such forfeitures are expensed to cost of sales. 

7. 
    Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we held equity investments in   five   active homebuilding partnerships or limited liability companies and   one   financial services limited liability company. Our participation in these entities may be as a developer, a builder, or an investment partner. Our ownership percentage varies from   7%   to   55%  , depending on the investment, with no controlling interest held in any of these investments. 
  Investments Held 
  Our cumulative investment in entities accounted for on the equity method, including our share of earnings and losses, consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Unconsolidated Financial Information 
  Aggregated assets, liabilities and operating results of the entities we account for as equity-method investments are provided below.

8. 
    Variable Interest Entities 
     In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option agreements in order to procure land and residential lots for future development and the construction of homes. The use of such land and lot option agreements generally allows us to reduce the risks associated with direct land ownership and development, and reduces our capital and financial commitments. Pursuant to these land and lot option agreements, we generally provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. Such deposits are recorded as land purchase and land option deposits under real estate inventories not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  We analyze each of our land and lot option agreements and other similar contracts under the provisions of ASC 810   Consolidation   to determine whether the land seller is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. Although we do not have legal title to the underlying land, if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we will consolidate the VIE in our financial statements and reflect its assets as real estate inventory not owned included in our real estate inventories, its liabilities as debt (nonrecourse) held by VIEs in accrued expenses and other liabilities and the net equity of the VIE owners as noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary, we consider, among other things, whether we have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. Such activities would include, among other things, determining or limiting the scope or purpose of the VIE, selling or transferring property owned or controlled by the VIE, or arranging financing for the VIE. 
  Creditors of the entities with which we have land and lot option agreements have no recourse against us. The maximum exposure to loss under our land and lot option agreements is limited to non-refundable option deposits and any capitalized pre-acquisition costs. In some cases, we have also contracted to complete development work at a fixed cost on behalf of the land owner and budget shortfalls and savings will be borne by us.

On April 28, 2016, the Company partially exercised the accordion feature under its existing unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) to increase the total commitments under the Credit Facility to   $625 million   from   $550 million  .  The Credit Facility matures on   May 18, 2019  , and contains a sublimit of   $75 million   for letters of credit. The Company may borrow under the Credit Facility in the ordinary course of business to fund its operations, including its land acquisition, land development and homebuilding activities. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will be governed by, among other things, a borrowing base. Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility will be based on either a daily Eurocurrency base rate or a Eurocurrency rate, in either case, plus a spread ranging from   1.45%   to   2.20%  , depending on the Company s leverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was   $200.0 million   with an interest rate of   2.28%   per annum and   $420.7 million   of availability after considering the borrowing base provisions and outstanding letters of credit.

    Fair Value Disclosures 
     Fair Value Measurements 
  ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  , defines  fair value  as the price that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at measurement date and requires assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed in the following three categories: 
             
    Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
                
    Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are inactive; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets at measurement date 
                
    Level 3 Valuations derived from techniques where one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable in active markets at measurement date

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  A summary of assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , related to our financial instruments, measured at fair value on a recurring basis, is set forth below (in thousands): 

__________ 
             (2)   
    The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016   is based on a treasury curve analysis.  We believe that the carrying value of the Credit Facility approximated fair value at   December 31, 2015   due to the short term nature of the current rate amended on May 18, 2015. 
        
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and receivables approximated fair value. 
    
  Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets 
  Nonfinancial assets include items such as real estate inventories and long-lived assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value is not recoverable. The following table presents impairment charges and the remaining net fair value for nonfinancial assets that were measured during the periods presented (in thousands): 
   
 _______________ 
            (1)   
    Fair value of real estate inventories, net of impairment charges represents only those assets whose carrying values were adjusted to fair value in the respective periods presented. The fair value of these real estate inventories impaired was determined based on recent offers received from outside third parties or actual contracts.

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Legal Matters 
  Lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been and may be instituted or asserted against us in the normal course of business, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. We are also subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations related to land development activities, house construction standards, sales practices, employment practices, environmental protection and financial services.  As a result, we are subject to periodic examinations or inquiry by agencies administering these laws and regulations. 
  We record a reserve for potential legal claims and regulatory matters when they are probable of occurring and a potential loss is reasonably estimable. We accrue for these matters based on facts and circumstances specific to each matter and revise these estimates when necessary.  In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting outcomes of legal claims and related contingencies, we generally cannot predict their ultimate resolution, related timing or eventual loss. Accordingly, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any matter, if in excess of a related accrual or if no accrual was made, could be material to our financial statements.  For matters as to which the Company believes a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we had legal reserves of   $225,000   and   $450,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Warranty 
  Warranty reserves are accrued as home deliveries occur. Our warranty reserves on homes delivered will vary based on product type and geographic area and also depending on state and local laws. The warranty reserve is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and represents expected future costs based on our historical experience over previous years. Estimated warranty costs are charged to cost of home sales in the period in which the related home sales revenue is recognized. 
  We maintain general liability insurance designed to protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from construction-related claims. We also generally require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for liabilities arising from their work, subject to various limitations. However, such indemnity is significantly limited with respect to a significant majority of our subcontractors, which are enrolled in our general liability insurance policy. Included in our warranty reserve accrual are allowances to cover our estimated costs of self-insured retentions and deductible amounts under these policies and estimated costs for claims that may not be covered by applicable insurance or indemnities. Estimation of these accruals include consideration of our claims history, including current claims and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported.  In addition, management estimates warranty reserves and allowances necessary to cover any current or future construction-related claims based on actuarial analysis.  Under this analysis, reserve amounts are estimated using our historical expense and claim data, as well as industry data.  In addition, we record expected recoveries from insurance carriers when proceeds are probable and estimable.  Outstanding warranty insurance receivables were   $9.7 million   and   $10.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Warranty insurance receivables are recorded in receivables on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  There can be no assurance that our warranty reserves will sufficiently cover the costs of future warranty claims made by homebuyers, that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates, that we will not be liable for damages, cost of repairs, and/or the expense of litigation surrounding possible construction defects, soil subsidence or building related claims or that claims will not arise out of uninsurable events or circumstances not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with certain subcontractors. 
  Warranty reserves consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Performance Bonds 
  We obtain surety bonds in the normal course of business to ensure completion of certain infrastructure improvements of our projects. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had outstanding surety bonds totaling   $433.6 million   and   $414.1 million  , respectively. The beneficiaries of the bonds are various municipalities.

    Stock-Based Compensation 
     2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
  The Company s stock compensation plan, the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2013 Incentive Plan ), was adopted by TRI Pointe in January 2013 and amended, with the approval of our stockholders, in 2014 and 2015.  In addition, our board of directors amended the 2013 Incentive Plan in 2014 to prohibit repricing (other than in connection with any equity restructuring or any change in capitalization) of outstanding options or stock appreciation rights without stockholder approval.  The 2013 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of equity-based awards, including options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights, bonus stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards. The 2013 Incentive Plan will automatically expire on the tenth anniversary of its effective date. Our board of directors may terminate or amend the 2013 Incentive Plan at any time, subject to any requirement of stockholder approval required by applicable law, rule or regulation. 
  As amended, the number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the 2013 Incentive Plan is   11,727,833   shares. To the extent that shares of our common stock subject to an outstanding option, stock appreciation right, stock award or performance award granted under the 2013 Incentive Plan are not issued or delivered by reason of the expiration, termination, cancellation or forfeiture of such award or the settlement of such award in cash, then such shares of our common stock generally shall again be available under the 2013 Incentive Plan. As of   September 30, 2016   there were   7,604,642   shares available for future grant under the 2013 Incentive Plan. 
  Converted Awards 
  On July 16, 2014, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 (Registration No. 333-197461) to register   4,105,953   shares of common stock related to converted equity awards issued in connection with the Company's acquisition of WRECO. The converted awards have the same terms and conditions as the prior equity awards except that all performance share units were surrendered in exchange for time-vesting restricted stock units without any performance-based vesting conditions or requirements and the exercise price of each converted stock option is equal to the original exercise price divided by an exchange ratio of   2.1107  , rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of common stock.  There will be no future grants under the WRECO equity incentive plans.   
  The following table presents compensation expense recognized related to all stock-based awards (in thousands): 

Stock-based compensation is charged to general and administrative expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to all stock-based awards was   $20.3 million   and the weighted average term over which the expense was expected to be recognized was   1.9 years  . 
  Summary of Stock Option Activity 
  The following table presents a summary of stock option awards for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

-   21   - 

The intrinsic value of each stock option award outstanding or exercisable is the difference between the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the end of the period and the exercise price of each stock option award to the extent it is considered  in-the-money . A stock option award is considered to be  in-the-money  if the fair market value of the Company s stock is greater than the exercise price of the stock option award. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable represents the value that would have been received by the holders of stock option awards had they exercised their stock option award on the last trading day of the period and sold the underlying shares at the closing price on that day. 
    
  Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity 
  The following table presents a summary of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

On March 5, 2015, the Company granted an aggregate of   440,800   time-vested RSUs to employees and officers. The RSUs granted vest in equal installments annually on the anniversary of the grant date over a   three years   period.  The fair value of each RSU granted on March 5, 2015 was measured using a price of   $14.97   per share, which was the closing stock price on the date of grant.  Each award will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
  On March 9, 2015, the Company granted   411,804  ,   384,351  , and   274,536   performance-based RSUs to the Company s Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, with 1/3 of the performance-based RSU amounts being allocated to each of the three following separate performance goals: total shareholder return (compared to a group of peer homebuilding companies); earnings per share; and stock price. The performance-based RSUs granted will vest in each case, if at all, based on the percentage of attainment of the applicable performance goal. The performance periods for the performance-based RSUs with vesting based on total shareholder return and earnings per share are   January 1, 2015   to   December 31, 2017  . The performance period for the performance-based RSUs with vesting based on stock price is   January 1, 2016   to   December 31, 2017  . The fair value of the performance-based RSUs related to the total shareholder return and stock price performance goals was determined to be   $7.55   and   $7.90   per share, respectively, based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of the performance-based RSUs related to the earnings per share goal was measured using a price of   $14.57   per share, which was the closing stock price on the date of grant. Each grant will be expensed over the requisite service period. 
    
  On August 12, 2015, the Company granted an aggregate of   69,008   RSUs to the non-employee members of its board of directors. These RSUs vested in their entirety on June 6, 2016. The fair value of each RSU granted on August 12, 2015 was measured using   $14.49   per share, which was the closing price on the date of grant. Each award was expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
  On March 1, 2016, the Company granted an aggregate of   1,120,677   time-vested RSUs to employees and officers. The RSUs granted vest in equal installments annually on the anniversary of the grant date over a   three   year period.  The fair value of each RSU granted on March 1, 2016 was measured using a price of   $10.49   per share, which was the closing stock price on the date of grant.  Each award will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
  
   -   22   - 

On March 1, 2016, the Company granted   297,426  ,   285,986   and   125,834   performance-based RSUs to the Company s Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. The vesting, if at all, of these performance-based RSUs may range from   0%   to   100%   and will be based on the Company s percentage attainment of specified threshold, target and maximum performance goals. The percentage of these performance-based RSUs that vest will be determined by comparing the Company s total stockholder return to the total stockholder returns of a group of peer homebuilding companies. The performance period for these performance-based RSUs is   January 1, 2016   to   December 31, 2018  . These performance-based RSUs will not vest if the Company s total stockholder return from   January 1, 2016   to   December 31, 2018   is not a positive number, provided that the executive will thereafter become vested in the award units, or portion thereof, that would have otherwise vested on December 31, 2018 if on any day after December 31, 2018 and on or before December 31, 2020, the Company s total stockholder return is greater than zero and the executive is employed by the Company on that date. If the performance-based RSUs have not vested on or before December 31, 2020, such performance-based RSUs shall be cancelled and forfeited for no consideration. The fair value of these performance-based RSUs was determined to be   $4.76   per share based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Each award will be expensed over the requisite service period. 
  On June 6, 2016, the Company granted an aggregate of   74,466   RSUs to the non-employee members of its board of directors. These RSUs vest in their entirety on the day immediately prior to the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The fair value of each RSU granted on June 6, 2016 was measured using a price of   $11.75   per share, which was the closing stock price on the date of grant. Each award will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  
  As RSUs vest for employees, a portion of the shares awarded is generally withheld to cover employee tax withholdings. As a result, the number of RSUs vested and the number of shares of TRI Pointe common stock issued will differ. 

16. 
    Stock Repurchase Program 
     On January 27, 2016, the Company announced that the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of the Company s common stock with an aggregate value of up to   $100 million   through January 25, 2017.  Purchases of common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a broker-dealer at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act.  We are not obligated under the program to repurchase any specific number or amount of shares of common stock, and we may modify, suspend or discontinue the program at any time.  Our management will determine the timing and amount of repurchase in its discretion based on a variety of factors, such as the market price of our common stock, corporate requirements, general market economic conditions and legal requirements.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   852,500   shares of our common stock were repurchased and retired under this program at an average price of   $12.22   per share for a total cost of   $10.4 million  .  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   2,105,521   shares of our common stock were repurchased and retired under this program at an average price of   $11.93   per share for a total of cost of   $25.1 million  .  Subsequent to September 30, 2016 and through the date of this filing, the Company repurchased and retired an additional   618,532   shares of our common stock under this program at an average price of   $12.43   per share for a total cost of   $7.7 million  . 

We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,   Income Taxes   ( ASC 740 ), which requires an asset and liability approach for measuring deferred taxes based on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the years in which taxes are expected to be paid or recovered.  Each quarter we assess our deferred tax asset to determine whether all or any portion of the asset is more likely than not unrealizable under ASC 740.  We are required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of the asset we conclude is more likely than not to be unrealizable.  Our assessment considers, among other things, the nature, frequency and severity of our current and cumulative losses, forecasts of our future taxable income, the duration of statutory carryforward periods and tax planning alternatives. 
  We had net deferred tax assets of   $111.9 million   and   $130.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  We had a valuation allowance related to those net deferred tax assets of   $3.5 million   and   $4.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company will continue to evaluate both positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. Changes in positive and negative evidence, including differences between the Company's future operating results and the estimates utilized in the determination of the valuation allowance, could result in changes in the Company's estimate of the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets.

  2019 Notes and 2024 Notes 
  TRI Pointe Group and TRI Pointe Homes are co-issuers of the 2019 Notes and the 2024 Notes. All of the Guarantors (other than TRI Pointe Homes) have entered into supplemental indentures pursuant to which they jointly and severally guarantee the obligations of TRI Pointe Group and TRI Pointe Homes with respect to the 2019 Notes and the 2024 Notes.

  Formation of TRI Pointe Group 
  On July 7, 2015, TRI Pointe Homes reorganized its corporate structure (the  Reorganization ) whereby TRI Pointe Homes became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe Group.  As a result of the Reorganization, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of TRI Pointe Homes ( Homes Common Stock ) was cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of TRI Pointe Group ( Group Common Stock ), each share having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof as the shares of Homes Common Stock being so converted.  TRI Pointe Group, as the successor issuer to TRI Pointe Homes (pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act), began making filings under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act on July 7, 2015. 
  In connection with the Reorganization, TRI Pointe Group (i) became a co-issuer of TRI Pointe Homes  4.375% Senior Notes due 2019 and TRI Pointe Homes' 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024; and (ii) replaced TRI Pointe Homes as the borrower under TRI Pointe Homes  existing unsecured revolving credit facility. 
  The business, executive officers and directors of TRI Pointe Group, and the rights and limitations of the holders of Group Common Stock immediately following the Reorganization were identical to the business, executive officers and directors of TRI Pointe Homes, and the rights and limitations of holders of Homes Common Stock immediately prior to the Reorganization.

Overview and Outlook 
  We continue to be encouraged by the strength of the overall U.S. new-home market, which continues to improve on a slow, sustainable growth trajectory, supported by stronger general economic conditions, low unemployment levels, modest wage gains, low interest rates, and increasing consumer confidence combined with a limited supply of new homes.  We believe demand will continue to be strong across the U.S. in general and in a majority of the markets in which we operate over the next several years. Nevertheless, we continue to see variability from market to market with demand generally driven by general local market economic conditions.  Homebuilding activity in many markets continues to be constrained by land and labor availability, as well as fee increases and delays imposed by local municipalities, which we expect will continue to constrict supply.  We expect these demand and supply trends will result in a continued slow and steady recovery in the homebuilding market.  See "Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements".  
  Our third quarter 2016 results reflect a decrease in net income available to common stockholders of 31% as compared to the prior year period due primarily to a 10% decrease in new home deliveries and a 90 basis point decrease in homebuilding gross margin percentage.  The decline in new home deliveries was largely due to the timing of deliveries, as we delivered a large number of our backlog units in the second quarter of 2016, and a lower number of backlog units going into the quarter compared to the prior year period. The decline in homebuilding gross margins was primarily due to the mix of deliveries, including an 11% decrease in deliveries in California, which have generally had higher margins than the Company average.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income available to common stockholders increased 14% as compared to the prior year period as a result of a 7% increase in deliveries and a 140 basis point increase in homebuilding gross margin percentage.

Consolidated Financial Data (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Net New Home Orders, Average Selling Communities and Monthly Absorption Rates by Segment 

-   37   - 

Net new home orders for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by 64 units or 6% to   932  , compared to   996   during the prior year period.  Average selling communities decreased slightly to   119.0   from   120.8   for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  The decrease in net new home orders at Pardee Homes was primarily due to a 10% decrease in average selling communities, although absorption rates increased slightly.  The significant decrease in net new home orders at Quadrant Homes was primarily due to a 38% decrease in average selling communities as a result of the timing of new community openings and closings and to a lesser extent, a decrease in absorption pace.  The decrease in net new home orders at Maracay Homes and Winchester Homes was mainly due to slower absorption rates. 
  Backlog Units, Dollar Value and Average Sales Price by Segment (dollars in thousands) 

Backlog units reflect the number of homes, net of actual cancellations experienced during the period, for which we have entered into sales contracts with customers but for which we have not yet delivered the homes. Homes in backlog are generally delivered within three to nine months, although we may experience cancellations of sales contracts prior to delivery. Our cancellation rate of buyers who contracted to buy a home but did not close escrow (as a percentage of overall orders) was 17% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 16% for the prior year period.  The dollar value of backlog was   $950.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $159.7 million  , or   14%  , compared to   $1.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in dollar value of backlog was due to a decline in backlog units to   1,711   as of   September 30, 2016   from   1,856   as of   September 30, 2015  , representing $86.7 million of the decline.  Additionally, a 7% decrease in the average sales price of homes in backlog to $555,000 as of   September 30, 2016   from $598,000 as of   September 30, 2015  , impacted the decrease in dollar value of backlog by $73.0 million.  The average sales price of homes in backlog decreased as a result of our Pardee Homes and TRI Pointe Homes segments closing out of communities with higher average sales prices resulting in a decrease in average sales price at the active selling communities in those segments. 
  New Homes Delivered, Homes Sales Revenue and Average Sales Price by Segment (dollars in thousands) 

-   38   - 

Home sales revenue decreased   $63.7 million  , or   10%  , to   $578.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $642.4 million   for the prior year period. The decrease was comprised of: (i) $67.2 million related to a 10% decrease in homes delivered to   1,019   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   1,138   in the prior year period; and (ii) offset by an increase of $3.5 million due to an increase in average sales price of $4,000 per home to $568,000 for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $564,000 in the prior year period.  The decrease in new home deliveries for the quarter was largely due to the timing of deliveries, as we delivered a large number of our backlog units in the second quarter of 2016, and had a lower number of backlog units going into the quarter compared to the prior year. 
  Homebuilding Gross Margins (dollars in thousands) 

__________ 
            (1)   
    Non-GAAP financial measure (as discussed below). 
     Our homebuilding gross margin percentage decreased to   20.1%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   21.0%   for the prior year period.  The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the mix of deliveries, particularly the 11% decrease in deliveries from our TRI Pointe Homes and Pardee Homes segments in California, which produce gross margins above the Company average. Excluding interest and impairment and lot option abandonments in cost of home sales, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was   22.7%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   23.1%   for the prior year period. The decrease in the adjusted homebuilding gross margin was consistent with the change in homebuilding gross margin. 
  Adjusted homebuilding gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that leverage and noncash charges have on homebuilding gross margin and permits investors to make better comparisons with our competitors, who adjust gross margins in a similar fashion. Because adjusted homebuilding gross margin is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  See the table above reconciling this non-GAAP financial measure to homebuilding gross margin, the nearest GAAP equivalent. 
  Land and Lot Gross Margins (dollars in thousands) 

Our land and lot gross margin percentage increased to   31.6%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   29.2%   for the prior year period.  Land and lot sales gross margin percentage can vary significantly due to the type of land and its related cost basis. 
  
   -   39   - 

Sales and Marketing, General and Administrative Expense (dollars in thousands) 

Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of home sales revenue increased to   5.5%   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   4.7%   for the prior year period.  The increase was the result of lower operating leverage on the fixed components of sales and marketing expenses as a result of the 10% decrease in homes sales revenue.  Total sales and marketing expense increased by   $1.8 million   to   $31.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $30.0 million   in the same prior year period, and is primarily attributable to an increase in broker co-op payments and opening more communities in the quarter compared to the prior year period.  
  General and administrative ( G A ) expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue increased to   5.4%   of home sales revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   4.2%   for the prior year period.  The increase is due primarily to decreased operating leverage resulting from the 10% decrease in home sales revenue. G A expenses increased to   $31.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $26.7 million   in the same prior year period primarily as a result of additional headcount to support future growth. 
  Total sales and marketing and G A ( SG A ) as a percentage of home sales revenue increased to   10.9%   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   8.8%   in the prior year period.  Total SG A expense increased   $6.2 million  , or 11.0%, to   $63.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $56.8 million   in the prior year period.   
  Restructuring Charges 
  Restructuring charges decreased to   $128,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.0 million   in the same period in the prior year.  The decrease was mainly due to lower lease termination costs in 2016. 
  Interest 
  Interest, which was incurred principally to finance land acquisitions, land development and home construction, totaled   $18.6 million   and   $15.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  All interest incurred in both periods was capitalized.  The increase in interest incurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior year period was primarily attributable to an increase in our debt balance and our weighted average interest rate as a result of the issuance of our 2021 Notes in May of 2016. 
  Income Tax 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a tax provision of   $20.3 million   based on an effective tax rate of   36.6%  .  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded a tax provision of $  28.0 million   based on an effective tax rate of   36.0%  . The decrease in provision for income taxes is due to a decrease in income before income taxes of   $22.3 million   to   $55.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $77.8 million   for the prior year period.  The increase in the effective tax rate was the result of discrete tax adjustments recorded during the quarter. 

-   40   - 

Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Net New Home Orders, Average Selling Communities and Monthly Absorption Rates by Segment 

Net new home orders for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   89   units, or   3%  , to   3,339  , compared to   3,428   during the prior year period.  The decrease in net new home orders at Quadrant Homes was primarily due to a decrease in average selling communities as a result of timing of new community openings and closings.  The decrease in net new home orders at TRI Pointe Homes was mainly due to a decrease in absorptions rates, although absorptions remained strong at 3.6 orders per community per month.  Maracay Homes' orders increased 6% as a result of increased communities while Winchester Homes' orders increased 8% due to increased absorption as a result of better market conditions.    
  New Homes Delivered, Homes Sales Revenue and Average Sales Price by Segment (dollars in thousands) 

Home sales revenue increased   $114.8 million  , or   8%  , to   $1.6 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $1.4 billion   for the prior year period. The increase was comprised of: (i) $99.8 million related to a 7% increase in homes delivered to   2,784   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   2,604   in the prior year period; and (ii) $15.0 million due to an increase in average sales price of $6,000 per home to $560,000 for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from $554,000 in the prior year period.

Homebuilding Gross Margins (dollars in thousands) 

__________ 
            (1)   
    Non-GAAP financial measure (as discussed below). 
     Our homebuilding gross margin percentage increased to   21.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   20.4%   for the prior year period.  The increase in gross margin was primarily due to mix of deliveries, particularly the 13% increase in deliveries from our TRI Pointe Homes and Pardee Homes segments in California, which produce gross margins above the Company average. Excluding interest and impairment and lot option abandonments in cost of home sales, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was   24.0%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   22.4%   for the prior year period. The increase in the adjusted homebuilding gross margin was consistent with the change in homebuilding gross margin. 
  Adjusted homebuilding gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that leverage and noncash charges have on homebuilding gross margin and permits investors to make better comparisons with our competitors, who adjust gross margins in a similar fashion. Because adjusted homebuilding gross margin is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  See the table above reconciling this non-GAAP financial measure to homebuilding gross margin, the nearest GAAP equivalent. 
  Land and Lot Gross Margins (dollars in thousands) 

Our land and lot gross margin percentage was   75.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   76.7%   for the same prior year period.  In June of 2016, our Pardee Homes reporting segment sold two parcels, totaling 102 homebuilding lots, located in the Pacific Highlands Ranch community in San Diego, California.  Pardee Homes received $61.6 million in cash proceeds from the sales.  In June of 2015 our Pardee Homes reporting segment sold a commercial site in the Pacific Highlands Ranch community for $53.0 million in cash proceeds.  These transactions involving the Pacific Highlands Ranch community included significant gross margins due to the low land basis of the community which was acquired in 1981.   Land and lot sales gross margin percentage can vary significantly due to the type of land and its related cost basis. 
  Sales and Marketing, General and Administrative Expense (dollars in thousands) 

-   42   - 

Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of home sales revenue increased to   5.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   5.5%   for the prior year period.  The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in active selling communities, as well as pre-marketing efforts for new communities opening in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the expansion into the Austin, Texas and Los Angeles, California markets.  Total sales and marketing expense increased by   $11.7 million   to   $90.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $79.0 million   in the same prior year period, and is primarily attributable to direct selling costs related to the   7%   increase in new home deliveries, an increase in broker co-op payments and opening more communities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. 
  G A expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue remained flat at   5.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  G A expenses increased to   $89.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $83.2 million   in the same prior year period as a result of additional headcount to support future growth. 
  Total SG A as a percentage of home sales revenue increased to   11.6%   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   11.2%   in the prior year period.  Total SG A expense increased   $18.3 million  , or 11.2%, to   $180.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $162.1 million   in the prior year period.   
  Restructuring Charges 
  Restructuring charges decreased to $478,000 for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.7 million   in the same period in the prior year.  The decrease was due to lower lease termination and severance costs in 2016. 
  Interest 
  Interest, which was incurred principally to finance land acquisitions, land development and home construction, totaled   $50.0 million   and   $45.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  All interest incurred in both periods was capitalized.  The increase in interest incurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior year period was primarily attributable to an increase in our weighted average interest rate as a result of the issuance of our 2021 Notes in May of 2016. 
  Income Tax 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a tax provision of $  77.7 million   based on an effective tax rate of   36.0%  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded a tax provision of $  66.1 million   based on an effective tax rate of   35.2%  . The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes of   $27.8 million   to   $215.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $187.9 million   for the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate was the result of discrete tax adjustments recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  Our principal uses of capital for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were operating expenses, land purchases, land development and home construction. We used funds generated by our operations and available borrowings to meet our short-term working capital requirements. We remain focused on generating positive margins in our homebuilding operations and acquiring desirable land positions in order to maintain a strong balance sheet and keep us poised for growth. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $128.7 million   of cash and cash equivalents. We believe we have sufficient cash and sources of financing to fund operations for at least the next twelve months. 
  Our board of directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our Company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. Our charter does not contain a limitation on the amount of debt we may incur and our board of directors may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders. 
  Senior Notes 
  In May 2016, TRI Pointe Group issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the  2021 Notes ) at 99.44% of their aggregate principal amount.  Net proceeds of this issuance was   $293.9 million  , after debt issuance costs and discounts.  The 2021 Notes mature on July 1, 2021 and interest is paid semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1. 
  
   -   44   - 

TRI Pointe Group and TRI Pointe Homes are co-issuers of $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2019 ( 2019 Notes ) and $450 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 ( 2024 Notes ).  The 2019 Notes were issued at   98.89%   of their aggregate principal amount and the 2024 Notes were issued at   98.15%   of their aggregate principal amount. The net proceeds from the offering were   $861.3 million  , after debt issuance costs and discounts.  The 2019 Notes and 2024 Notes mature on June 15, 2019 and June 15, 2024.   Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   principal has been paid on the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes (together, the "Senior Notes"), and there was   $22.0 million   of capitalized debt financing costs, included in senior notes, net on our consolidated balance sheet, related to the Senior Notes that will amortize over the lives of the Senior Notes. Accrued interest related to the Senior Notes was   $18.6 million   and   $1.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility 
  On April 28 2016, the Company partially exercised the accordion feature under its existing unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) to increase the total commitments under the Credit Facility to   $625 million   from   $550 million  .  The Credit Facility matures on   May 18, 2019  , and contains a sublimit of   $75 million   for letters of credit. The Company may borrow under the Credit Facility in the ordinary course of business to fund its operations, including its land development and homebuilding activities. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will be governed by, among other things, a borrowing base. The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants relating to consolidated tangible net worth, leverage, and liquidity or interest coverage. Interest rates on borrowings will be based on either a daily Eurocurrency base rate or a Eurocurrency rate, in either case, plus a spread ranging from 1.45% to 2.20% depending on the Company s leverage ratio.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was   $200.0 million   with an interest rate   2.28%   per annum and   $420.7 million   of availability after considering the borrowing base provisions and outstanding letters of credit.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding letters of credit of   $4.3 million  .  These letters of credit were issued to secure various financial obligations.  We believe it is not probable that any outstanding letters of credit will be drawn upon. 
  Seller Financed Loan 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $17.8 million   outstanding related to a seller financed loan to acquire lots for the construction of homes.  Principal and interest payments on this loan are due at various maturity dates, including at the time individual homes associated with the acquired land are delivered.  The seller financed loan accrues interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum, with interest calculated on a daily basis.  A minimum principal payment of $12.1 million is due in June 2017 with any remaining unpaid balance due in June 2018. 
  Stock Repurchase Program 
  On January 27, 2016, the Company announced that the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of the Company s common stock with an aggregate value of up to   $100 million   through January 25, 2017.  Purchases of common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a broker-dealer at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act.  We are not obligated under the program to repurchase any specific number or amount of shares of common stock, and we may modify, suspend or discontinue the program at any time.  Our management will determine the timing and amount of repurchase in its discretion based on a variety of factors, such as the market price of our common stock, corporate requirements, general market economic conditions and legal requirements.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   2,105,521   shares of our common stock had been repurchased and retired under this program at an average price of   $11.93   per share for a total of cost of   $25.1 million  .

Covenant Compliance 
  Under our Credit Facility, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the table below (dollars in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of these financial covenants. 
  Leverage Ratios 
  We believe that our leverage ratios provide useful information to the users of our financial statements regarding our financial position and cash and debt management. The ratio of debt-to-capital and the ratio of net debt-to-capital are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):   

__________ 
            (1)   
    The ratio of debt-to-capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing debt by the sum of total debt plus equity. 
               (2)   
    The ratio of net debt-to-capital is a non-GAAP measure and is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing net debt (which is debt less cash and cash equivalents) by the sum of net debt plus equity. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of debt-to-capital. We believe the ratio of net debt-to-capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing. See the table above reconciling this non-GAAP financial measure to the ratio of debt-to-capital.  Because the ratio of net debt-to-capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Cash Flows   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the comparison of cash flows is as follows: 
             
    Net cash used in operating activities increased by   $121.3 million   to   $261.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $140.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change was comprised of offsetting activity, including (i) an increase in real estate inventories of   $442.7 million   in 2016 compared to an increase of $305.9 million in 2015 to support our future community count growth and (ii) other offsetting activity included changes in other assets, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and net income. 
                
    Net cash used in investing activities was   $2.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.2 million   for the same prior year period in 2015.  The decrease in cash used in investing activities was due mainly due to lower investments in unconsolidated entities, offset by increases in the purchase of property and equipment. 
                
    Net cash provided by financing activities increased to   $177.6 million   for the   nine   months ending   September 30, 2016   from   $68.6 million   for the same period in the prior year. The change was primarily a result of higher net borrowings from debt of $214.2 million during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $82.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , offset by an increase in spending related to the share repurchase program of $25.1 million during the current year period with no comparable prior year activity.   
     As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents balance was   $128.7 million  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option contracts in order to procure lots for the construction of our homes.  We are subject to customary obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase of land and improved lots.  These purchase contracts typically require a cash deposit and the purchase of properties under these contracts is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the sellers, including obtaining applicable property and development entitlements.  We also utilize option contracts with land sellers as a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns, to help us manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings, and to reduce the use of funds from our corporate financing sources.  Option contracts generally require a non-refundable deposit for the right to acquire land and lots over a specified period of time at pre-determined prices.  We generally have the right, at our discretion, to terminate our obligations under both purchase contracts and option contracts by forfeiting our cash deposit with no further financial responsibility to the land seller.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $30.2 million   of cash deposits, the majority of which are non-refundable, pertaining to land and lot option contracts and purchase contracts with an aggregate remaining purchase price of   $445.1 million   (net of deposits). 
  Our utilization of land and lot option contracts is dependent on, among other things, the availability of land sellers willing to enter into option takedown arrangements, the availability of capital to finance the development of optioned land and lots, general housing market conditions, and local market dynamics.  Options may be more difficult to procure from land sellers in strong housing markets and are more prevalent in certain geographic regions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $420.7 million   of availability under our Credit Facility after considering the borrowing base provisions and outstanding letters of credit. 
  Inflation 
  Our operations can be adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher land, financing, labor, material and construction costs.  In addition, inflation can lead to higher mortgage rates, which can significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to homebuyers.  While we attempt to pass on cost increases to customers through increased prices, when weak housing market conditions exist, we are often unable to offset cost increases with higher selling prices.  
  
   -   47   - 

Seasonality 
  Historically, the homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results and capital requirements.  We typically experience the highest new home order activity during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors.  Since it typically takes three to nine months to construct a new home, the number of homes delivered and associated home sales revenue typically increases in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year as new home orders sold earlier in the year convert to home deliveries.  Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the second half of the year.  We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statement contained elsewhere in this report and the audited financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   describe the significant accounting policies essential to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions that we have used are appropriate and correct based on information available at the time they were made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect our reported assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the period presented. If there is a material difference between these estimates, judgments and assumptions and actual facts, our financial statements may be affected. 
  In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require our judgment in its application. There are areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result, but there are some areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would produce a materially different result. See the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
       
  We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our outstanding debt.  We did not utilize swaps, forward or option contracts on interest rates or commodities, or other types of derivative financial instruments as of or during the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  We did not enter into during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and currently do not hold, derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
       
  We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (the  Principal Executive Officer ) and Chief Financial Officer (the  Principal Financial Officer ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of senior management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change occurred during the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
     On January 27, 2016, we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of our common stock with an aggregate value of up to $100 million through January 25, 2017.  Purchases of common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a broker-dealer at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act.  We are not obligated under the program to repurchase any specific number or amount of shares of common stock, and we may modify, suspend or discontinue the program at any time.  Our management will determine the timing and amount of repurchase in its discretion based on a variety of factors, such as the market price of our common stock, corporate requirements, general market economic conditions and legal requirements.   
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased the following shares under our repurchase program: 

__________ 
   (1)        During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was an aggregate of   852,500   and   2,105,521   shares of common stock repurchased for   $10.4 million   and   $25.1 million  , respectively.  No shares of common stock were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2015.
