  Performance Summary 
    
  BOK Financial Corporation ( the Company ) reported net income of   $74.3 million   or   $1.13   per diluted share for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $74.9 million   or   $1.09   per diluted share for the   third quarter of 2015   and   $65.8 million   or   $1.00   per diluted share for the   second quarter of 2016  .  
    
  Highlights of the   third quarter of 2016   included: 
              
    Fees and commissions revenue totaled   $185.3 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  ,   up     $20.7 million   over the   third quarter of 2015  . All revenue categories grew over the prior year, led by mortgage banking and brokerage and trading revenue. Fees and commissions revenue   increase  d   $1.8 million   over the   second quarter of 2016  . Growth in mortgage banking revenue and deposit service charges and fees was partially offset by decreases in brokerage and trading revenue, transaction card revenue and fiduciary and asset management revenue.  
                
    Changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges,   increase  d pre-tax net income by   $1.2 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   ,   decrease  d pre-tax net income by   $4.4 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   decrease  d pre-tax net income by   $1.2 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  
                
    Operating expenses totaled   $262.1 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , an   increase   of   $37.5 million   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Personnel expense   increase  d   $14.1 million   primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense, regular compensation costs and higher employee healthcare costs. Non-personnel expense   increase  d   $23.4 million   largely due to increased mortgage banking expenses, litigation accruals, deposit insurance expense and professional fees and services expense. Operating expenses   increase  d   $7.4 million   over the previous quarter primarily due to increased litigation accruals and deposit insurance expense. 
                  
    Nonperforming assets that are not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies totaled   $253 million   or   1.55 percent   of outstanding loans and repossessed assets (excluding those guaranteed by U.S. government agencies) at   September 30, 2016   and   $251 million   or   1.55 percent   of outstanding loans and repossessed assets (excluding those guaranteed by U.S. government agencies) at   June 30, 2016  . Nonperforming energy loans   decrease  d   $25 million   during the   third   quarter.  
                
    Average loans   increase  d by   $185 million   over the previous quarter due primarily to a   $239 million     increase   in commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a   $156 million     decrease   in commercial loans, primarily due to a paydown of a single energy credit during the quarter. Period-end outstanding loan balances were   $16.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a   $58 million     increase   over   June 30, 2016  .  
                
    Average deposits grew by   $297 million   over the previous quarter primarily due to growth in demand deposit and interest-bearing transaction account balances, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. Period-end deposits were   $21.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $336 million   over   June 30, 2016  .

Results of Operations 
   
  Net Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin 
    
  Net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity. 
    
  Net interest revenue totaled   $187.8 million   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $178.6 million   for the   third quarter of 2015   and   $182.6 million   for the   second quarter of 2016  . Net interest margin was   2.64 percent   for the   third quarter of 2016  ,   2.61 percent   for the   third quarter of 2015   and   2.63 percent   for the   second quarter of 2016  .   
    
  Tax-equivalent net interest revenue   increase  d   $10.4 million   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Table   1   shows the effect on net interest revenue from changes in average balances and interest rates for various types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Tax-equivalent net interest revenue increased   $12.5 million   primarily due to the growth in average loan balances. Net interest revenue decreased   $2.1 million   primarily due to the full quarter impact of the issuance of $150 million of 40 year 5.375% fixed rate subordinated debt in the second quarter that replaced $227 million of floating rating subordinated debt at 1.0105% at September 30, 2015. This floating rate debt was a year from maturity and was phased out from having any benefit to regulatory capital. The longer term fixed rate debt will better position us as interest rates rise. The benefit from a mix shift toward floating rate loans and higher short term interest rates was offset by increased borrowing costs. 
    
  The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was   2.93 percent   for the   third quarter of 2016  ,   up     10 basis points   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Loan yields   increased     9   basis points to   3.63%   primarily due to the growth in variable rate loans and an increase in short-term interest rates. The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents   increase  d   23   basis points. The available for sale securities portfolio yield was unchanged compared to the prior year at   2.01 percent  . Funding costs were   up     12 basis points   over the   third quarter of 2015  . The cost of interest-bearing deposits   decreased     2 basis points  . The cost of other borrowed funds   increased     26 basis points   primarily due to an increase in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter of 2015. The cost of the subordinated debt was up   280   basis points as the existing lower variable rate debt was replaced by higher fixed rate debt. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was   15 basis points   for the   third quarter of 2016  ,   up     5   basis points over the   third quarter of 2015  . 
    
  Average earning assets for the   third quarter of 2016     increased     $1.2 billion   or   4 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses,   increased     $1.2 billion   due primarily to growth in average commercial real estate and commercial loans. The average balance of trading securities   increase  d   $187 million   and the average balance of restricted equity securities   increase  d   $80 million  . The average balance of fair value option securities held as an economic hedge of our mortgage servicing rights   decreased     $163 million   and the average balance of available for sale securities   decreased     $80 million  . The average balance of investment securities decreased compared to the prior year, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of residential mortgage loans held for sale. 
    
  Average deposits   increased     $72 million   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Average demand deposit balances grew by   $502 million  , partially offset by a   $110 million     decrease   in interest-bearing transaction account balances and a   $361 million     decrease   average time deposits. Average savings account balances also grew over the prior year. Average borrowed funds   increased     $1.4 billion   over the   third quarter of 2015  , primarily due to increased borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks. The average balance of subordinated debentures   increased     $30 million  .

Net interest margin   increase  d   1   basis point over the   second quarter of 2016  . The yield on average earning assets   increase  d   2   basis points. The loan portfolio yield   increase  d by   5   basis points to   3.63 percent  . The yield on the available for sale securities portfolio   decrease  d   3 basis point  s to   2.01 percent  . Funding costs were   0.44 percent  ,   up     3 basis point   over the prior quarter. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities   increase  d   2   basis points over the prior quarter.  
  Average earning assets   increase  d   $260 million   over the   second quarter of 2016  . Average loan balances   increase  d   $185 million  , primarily due to growth in commercial real estate balances. Average trading securities balances   increase  d   $129 million   and the average balance of residential mortgage loans held for sale was   up     $45 million  , partially offset by a   $101 million     decrease   in the balance of fair value option securities held as an economic hedge of our mortgage servicing rights.  
  Average deposits   increase  d   $297 million   compared to the previous quarter. Demand deposit balances   increase  d   $335 million   and interest-bearing transaction account balances   increase  d   $60 million  , partially offset by a   $100 million     decrease   in time deposit balances. The average balance of borrowed funds   increase  d   $175 million   over the   second quarter of 2016  . Increased borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks were partially offset by decreased federal funds sold and repurchase agreement balances. 
    
  Our overall objective is to manage the Company s balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk section of this report. Approximately 82% of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will re-price within one year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that re-price more slowly than the loans. The result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally re-price more quickly than liabilities. Among the strategies that we use to manage toward a relatively rate-neutral position, we purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund them with market rate sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio. We also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk.  
    
  The effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table   1   and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.

Other Operating Revenue 
    
  Other operating revenue was   $191.3 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , a   $27.9 million     increase   over the   third quarter of 2015   and a   $2.5 million     increase   over the   second quarter of 2016  . Fees and commissions revenue was   up     $20.7 million   over the   third quarter of 2015   and   increase  d   $1.8 million   over the prior quarter. The change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges,   increase  d other operating revenue by   $1.2 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  ,   decrease  d other operating revenue by   $4.4 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   decrease  d other operating revenue   $1.2 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .

Certain percentage increases (decreases) in non-fees and commissions revenue are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item. 
    
  Fees and commissions revenue 
    
  Diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented   50 percent   of total revenue for the   third quarter of 2016  , excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and consumer spending, all of which can be volatile. As an example of this strength, many of the economic factors that cause net interest revenue compression such as falling interest rates may also drive growth in our mortgage banking revenue. We expect growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and future economic conditions, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases. 
    
  Brokerage and trading revenue includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail brokerage and investment banking. Brokerage and trading revenue   increase  d   $6.4 million   or   20 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  .  

-    5   - 

Trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains primarily related to sales of U.S. government securities, residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and municipal securities to institutional customers and related derivative instruments. Trading revenue was   $12.0 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , an   increase   of   $337 thousand   or   3 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  . The Company added a new group trading in U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities and related to-be-announced derivatives. The addition of this group added $2.0 million of net interest revenue and $1.9 million of trading revenue during the third quarter and added $426 million to the trading securities portfolio at   September 30  . This increase was partially offset by lower volumes of U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities, brokered certificates of deposit and municipal securities sold to our institutional customers. 
    
  Customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note   3   of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Customer hedging revenue totaled   $13.8 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , a   $4.5 million   or   48 percent     increase   over the   third quarter of 2015   primarily due to increased hedging activity by our mortgage banking and energy customers.  
    
  Revenue earned from retail brokerage transactions   increase  d   $932 thousand   or   15 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015   to   $7.0 million  . Retail brokerage revenue is primarily based on fees and commissions earned on sales of fixed income securities, annuities, mutual funds and other financial instruments to retail customers. Revenue is primarily based on the volume of customer transactions and applicable commission rate for each product type. The increase in revenue due to transaction volume growth was partially offset by a change in product mix to products that pay a lower commission rate. In addition, volume has shifted from sales of products that pay a one-time transaction fee to accounts that pay us an on-going management fee.  
    
  Investment banking revenue, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting and financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled   $5.3 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , an   increase   of   $688 thousand   or   15 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Investment banking revenue is primarily related to the timing and volume of completed transactions.  
    
  Brokerage and trading revenue   decrease  d   $1.5 million   compared to the   second quarter of 2016  . Investment banking revenue   decrease  d   $1.7 million   primarily due to the timing and volume of completed transactions. Trading revenue   decrease  d   $307 thousand  . Growth from the addition of our new mortgage trading group was offset by lower volumes of U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities to our institutional customers. Customer hedging revenue   increase  d   $256 thousand   primarily due to increased volumes of contracts with our mortgage banking, partially offset by lower contract volumes with our energy customers. Retail brokerage fees were   up     $228 thousand   over the prior quarter.  
    
  Transaction card revenue depends largely on the volume and amount of transactions processed, the number of TransFund automated teller machine ( ATM ) locations and the number of merchants served. Transaction card revenue for the   third quarter of 2016     increase  d   $1.4 million   or   4 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Revenues from the processing of transactions on behalf of the members of our TransFund electronic funds transfer ("EFT") network totaled   $17.8 million  , a   $1.6 million   or   10 percent     increase   over the prior year. Merchant services fees totaled   $11.3 million  , a   $274 thousand   or   2 percent     decrease   based on decreased transaction activity. Revenue from interchange fees paid by merchants for transactions processed from debit cards issued by the Company totaled   $4.9 million  , an   increase   of   $71 thousand   or   1 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  .  
  Excluding the impact of a $1.2 million customer early termination fee in the second quarter of 2016, transaction card revenue increased $165 thousand primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes on our TransFund EFT network, partially offset by a decrease in merchant services fees and revenue from interchange fees compared to the prior quarter. 
    
  Fiduciary and asset management revenue   increase  d   $3.3 million   or   11 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  , largely due to decreased fee waivers. We earn fees as administrator to and investment adviser for the Cavanal Hill Funds, a diversified, open-ended investment company established as a business trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Bank is custodian and BOK Financial Securities, Inc. is distributor for the Cavanal Hill Funds. Products of the Cavanal Hill Funds are offered to customers, employee benefit plans, trusts and the general public in the ordinary course of business. We have voluntarily waived administration fees on the Cavanal Hill money market funds in order to maintain positive yields on these funds in the current low short-term interest rate environment. Waived fees totaled   $1.6 million   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $3.4 million   for the   third quarter of 2015   and   $1.8 million   for the   second quarter of 2016  . The decrease in fee waivers was related to increased interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2015. The remaining increase is primarily due to growth in assets under management related to the Company's acquisition of Weaver and Tidwell Financial Advisors LTD d/b/a Weaver Wealth Management, a registered investment advisor, in the first quarter of 2016 and changes in market values. 

-    6   - 

Fiduciary and asset management revenue   decrease  d   $740 thousand   compared to the   second quarter of 2016   primarily due to seasonality of annual assessment of tax preparation fees in the second quarter, partially offset by growth in assets under management.  
    
  The fair value of fiduciary assets administered by the Company totaled   $41.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  ,   $37.8 billion   at   September 30, 2015   and   $39.9 billion   at   June 30, 2016  .

  Mortgage banking revenue   increase  d   $9.4 million   or   28%   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Mortgage production revenue   increase  d   $7.3 million   over the prior year. Better gains on sale margins and an increased volume of loans sold was partially offset by a lower volume of mortgage loan commitments.

The Company made a strategic decision to exit the correspondent lending channel during the   third quarter of 2016   based on careful consideration of continued pressure on margin due to the competitive landscape and regulatory costs. This strategic decision decreased outstanding commitments by $289 million compared to the prior year. Mortgage loan commitments continued to grow in our retail and HomeDirect online channels. The correspondent lending channel represented $4.6 million of the total mortgage loan production revenue of   $26.0 million   for the   third quarter of 2016   and $4.0 million of the total mortgage loan production revenue of   $18.7 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  .

Certain percentage increases (decreases) are not meaningful for comparison purposes based on the nature of the item. 
    
  Primary rates disclosed in Table   3   above represent rates generally available to borrowers on 30 year conforming mortgage loans. Secondary rates generally represent yields on 30 year residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.  
  Net gains on securities, derivatives and other assets 
    
  In the   third quarter of 2016  , we recognized a   $2.4 million   net gain from sales of   $232 million   of available for sale securities. Securities were sold either because they had reached their expected maximum potential or to move into securities that are expected to perform better in the current rate environment. In the   third quarter of 2015  , we recognized a   $2.2 million   net gain from sales of   $451 million   of available for sale securities and in the   second quarter of 2016  , we recognized a   $5.3 million   net gain on sales of   $326 million   of available for sale securities.  
    
  We also maintain a portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies, U.S. Treasury securities and interest rate derivative contracts held as an economic hedge of the changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights. The fair value of our mortgage servicing rights fluctuates due to changes in prepayment speeds and other assumptions as more fully described in Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As benchmark mortgage rates increase, prepayment speeds slow and the value of our mortgage servicing rights increases. As benchmark mortgage rates fall, prepayment speeds increase and the value of our mortgage servicing rights decreases. 

-    8   - 

Changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are highly dependent on changes in primary mortgage rates, rates offered to borrowers, and assumptions about servicing revenues, servicing costs and discount rates. Changes in the fair value of residential mortgage-backed securities are highly dependent on changes in secondary mortgage rates, or rates required by investors, and interest rate derivative contracts are highly dependent on changes in other market interest rates. While primary and secondary mortgage rates generally move in the same direction, the spread between them may widen and narrow due to market conditions and government intervention. Changes in the forward-looking spread between the primary and secondary rates can cause significant earnings volatility. Additionally, the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is dependent on intermediate-term interest rates that affect the value of custodial funds. Changes in the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates can also cause significant earnings volatility.  
    
  Table   4   following shows the relationship between changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and the fair value of fair value option residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate derivative contracts held as an economic hedge. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights increased during the   third quarter of 2016   primarily due to changes in short term interest rates. The fair value of securities and interest rate derivative contracts held as an economic hedge decreased primarily due to an increase in interest rate swap rates, partially offset by a decrease in average secondary mortgage rates. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges, decreased in the   second quarter of 2016  , primarily due to a decrease in secondary mortgage and interest rate swap rates. Hedge coverage was increased during the second quarter to improve its effectiveness.

Certain percentage increases (decreases) are not meaningful for comparison purposes. 
    
  Personnel expense 
    
  Regular compensation, which consists of salaries and wages, overtime pay and temporary personnel costs,   increase  d   $4.7 million   or   6 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  . The average number of employees   increase  d   2 percent   over the prior year. Recent additions have primarily been in mortgage, wealth management and technology. In addition, standard annual merit increases in regular compensation were effective for the majority of our staff on March 1.  
    
  Incentive compensation   increase  d   $6.2 million   or   19 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Cash-based incentive compensation plans are either intended to provide current rewards to employees who generate long-term business opportunities for the Company based on growth in loans, deposits, customer relationships and other measurable metrics or intended to compensate employees with commissions on completed transactions. Total cash-based incentive compensation increased   $5.7 million   or   19 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  .  
  
   -    10   - 

Share-based compensation expense represents expense for equity awards based on grant-date fair value. Non-vested shares generally cliff vest in 3 years and are subject to a two year holding period after vesting. Compensation costs related to certain shares is variable based on changes in the the fair value of BOK Financial common shares. Share-based compensation expense   decrease  d   $1.0 million   or   36%   compared to the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in the vesting probability of certain performance-based share awards. 
    
  Employee benefits expense   increase  d   $3.2 million   or   18 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015   primarily due to a   $2.4 million     increase   in employee medical costs. Retirement plan costs and payroll taxes also increased over the prior year.  
  Personnel costs   increase  d by   $695 thousand   over the   second quarter of 2016  . Regular compensation expense   increase  d   $1.5 million  . Cash-based incentive compensation was up   $1.2 million   primarily due to revenue growth. Deferred compensation expense was up   $848 thousand   over the prior quarter. This additional expense is largely offset by the increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan assets included in Other revenue. Share-based compensation expense was   $1.9 million   lower primarily due to the decrease in the vesting probability of certain performance-based share awards. Employee benefits expense was lower compared to the prior quarter primarily due to a   $1.5 million   seasonal decrease in payroll tax expense, partially offset by a   $365 thousand     increase   in employee medical costs. 
    
  Non-personnel operating expenses 
    
  Non-personnel operating expenses   increase  d   $23.4 million   or   24 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Mortgage banking costs   increase  d   $6.9 million  . Expense related to the effect of actual loan prepayments on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights totaled   $11.4 million  , a   $4.6 million     increase   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Actual prepayments increased due to lower mortgage interest rates. Mortgage banking costs for the third quarter of 2015 included a $1.2 million benefit from the reversal of estimated claims based on a favorable resolution of an audit of servicing of certain residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.  
    
  Deposit insurance expense   increase  d   $4.5 million  , primarily due to an increase in criticized and classified assets, an input to the deposit insurance assessment, and implementation of a new surcharge for banks over $10 billion in assets. Criticized and classified assets increased compared to the prior year as a result of falling energy prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the third quarter of 2016, the deposit insurance fund reached a target of 1.15% of insured deposits which triggered a new surcharge for banks with more than $10 billion in assets to bring the deposit insurance fund to 1.35% of insured deposits. This impact was partially offset by a reduction in the base rate.  
    
  Other expense   increase  d   $4.2 million   over the prior year due primarily to a $5.0 million legal settlement accrual concerning the manner in which the Company posted charges to certain consumer and small business deposit accounts. Professional fees and services expense   increase  d   $3.9 million   primarily due to costs incurred in preparation for the mobank acquisition and increased legal fees. Data processing and communications expense   increase  d   $2.6 million   due to increased transaction activity. The Company had a net gain on sale of repossessed assets of $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $517 thousand in the third quarter of 2015. Operating expenses related to repossessed assets also declined compared to the prior year.  
  Non-personnel expense   increase  d   $6.7 million   over the   second quarter of 2016   primarily due to the $5.0 million accrual related to a legal settlement during the third quarter. Deposit insurance expense was up   $2.3 million   primarily due to the new surcharge for banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Expense related to prepayments of residential mortgage loans serviced for others   increase  d   $1.6 million   over the prior quarter, partially offset by a   $1.4 million   decrease in mortgage-related accruals. The Company had a net gain on sale of repossessed assets of $1.6 million in the third quarter compared to a net loss of $127 thousand in the second quarter. Operating expenses on repossessed assets also decreased compared to the prior quarter. The   $1.1 million   decrease in intangible asset amortization expense was due to an adjustment to a consolidated merchant-banking investment during the second quarter. 
   
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company's income tax expense from continuing operations was   $32.0 million   or   29.8%   of book taxable income for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $34.1 million   or   31.0%   of book taxable income for the   third quarter of 2015   and   $30.5 million   or   31.5%   of book taxable income for the   second quarter of 2016  .  

-    11   - 

The statute of limitations expired on uncertain income tax positions and the Company adjusted its current income tax liability amounts on filed tax returns for 2015 during the third quarter of 2016. These adjustments reduced income tax expense by $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding these adjustments, income tax expense would have been 32.3% of book taxable income for the third quarter of 2016 and 32.8% of book taxable income for the third quarter of 2015. 
  The Company's effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as amortization related to its investments in affordable housing investments net of affordable housing tax credits and other tax benefits, bank-owned life insurance and tax-exempt income. The effective tax rate is also affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate from period to period may be impacted. 
    
  BOK Financial operates in numerous jurisdictions, which requires judgment regarding the allocation of income, expense and earnings under various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction may audit our tax returns and may take different positions with respect to these allocations. The reserve for uncertain tax positions was   $14 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   and   $13 million   at   June 30, 2016  .  
   
  Lines of Business 
    
  We operate three principal lines of business: Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending, treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial customers. Commercial Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage banking activities. Wealth Management provides fiduciary services, private banking services and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities. 
    
  In addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results for Funds Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including impairment charges, the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business. 
    
  We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds, actual net credit losses and capital costs. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates.  
    
  The cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar duration. Market rates are generally based on the applicable LIBOR or interest rate swap rates, adjusted for prepayment risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk. 
    
  The value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar duration and re-pricing characteristics. Market rates are generally based on LIBOR or interest rate swap rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their re-pricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the short-term LIBOR rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to both. Shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term LIBOR rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate swap rates. The expected duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years. 
    
  Economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management s assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line, based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business.

As shown in Table   6  , net income attributable to our lines of business   increase  d   $12.4 million   or   20 percent   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Net interest revenue grew by   $19.3 million   over the prior year. Other operating revenue was up   $18.6 million  . This revenue growth was partially offset by a   $22.5 million     increase   in operating expense and a   $4.4 million     increase   in net charge-offs primarily due to energy loans.

Commercial Banking 
    
  Commercial Banking contributed   $56.0 million   to consolidated net income in the   third quarter of 2016  , an   increase   of   $8.3 million   or   18%   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Growth in net interest revenue and fees and commissions revenue was partially offset by increased loan charge-offs and higher operating expenses. Commercial Banking net loans charged off were   $5.6 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to a net recovery of   $997 thousand   in the   third quarter of 2015  . The increase was primarily related to energy portfolio loans. 
    
  Table   7   --   Commercial Banking 
  (Dollars in thousands)  

Net interest revenue   increase  d   $12.5 million   or   13%   over the prior year. Growth in net interest revenue was primarily due to a   $1.2 billion   or   10%   increase in average loan balances and increased yields on commercial loans due to rising short-term interest rates. The impact of decreased average deposit balances was offset by increased yields on deposits sold to the funds management unit related to the increase in short-term interest rates from the Federal Reserve increase in the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
    
  Fees and commissions revenue grew by   $2.6 million   or   6%   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Brokerage and trading revenue   increase  d   $1.5 million   primarily due to growth in commercial loan syndication fees and increased hedging activity by our energy customers. Transaction card revenues from our TransFund electronic funds transfer network   increase  d   $1.3 million   primarily due to increased transaction volumes. Commercial deposit service charge revenue was also up over the prior year, offset by a decrease in other revenue.

Operating expenses   increase  d   $1.4 million   or   3%   over the the   third quarter of 2015  . Personnel expense   increase  d   $1.0 million   or   4%   primarily due to standard annual merit increases and increased incentive compensation expense. Non-personnel expense   increase  d   $404 thousand   or   2%   primarily due to a   $403 thousand     increase   in intangible asset amortization. Increased business promotion expense related to timing of expenditures was offset by lower professional fees and services expense. Corporate expense allocations   decrease  d   $1.7 million   compared to the prior year. 
    
  The average outstanding balance of loans attributed to Commercial Banking grew by   $1.2 billion   or   10%   over the   third quarter of 2015   to   $13.7 billion  . See the Loans section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition following for additional discussion of changes in commercial and commercial real estate loans which are primarily attributed to the Commercial Banking segment.  
    
  Average deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were   $8.3 billion   for the   third quarter of 2016  , a   decrease   of   $310 million   or   4%   compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of change. 

Consumer Banking 
    
  Consumer Banking provides retail banking services through four primary distribution channels:  traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center, Internet banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside of our consumer banking markets and through Home Direct Mortgage, an online origination channel. During the third quarter of 2016. the Company made a strategic decision to exit the correspondent lending channel based on careful consideration of continued pressure on margin due to the competitive landscape and increasing regulatory costs.  
    
  Consumer Banking contributed   $8.8 million   to consolidated net income for the   third quarter of 2016  , up   $2.2 million   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Growth in mortgage banking revenue and net interest revenue was offset by the effect of increased actual prepayments of mortgage loans on mortgage servicing rights and increased personnel costs. Corporate expense allocations were   $2.0 million   lower than in the prior year. 
    
  Changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedge, resulted in a   $758 thousand     increase   in Consumer Banking net income in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to a   $2.7 million     decrease   in Consumer Banking net income in the   third quarter of 2015  .

Net interest revenue for the   third quarter of 2016     increase  d   $4.2 million   or   33%   over the   third quarter of 2015  , primarily due to an increase in the size of the U.S. agency mortgage-backed portfolio related to a new trading group that began operations during the third quarter of 2016 and increased rates on deposit balances sold to the Funds Management unit. Average deposit balances grew by   $423 million   or   9%   over the   third quarter of 2015  . Non-interest bearing demand deposits grew by   $173 million   or   17%   and interest-bearing transaction account balances   increase  d   $307 million   or   11%  , partially offset by a   $60 million   or   8%     decrease   in time deposit balances.

Fiduciary and asset management revenue   increase  d   $3.3 million   or   11%   over the prior year primarily due to decreased fee waivers, the Company's acquisition of Weaver and Tidwell Financial Advisors LTD d/b/a Weaver Wealth Management, a registered investment advisor, in the first quarter of 2016 and changes in market values. Brokerage and trading revenue grew by   $3.2 million   or   10%  . The addition of a new group trading in U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities and related derivatives added $1.9 million of trading revenue during the third quarter and $426 million to the trading securities portfolio at   September 30  . Growth in retail brokerage revenue was offset by lower investment banking revenue compared to the   third quarter of 2015  .  
    
  Other operating revenue includes fees earned from state and municipal bond and corporate debt underwriting and financial advisory services, primarily in the Oklahoma and Texas markets. In the   third quarter of 2016  , the Wealth Management division participated in 107 state and municipal bond underwritings that totaled $5.2 billion. As a participant, the Wealth Management division was responsible for facilitating the sale of approximately $708 million of these underwritings. The Wealth Management division also participated in 11 corporate debt underwritings that totaled $4 billion. Our interest in these underwritings was $93 million. In the   third quarter of 2015  , the Wealth Management division participated in 132 state and municipal bond underwritings that totaled approximately $3.2 billion. Our interest in these underwritings totaled approximately $997 million. The Wealth Management division also participated in three corporate debt underwritings that totaled $1.7 billion. Our interest in these underwritings was $27 million.

  Financial Condition 
   
  Securities 
    
  We maintain a securities portfolio to enhance profitability, manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements. Securities are classified as trading, held for investment, or available for sale. See Note   2   to the consolidated financial statements for the composition of the securities portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of investment (held-to-maturity) securities was   $546 million   and the fair value was   $580 million  . Investment securities consist primarily of long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds, taxable Texas school construction bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies. The investment security portfolio is diversified among issuers. The largest obligation of any single issuer is $30 million. Substantially all of these bonds are general obligations of the issuers. Approximately $104 million of the $200 million portfolio of Texas school construction bonds are also guaranteed by the Texas Permanent School Fund Guarantee Program supervised by the State Board of Education for the State of Texas. 
    
  Available for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders  equity. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled   $8.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $67 million   over   June 30, 2016  . Available for sale securities consist primarily of U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Commercial mortgage-backed securities have prepayment penalties similar to commercial loans. At   September 30, 2016  , residential mortgage-backed securities represented   65 percent   of total available for sale securities. 

-    19   - 

A primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our best estimate of the duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities at   September 30, 2016   is 2.8 years. Management estimates the duration extends to 3.3 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration contracts to 2.5 years assuming a 50 basis point decline in the current low rate environment.  
    
  Residential mortgage-backed securities also have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily investing in securities issued by U.S. government agencies. Principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $5.6 billion   of the amortized cost of the Company s residential mortgage-backed securities were issued by U.S. government agencies. The fair value of these residential mortgage-backed securities totaled   $5.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We also hold amortized cost of   $108 million   in residential mortgage-backed securities privately issued by publicly-owned financial institutions, a decrease of   $6.9 million   from   June 30, 2016  . The decrease was due to cash payments received during the quarter. The fair value of our portfolio of privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities totaled   $122 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The amortized cost of our portfolio of privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities included   $61 million   of Jumbo-A residential mortgage loans and   $47 million   of Alt-A residential mortgage loans. Jumbo-A residential mortgage loans generally meet government underwriting standards, but have loan balances that exceed agency maximums. Alt-A mortgage loans generally do not have sufficient documentation to meet government agency underwriting standards. Approximately 90 percent of our Alt-A mortgage-backed securities represent pools of fixed rate residential mortgage loans. None of the adjustable rate mortgages are payment option adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ). Approximately 29 percent of our Jumbo-A residential mortgage-backed securities represent pools of fixed rate residential mortgage loans and none of the adjustable rate mortgages are payment option ARMs. 
    
  The aggregate gross amount of unrealized losses on available for sale securities totaled   $6.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.0 million   at   June 30, 2016  . On a quarterly basis, we perform separate evaluations on debt and equity securities to determine if the unrealized losses are temporary as more fully described in Note   2   of the Consolidated Financial Statements. No other-than-temporary impairment charges were recognized in earnings during the   third quarter of 2016  .  
    
  Certain U.S. Treasury securities and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies included in fair value option securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are held as an economic hedge of changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights. We have elected to carry these securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income. These securities are held with the intent that gains or losses will offset changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related derivative contracts. 
    
  BOK Financial is required to hold stock as members of the Federal Reserve system and the Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLB"). These restricted equity securities are carried at cost as these securities do not have a readily determined fair value because the ownership of these shares is restricted and they lack a market. Federal Reserve Bank stock totaled   $36 million   and holdings of FHLB stock totaled   $297 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Holdings of FHLB stock increased   $14 million   over   June 30, 2016  . We are required to hold stock in the FHLB in proportion to our borrowings with the FHLB.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance 
    
  We have approximately   $310 million   of bank-owned life insurance at   September 30, 2016  . This investment is expected to provide a long-term source of earnings to support existing employee benefit programs. Approximately $283 million is held in separate accounts. Our separate account holdings are invested in diversified portfolios of investment-grade fixed income securities and cash equivalents, including U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt, asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The portfolios are managed by unaffiliated professional managers within parameters established in the portfolio s investment guidelines. The cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies is further supported by a stable value wrap, which protects against changes in the fair value of the investments. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of investments held in separate accounts was approximately $297 million. As the underlying fair value of the investments held in a separate account at   September 30, 2016   exceeded the net book value of the investments, no cash surrender value was supported by the stable value wrap. The stable value wrap is provided by a domestic financial institution. The remaining cash surrender value of $28 million primarily represents the cash surrender value of policies held in general accounts and other amounts due from various insurance companies. 
   
  Loans 
    
  The aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled   $16 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $58 million   over   June 30, 2016  . The outstanding balance of commercial loans   decrease  d by   $236 million   compared to   June 30, 2016  . Commercial real estate loan balances were up   $212 million  . Residential mortgage loans   decrease  d   $8.1 million   compared to   June 30, 2016   and personal loans   increase  d   $91 million   over   June 30, 2016  .

Commercial 
    
  Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers primarily located within our geographical footprint. Commercial loans are underwritten individually and represent on-going relationships based on a thorough knowledge of the customer, the customer s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer s assets including real property, inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the on-going cash flow from operations of the customer s business. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies. 
    
  Commercial loans totaled   $10.1 billion   or   61 percent   of the loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   of   $236 million   over   June 30, 2016  . Energy loan balances   decrease  d   $298 million  , manufacturing sector loans   decrease  d   $96 million   and industrial loans   decrease  d   $51 million  . Service sector loans grew by   $106 million  , wholesale/retail sector loans   increase  d by   $69 million   and healthcare sector loans   increase  d by   $34 million  .  
    
  Table   11   presents the commercial sector of our loan portfolio distributed primarily by collateral location. Loans for which collateral location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans, are distributed by the borrower's primary operating location. The majority of the collateral securing our commercial loan portfolio is located within our geographical footprint with   33 percent   concentrated in the Texas market and   23 percent   concentrated in the Oklahoma market. At   September 30, 2016  , the Other category is primarily composed of California - $295 million or 3 percent of the commercial loan portfolio, Louisiana - $175 million or 2 percent of the commercial loan portfolio, Florida - $117 million or 1% of the commercial loan portfolio, Tennessee - $106 million or 1% of the commercial loan portfolio and Ohio - $102 million or 1% of the commercial loan portfolio. All other states individually represent one percent or less of total commercial loans.

Supporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents a large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to a semi-annual engineering review by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. This review is utilized as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing conventional equipment and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of commodity prices and take proactive steps to mitigate risk when appropriate.

Outstanding energy loans totaled   $2.5 billion   or   15 percent   of total loans at   September 30, 2016  . Unfunded energy loan commitments   increase  d by   $326 million   to   $2.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . Approximately   $2.0 billion   of energy loans were to oil and gas producers,   down     $235 million   compared to   June 30, 2016  . The majority of this portfolio is first lien, senior secured, reserve-based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. The Company has largely avoided higher-risk energy lending areas including second-lien financing, mezzanine debt and subordinated debt. In addition, the Company has no direct exposure to energy company equity or to borrowers with deep-water offshore exposure. Approximately   57 percent   of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing oil and   43 percent   of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas. Loans to midstream oil and gas companies totaled   $253 million   at   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $6.8 million   over   June 30, 2016  . Loans to borrowers that provide services to the energy industry   decrease  d   $64 million   from the prior quarter to   $198 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Loans to other energy borrowers, including those engaged in wholesale or retail energy sales, totaled   $67 million  , a   $6.0 million     decrease   compared to the prior quarter.  
    
  The services sector of the loan portfolio totaled   $2.9 billion   or   18 percent   of total loans and consists of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses, including governmental, finance and insurance, not-for-profit, educational services and loans to entities providing services for real estate and construction. Service sector loans   increase  d by   $106 million   compared to   June 30, 2016  . Service sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with repayment coming from the cash flows of ongoing operations of the customer s business.  
    
  The healthcare sector of the loan portfolio consists primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Healthcare also includes loans to hospitals and other medical service providers.   
    
  We participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined by banking regulators as credits of more than $20 million and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding principal balance of these loans totaled   $3.8 billion  . Substantially all of these loans are to borrowers with local market relationships. We serve as the agent lender in approximately   17 percent   of our shared national credits, based on dollars committed. We hold shared credits to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in which we do not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management s quarterly assessment of credit risk, banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading. 
    
  Commercial Real Estate 
    
  Commercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment purposes generally within our geographical footprint, with larger concentrations in Texas and Oklahoma which represent   30 percent   and   12 percent   of the total commercial real estate portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , respectively. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with applicable lending policies. 
    
  Commercial real estate loans totaled   $3.8 billion   or   23 percent   of the loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  . The outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans   increase  d   $212 million   during the   third quarter of 2016  . Loans secured by industrial facilities   grew   by   $192 million   and loans secured by multifamily residential properties   increase  d   $87 million  . This growth was partially offset by a   $59 million     decrease   in other commercial real estate loan balances. The commercial real estate loan balance as a percentage of our total loan portfolio has ranged from   18 percent   to   23 percent   over the past five years.  
    
  The commercial real estate sector of our loan portfolio distributed by collateral location follows in Table   12  . The Other category is primarily composed of California and Utah which represent $189 million or 5% and $128 million or 3%, respectively. All other states individually represent less than 3% of the total commercial real estate portfolio.

Residential Mortgage and Personal 
    
  Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. Residential mortgage loans are secured by a first or second-mortgage on the customer s primary residence. Personal loans consist primarily of loans to wealth management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans. Residential mortgage and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability. 
    
  Residential mortgage loans totaled   $1.9 billion  , largely unchanged compared to   June 30, 2016  . In general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and adjustable-rate mortgage loans. We have no concentration in sub-prime residential mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable rate mortgage loans or adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial rates that are below market. Collateral for   97 percent   of our residential mortgage loan portfolio is located within our geographical footprint. 
    
  The majority of our permanent mortgage loan portfolio is composed of various non-conforming mortgage programs to support customer relationships including jumbo mortgage loans, non-builder construction loans and special loan programs for high net worth individuals or certain professionals. Jumbo loans may be fixed or variable rate and are fully amortizing. The size of jumbo loans exceeds maximums set under government sponsored entity standards, but otherwise generally conform to those standards. These loans generally require a minimum FICO score of 720 and a maximum debt-to-income ratio ( DTI ) of 38 percent. Loan-to-value ratios ( LTV ) are tiered from 60 percent to 100 percent, depending on the market. Special mortgage programs include fixed and variable rate fully amortizing loans tailored to the needs of certain healthcare professionals. Variable rate loans are fully indexed at origination and may have fixed rates for three to ten years, then adjust annually thereafter. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $190 million   of permanent residential mortgage loans are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. We have minimal credit exposure on loans guaranteed by the agencies. This amount includes residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met. Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Permanent residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies   decrease  d   $2.4 million   compared to   June 30, 2016  .

Home equity loans totaled   $713 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   of   $6.3 million   compared to   June 30, 2016  . Our home equity loan portfolio is primarily composed of first-lien, fully amortizing home equity loans. Home equity loans generally require a minimum FICO score of 700 and a maximum DTI of 40 percent. The maximum loan amount available for our home equity loan products is generally $400 thousand. Revolving loans have a 5 year revolving period followed by a 15 year term of amortizing repayment. Interest-only home equity loans may not be extended for any additional revolving time. All other home equity loans may be extended at management's discretion for an additional 5 year revolving term subject to an update of certain credit information. A summary of our home equity loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016   by lien position and amortizing status follows in Table   13  .

The Company secondarily evaluates loan portfolio performance based on the primary geographical market managing the loan. Loans attributed to a geographical market may not represent the location of the borrower or the collateral. All permanent mortgage loans serviced by our mortgage banking unit and held for investment by the Bank are centrally managed by the Bank of Oklahoma.

Loan Commitments 
    
  We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business. These arrangements included unfunded loan commitments which totaled   $8.7 billion   and standby letters of credit which totaled   $500 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Loan commitments may be unconditional obligations to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower s financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of credit are unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire before being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Approximately   $1.2 million   of the outstanding standby letters of credit were issued on behalf of customers whose loans are nonperforming at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Table   16       Off-Balance Sheet Credit Commitments    
  (In thousands) 

As more fully described in Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have off-balance sheet commitments related to certain residential mortgage loans originated under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse. These mortgage loans were underwritten to standards approved by the agencies, including full documentation and originated under programs available only for owner-occupied properties. The Company no longer sells residential mortgage loans with recourse. We are obligated to repurchase these loans for the life of these loans in the event of foreclosure for the unpaid principal and interest at the time of foreclosure. Substantially all of these loans are to borrowers in our primary markets including   $90 million   to borrowers in Oklahoma,   $15 million   to borrowers in Arkansas and   $12 million   to borrowers in New Mexico. 
    
  We also have an off-balance sheet obligation to repurchase residential mortgage loans sold to government sponsored entities through our mortgage banking activities due to standard representations and warranties made under contractual agreements as described further in Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the period from 2010 through the   third quarter of 2016   combined, approximately   21 percent   of repurchase requests have currently resulted in actual repurchases or indemnification by the Company. The accrual for credit losses related to potential loan repurchases under representations and warranties totaled   $3.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $3.3 million   at   June 30, 2016  . 
   
  Customer Derivative Programs 
    
  We offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural product prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties to minimize market risk due to changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us as compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit. 
    
  The customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated across a range of possible options to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be required to provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk. 
    
  Counterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each of the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee. Margin collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the counterparties  credit ratings, these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required. 

-    27   - 

A deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the fair value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or counterparty deteriorated such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supported the contract or the customer or the counterparty s ability to provide margin collateral was impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
    
  Derivative contracts are carried at fair value. At   September 30, 2016  , the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as assets under these programs totaled   $658 million   compared to   $877 million   at   June 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our derivative contracts included   $536 million   for foreign exchange contracts,   $52 million   related to to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed securities,   $49 million   for interest rate swaps and   $13 million   for energy contracts. The aggregate net fair value of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled   $654 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $872 million   at   June 30, 2016  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , total derivative assets were reduced by   $10 million   of cash collateral received from counterparties and total derivative liabilities were reduced by   $83 million   of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement. 
    
  A table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note   3   to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  The fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at   September 30, 2016   follows in Table   17  . 
    
  Table   17   --   Fair Value of Derivative Contracts    
  (In thousands) 

At   September 30, 2016  , our largest derivative exposure was to a customer for an interest rate derivative contract which totaled $6.5 million. At   September 30, 2016  , our aggregate gross exposure to internationally active domestic financial institutions was approximately $54 million comprised of $49 million of cash and securities positions and $5.5 million of gross derivative positions. We have no direct exposure to European sovereign debt and our aggregate gross exposure to European financial institutions totaled $9.3 million at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Our customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net negative fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to hold as support for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a decrease in market prices equivalent to $26.57 per barrel of oil would decrease the fair value of derivative assets by $8.8 million. An increase in prices equivalent to $74.07 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by $132 million as current prices move further away from the fixed prices embedded in our existing contracts. Liquidity requirements of this program are also affected by our credit rating. A decrease in our credit rating to below investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately   $18 million  . The fair value of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected by changes in interest rates. Based on our assessment as of   September 30, 2016  , changes in interest rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or liquidity needed to support this portion of our customer derivative program.

Summary of Loan Loss Experience 
    
  We maintain an allowance for loan losses and an accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk. At   September 30, 2016  , the combined allowance for loan losses and off-balance sheet credit losses totaled   $256 million   or   1.56 percent   of outstanding loans and   116 percent   of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The allowance for loan losses was   $245 million   and the accrual for off-balance sheet credit losses was   $11 million  . At   June 30, 2016  , the combined allowance for credit losses was   $252 million   or   1.54 percent   of outstanding loans and   111 percent   of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The allowance for loan losses was   $243 million   and the accrual for off-balance sheet credit losses was   $9.0 million  . The portion of the combined allowance for credit losses attributed to the energy portfolio totaled   3.67 percent   of outstanding energy loans at   September 30, 2016  , an increase from   3.58 percent   of outstanding energy loans at   June 30, 2016  . 
    
  The provision for credit losses is the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses and an accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk at an amount determined by management to be appropriate based on its evaluation. The provision includes the combined charge to expense for both the allowance for loan losses and the accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk. All losses incurred from lending activities will ultimately be reflected in charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses following funds advanced against outstanding commitments. After evaluating all credit factors, we recorded a   $10.0 million   provision for credit losses during the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $20.0 million   in the   second quarter of 2016   and   $7.5 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  . The lower provision for credit losses compared to previous quarter reflects continued improvement in credit metric trends over the previous quarter largely driven by energy price stability and decreased rates of newly identified nonaccruing and potential problem loans.

Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is assessed by management based on an ongoing quarterly evaluation of the probable estimated losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance consists of specific allowances attributed to certain impaired loans, general allowances based on estimated loss rates by loan class and non-specific allowances based on general economic conditions, concentration in loans with large balances and other relevant factors. 
    
  Loans are considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This includes all nonaccruing loans, all loans modified in troubled debt restructurings and all government guaranteed loans repurchased from GNMA pools. A specific allowance is required when the outstanding principal balance of the loan is not supported by either the discounted cash flows expected to be received from the borrower or the fair value of collateral for collateral dependent loans. At   September 30, 2016  , impaired loans totaled   $412 million  , including   $43 million   with specific allowances of   $6.6 million   and   $369 million   with no specific allowances. At   June 30, 2016  , impaired loans totaled   $420 million  , including   $32 million   of impaired loans with specific allowances of   $4.3 million   and   $388 million   with no specific allowances.  
  
   -    30   - 

Risk grading guidelines, recently in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") Oil and Gas Lending Handbook, heavily weight ability to repay total borrower debt, regardless of collateral position. This change in grading methodology has increased loans especially mentioned, potential problem loans and nonaccrual loans. Because substantially all of our energy portfolio is supported by senior lien positions that, in general, have substantially lower loss exposure, the historical relationship between loan classification and loss exposure may be more difficult to correlate. 
  The most recently completed energy portfolio redetermination supported that   $100 million   of impaired energy loans required no allowance for credit losses based on the adequacy of collateral. In addition, $85 million of impaired energy loans are current on all payments due.  
    
  General allowances for unimpaired loans are based on an estimated loss rate by loan class. Estimated loss rates for risk-graded loans are either increased or decreased based on changes in risk grading for each loan class. Estimated loss rates for both risk-graded and non-risk graded loans may be further adjusted for inherent risk identified for the given loan class which have not yet been captured in the loss rate. 
    
  The aggregate amount of general allowances for all unimpaired loans totaled   $210 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   of   $1.9 million   compared to   June 30, 2016  , primarily due to a   $5.9 million     decrease   in the general allowance attributed to the commercial loan segment, partially offset by a   $3.1 million     increase   in the general allowance attributed to the commercial real estate loan segment. 
    
  Nonspecific allowances are maintained for risks beyond factors specific to a particular portfolio segment or loan class. These factors include trends in the economy in our primary lending areas, concentrations in loans with large balances and other relevant factors. Nonspecific allowances totaled   $28 million   at   September 30, 2016  , up from   $27 million   at   June 30, 2016  . The nonspecific allowance includes consideration of the indirect impact that low energy prices might have on the broader economies within our geographical footprint that are highly dependent on the energy industry.  
    
  An allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment is included in Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Our loan monitoring process also identified certain accruing substandard loans that possess more than the normal amount of risk due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the collateral. Because the borrowers are still performing in accordance with the original terms of the loan agreements, and no loss of principal or interest is anticipated, these loans were not included in nonperforming assets. Known information does, however, cause management concern as to the borrowers  ability to comply with current repayment terms. These potential problem loans totaled   $478 million   at   September 30, 2016  , primarily composed of   $361 million   of energy loans,   $31 million   of service sector loans,   $27 million   of wholesale/retail sector loans,   $20 million   of manufacturing sector loans,   $19 million   of healthcare sector loans and   $10 million   of other commercial and industrial loans. Potential problem loans totaled   $501 million   at   June 30, 2016   including   $421 million   of potential problem energy loans.  
    
  Based on regulatory guidelines, other loans especially mentioned are in compliance with the original terms of the agreement but may have a weakness that deserves management's close attention. Energy loans classified as other loans especially mentioned totaled   $147 million   or   6 percent   of outstanding energy loans at   September 30, 2016   and   $198 million   or   7 percent   of outstanding energy loans at   June 30, 2016  .  
    
  We updated our energy loan portfolio stress test at quarter end to estimate how the energy portfolio may respond in a prolonged low-price environment. Stress test assumptions include a starting price of $2.00 per million BTUs for natural gas and $37.50 per barrel of oil, gradually escalating over seven years to a maximum of $3.00 and $55.00, respectively. In this scenario, the energy portfolio exhibits greater stress than we have experienced to date and losses would be expected to exceed our 15 year historical loss rate on energy loans of 7 basis points. The results of the stress test are factored into our expectation that the loan loss provision could range from $70 million to $85 million for 2016. This expectation is based upon current observed conditions.

Net Loans Charged Off 
    
  Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when the loan balance or a portion of the loan balance is no longer covered by the paying capacity of the borrower based on an evaluation of available cash resources and collateral value. Internally risk graded loans are evaluated quarterly and charge-offs are taken in the quarter in which the loss is identified. Non-risk graded loans are generally charged off when payments are between 60 days and 180 days past due, depending on loan class. In addition, non-risk graded loans are generally charged-down to collateral value within 60 days of being notified of a borrower's bankruptcy filing, regardless of payment status. 
    
  BOK Financial had net loans charged off of   $6.1 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $7.5 million   in the   second quarter of 2016   and   $1.8 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  . The ratio of net loans charged off to average loans on an annualized basis was   0.15 percent   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared with   0.18 percent   for the   second quarter of 2016   and   0.05 percent   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  
    
  Net commercial loans charged off totaled   $6.1 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to net loans charged off of   $7.1 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  . Charge-offs in both the third and second quarter of 2016 resulted primarily from energy loans. Net commercial real estate loan recoveries were   $521 thousand   in the   third   quarter, compared to net recoveries of   $282 thousand   in the   second   quarter. Residential mortgage net recoveries were   $365 thousand   and personal loan net charge-offs were   $860 thousand   for the   third   quarter. Personal loan net charge-offs include deposit account overdraft losses.

  Nonperforming assets totaled   $349 million   or   2.12 percent   of outstanding loans and repossessed assets at   September 30, 2016  . Nonaccruing loans totaled   $237 million  , accruing renegotiated residential mortgage loans totaled   $80 million   and real estate and other repossessed assets totaled   $32 million  . All accruing renegotiated residential mortgage loans and   $15 million   of nonaccruing loans are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Excluding assets guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, nonperforming assets   increase  d   $2.0 million   during the   third   quarter. The Company generally retains nonperforming assets to maximize potential recovery which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly. 

-    34   - 

Loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we will not collect the full contractual principal and interest. As more fully discussed in Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we may modify loans in troubled debt restructurings. Modifications may include extension of payment terms and rate concessions. We generally do not forgive principal or accrued but unpaid interest. All loans modified in troubled debt restructurings, except for residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, are classified as nonaccruing. We may also renew matured nonaccruing loans. All nonaccruing loans, including those renewed or modified in troubled debt restructurings, are charged off when the loan balance is no longer covered by the paying capacity of the borrower based on a quarterly evaluation of available cash resources and collateral value. All nonaccruing loans generally remain on nonaccrual status until full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the original terms, including principal previously charged off, is probable. We generally do not voluntarily modify personal loans to troubled borrowers. Personal loans modified at the direction of bankruptcy court orders are identified as troubled debt restructurings and classified as nonaccruing. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , renegotiated loans consist solely of accruing residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of troubled debt restructurings. Generally, we modify residential mortgage loans primarily by reducing interest rates and extending the number of payments in accordance with U.S. government agency guidelines. Generally, no unpaid principal or interest is forgiven. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan. Modified loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies under residential mortgage loan programs may be sold once they become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines. 
    
  A rollforward of nonperforming assets for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   follows in Table   20  .

We foreclose on loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies in accordance with agency guidelines. Generally these loans are not eligible for modification programs or have failed to comply with modified loan terms. Principal is guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government, subject to limitations and credit risk is minimal. These properties will be conveyed to the agencies once applicable criteria have been met.  
  Commercial 
    
  Nonaccruing commercial loans totaled   $176 million   or   1.74 percent   of total commercial loans at   September 30, 2016   and   $182 million   or   1.76 percent   of commercial loans at   June 30, 2016  . There were   $22 million   in newly identified nonaccruing commercial loans during the quarter, offset by   $7 million   in payments and   $6.3 million   of charge-offs. Newly identified nonaccruing commercial loans were primarily other commercial and industrial loans and energy loans. 
    
  Nonaccruing commercial loans at   September 30, 2016   were primarily composed of   $143 million   or   5.67 percent   of total energy loans, and   $21 million   or   4.50 percent   of total other commercial and industrial sector loans. 
  Commercial Real Estate 
    
  Nonaccruing commercial real estate loans totaled   $7.4 million   or   0.19 percent   of outstanding commercial real estate loans at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $7.8 million   or   0.22 percent   of outstanding commercial real estate loans at   June 30, 2016  . Newly identified nonaccruing commercial real estate loans of   $1.0 million   were offset by   $1.5 million   of cash payments received. There were   no   charge-offs or foreclosures of nonaccruing commercial real estate loans during the   third   quarter. 
    
  Nonaccruing commercial real estate loans were primarily composed of   $3.7 million   or   2.34 percent   of residential construction and land development loans. 
    
  Residential Mortgage and Personal  
    
  Nonaccruing residential mortgage loans totaled   $52 million   or   2.80 percent   of outstanding residential mortgage loans at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $57 million   or   3.03 percent   of outstanding residential mortgage loans at   June 30, 2016  . Newly identified nonaccruing residential mortgage loans totaling   $4.0 million   were offset by   $6.3 million   of foreclosures,   $2.6 million   of payments and   $285 thousand   of loans charged off during the quarter.  
    
  Nonaccruing residential mortgage loans primarily consist of non-guaranteed permanent residential mortgage loans which totaled   $26 million   or   2.68 percent   of outstanding non-guaranteed permanent residential mortgage loans at   September 30, 2016  . Nonaccruing home equity loans totaled   $11 million   or   1.55 percent   of total home equity loans.

Liquidity and Capital 
    
  Subsidiary Bank 
    
  Deposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for BOKF, NA, the wholly owned subsidiary bank of BOK Financial. Based on the average balances for the   third quarter of 2016  , approximately   64 percent   of our funding was provided by deposit accounts,   21 percent   from borrowed funds, and   10 percent   from equity. Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks and other banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs. 
    
  Deposit accounts represent our largest funding source. We compete for retail and commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through our Perfect Banking sales and customer service program, free checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and a 24-hour Express Bank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits when the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources. 
    
  Table   23   -   Average Deposits by Line of Business

Average deposits for the   third quarter of 2016   totaled   $20.8 billion   and represented approximately   64 percent   of total liabilities and capital, up from   $20.5 billion   and   64 percent   of total liabilities and capital for the   second quarter of 2016  . Average deposits   increase  d   $297 million   from the   second quarter of 2016  . Average demand deposits   increase  d by   $335 million   and average interest-bearing transaction accounts   increase  d by   $60 million  , partially offset by a   $100 million     decrease   in average time deposit balances.  
    
  Average Commercial Banking deposit balances   decrease  d   $86 million   compared to the   second quarter of 2016  , primarily due to a   $102 million     decrease   in energy customer balances and a   $62 million     decrease   in other commercial and industrial balances, partially offset by a   $45 million     increase   in small business customer balances and a   $21 million     increase   in commercial real estate customer balances. Commercial customers continue to retain large cash reserves primarily due to low yields available on other high quality investment alternatives and to minimize deposit service charges through the earnings credit. The earnings credit is a non-cash method that enables commercial customers to offset deposit service charges based on account balances. If economic activity were to improve significantly or if short-term interest rates were to increase, deposits may decline as customers deploy funds into projects or shift demand deposits into money market instruments. 
    
  Average Consumer Banking deposit balances   increase  d   $26 million  . Demand deposit balances   increase  d by   $66 million   and interest-bearing transaction deposits   increase  d by   $1.4 million  , partially offset by a   $38 million     decrease   in time deposit balances. Growth in Consumer Banking deposits includes escrow funds associated with mortgage loan servicing. These deposits tend to grow throughout the year and are largely disbursed near year end.  
    
  Average Wealth Management deposits   increase  d   $392 million   compared to the   second quarter of 2016   primarily due to a   $346 million     increase   in interest-bearing transaction account balances and an   $84 million     increase   in demand deposits, partially offset by a   $39 million     decrease   in time deposit balances. Growth in Wealth Management deposits include funds being held temporarily in anticipation of money market reforms.

Average interest-bearing transaction accounts for the   third   quarter included $678 million of brokered deposits, an increase of $115 million over the   second quarter of 2016  . Changes in average brokered deposits largely affect Funds Management and Other.

In addition to deposits, liquidity is provided primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased from bankers  banks and Federal Home Loan banks from across the country. The largest single source of wholesale federal funds purchased totaled $44 million at   September 30, 2016  . Securities repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain available for sale securities. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings are generally short term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka averaged   $6.3 billion   during the quarter, compared to   $6.0 billion   in the   second quarter of 2016  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated unused credit available to BOKF, NA from collateralized sources was approximately $4.3 billion. 
    
  A summary of other borrowings for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis follows in Table   25  .

In 2007, BOKF, NA issued $250 million of subordinated debt due May 15, 2017 to fund the Worth National Bank and First United Bank acquisitions and fund continued asset growth. Interest on this debt was based on a fixed rate of 5.75 percent through May 14, 2012 which then converted to a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.69 percent. The $227 million of this subordinated debt that remained outstanding was called during the third quarter of 2016. 
  BOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors.  
  Parent Company 
    
  On June 27, 2016, the parent company completed the issuance and sale of $150 million of subordinated debt that will mature on June 30, 2056. Interest on this debt bears interest at the rate of 5.375%, payable quarterly. On June 30, 2021, the parent company will have the option to redeem the debt at the principal amount plus accrued interest, subject to regulatory approval. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , cash and interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents held by the parent company totaled $336 million. The primary sources of liquidity for BOK Financial are cash on hand and dividends from BOKF, NA. Dividends from the bank are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as defined, for the year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At   September 30, 2016  , based upon the most restrictive limitations as well as management's internal capital policy, the bank could declare up to $172 million of dividends without regulatory approval. Dividend constraints may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or increases in required regulatory capital at the bank could affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company. 
    
  Our equity capital at   September 30, 2016   was   $3.4 billion  , an   increase   of   $30 million   over   June 30, 2016  . Net income less cash dividends paid   increase  d equity   $46 million   during the   third quarter of 2016  . Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased   $22 million   primarily related to the change in unrealized gains on available for sale securities due to changes in interest rates. Capital is managed to maximize long-term value to the shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings, asset growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends. 
    
  On October 27, 2015, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million common shares, subject to market conditions, securities law and other regulatory compliance limitations. As of   September 30, 2016  , a cumulative total of 2,179,243 shares have been repurchased under this authorization. No shares were repurchased in the   third quarter of 2016  .

BOK Financial and BOKF, NA are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations. These capital requirements include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators. 
  Effective January 1, 2015 for BOK Financial, regulatory capital rules establish a 7 percent threshold for the common equity Tier 1 ratio consisting of a minimum level plus capital conservation buffer. The Company has elected to exclude unrealized gains and losses from available for sale securities from its calculation of Tier 1 capital, consistent with the treatment under previous capital rules.  
    
  A summary of minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer follows in Table   26  . A bank which falls below these levels, including the capital conservation buffer, would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions (including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases) and executive bonus payments. 
    
  The capital ratios for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis are presented in Table   26  . 
    
  Table   26   --   Capital Ratios    

Capital resources of financial institutions are also regularly measured by the tangible common shareholders  equity ratio. Tangible common shareholders  equity is shareholders  equity as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) less intangible assets and equity which does not benefit common shareholders. Equity that does not benefit common shareholders includes preferred equity. This non-GAAP measure is a valuable indicator of a financial institution s capital strength since it eliminates intangible assets from shareholders  equity and retains the effect of unrealized losses on securities and other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders  equity. 
    
  Table   27   provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.

On October 20, 2016, BOK Financial published the results of its annual capital stress test. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve must publish regulations that require bank holding companies with $10 billion to $50 billion in assets to perform annual capital stress tests. The Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test ("DFAST") is a forward-looking exercise under which the Company and its banking subsidiary estimate the impact of a hypothetical severely adverse macroeconomic scenario provided by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on its financial condition and regulatory capital ratios over a nine-quarter time horizon. Under the scenario provided by the regulatory agencies, all capital ratio measures remain above minimum regulatory thresholds. Additional information concerning the annual stress test may be found on the Company's Investor Relations page at www.bokf.com under the "Presentations" tab. The results of subsequent capital stress tests may alter the Company's future capital management plans.

  Market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes may be the result of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices. Financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading. Market risk excludes changes in fair value due to the credit of the individual issuers of financial instruments. 
    
  BOK Financial is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on both its assets held for purposes other than trading and trading assets. The effects of other changes, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices do not pose significant market risk to BOK Financial. BOK Financial has no material investments in assets that are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates or equity prices. Energy and agricultural product derivative contracts, which are affected by changes in commodity prices, are matched against offsetting contracts as previously discussed. 
    
  The Asset/Liability Committee is responsible for managing market risk in accordance with policy guidelines established by the Board of Directors. The Committee monitors projected variation in net interest revenue, net income and economic value of equity due to specified changes in interest rates. The internal policy limit for net interest revenue variation is a maximum decline of 5 percent to an up or down 200 basis point change over twelve months. These guidelines also set maximum levels for short-term borrowings, short-term assets, public funds and brokered deposits and establish minimum levels for unpledged assets, among other things. Compliance with these internal guidelines is reviewed monthly. The Asset/Liabilty Committee is also responsible for monitoring market risk limits for mortgage banking production and mortgage servicing assets inclusive of economic hedge benefits. Each of these desks must limit projected exposure from a 50 basis point change in interest rates. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk   Other than Trading 
    
  As previously noted in the Net Interest Revenue section of this report, management has implemented strategies to manage the Company s balance sheet to have relatively limited exposure to changes in interest rates over a twelve-month period. The effectiveness of these strategies in managing the overall interest rate risk is evaluated through the use of an asset/liability model. BOK Financial performs a sensitivity analysis to identify more dynamic interest rate risk exposures, including embedded option positions on net interest revenue, net income and economic value of equity. A simulation model is used to estimate the effect of changes in interest rates on the Company's performance across multiple interest rate scenarios. While the current internal policy limit for net interest revenue variation is a maximum decline of 5 percent due to a 200 basis point change over twelve months, the results of a 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low-rate environment are not meaningful. We report the effect of a 50 basis point decrease in the interim.

The Company s primary interest rate exposures include the Federal Funds rate, which affects short-term borrowings, and the prime lending rate and LIBOR, which are the basis for much of the variable rate loan pricing. Additionally, residential mortgage rates directly affect the prepayment speeds for residential mortgage-backed securities and mortgage servicing rights. Derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments used for purposes other than trading are included in this simulation. In addition, the impact on the level and composition of DDA and other core deposit balances resulting from a significant increase in short-term market interest rates and the overall interest rate environment is likely to be material. The simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the effects of such changes based on a combination of historical analysis and expected behavior. The impact of planned growth and new business activities is factored into the simulation model. The effects of changes in interest rates on the value of mortgage servicing rights are excluded from Table   28   due to the extreme volatility over such a large rate range and our active risk management approach for that asset. The effects of interest rate changes on the value of mortgage servicing rights are presented in Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  The simulations used to manage market risk are based on numerous assumptions regarding the effects of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of re-pricing characteristics, future cash flows and customer behavior. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue, net income or economic value of equity or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest revenue, net income or economic value of equity. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors.

Trading Activities 
    
  BOK Financial enters into trading activities both as an intermediary for customers and for its own account. As an intermediary, BOK Financial will take positions in securities, generally residential mortgage-backed securities, government agency securities and municipal bonds. These securities are purchased for resale to customers, which include individuals, corporations, foundations and financial institutions. On a limited basis, BOK Financial may also take trading positions in U.S. Treasury securities, residential mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds to enhance returns on its securities portfolios. Both of these activities involve interest rate risk. BOK Financial has an insignificant exposure to foreign exchange risk and does not take positions in commodity derivatives. 
    
  A variety of methods are used to manage the interest rate risk of trading activities. These methods include daily marking of all positions to market value, independent verification of inventory pricing, and position limits for each trading activity. Economic hedges in either the futures, over the counter derivatives or cash markets may be used to reduce the risk associated with some trading programs. 
    
  Management uses a Value at Risk ("VaR") methodology to measure market risk due to changes in interest rates inherent in its trading activities. VaR is calculated based upon historical simulations over the past five years using a variance/covariance matrix of interest rate changes, a 10 business day holding period and a 99 percent confidence interval. It represents an amount of market loss that is likely to be exceeded in only one out of every 100 two-week periods. Trading positions are managed within guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. These guidelines limit the VaR to $7.3 million. There were no instances of VaR being exceeded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , there were no trading positions for the purposes of enhancing returns on the Company's securities portfolio.  
    
  The average, high and low VaR amounts for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   are as follows in Table   29  . 

-    44   - 

Table   29   --   Trading Value at Risk (VaR)    
  (In thousands) 

The Company expanded its trading activities during the third quarter through the initial operation of a team that deals in specified pools of mortgage loans that have been placed into U.S. government agency issued securities and related derivative instruments. These instruments are generally customized to meet requirements of specific customers. This team also serves as a market maker that provides liquidity as both a buyer and seller of to-be-announced derivative instruments. Each of these expanded activities must fall within the VaR guidelines mentioned above.  
    
  The Company also bears interest rate risk by originating residential mortgages held for sale (RMHFS). A variety of methods are used to manage the interest rate risk of mortgage origination activities. These methods include daily marking of all positions to market value, independent verification of inventory pricing, and revenue sensitivity limits. Interest rate risk from RMHFS is mitigated through forward sale contracts.   
    
  Management uses a pre-tax income sensitivity methodology to measure market risk from RMHFS. Pre-tax income sensitivity is calculated using a + / - 50 basis point change in interest rates, a 30 day average fall out rate, and a projected fall out-rate that is statistically modeled and recalibrated using such factors as loan product type, seasonality, region, originator, channel, rate lock terms, rate change scenario and various borrower characteristics. The Company monitors the effectiveness of this model through back-testing, updating the data and regular validations. Trading positions are managed within guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. These guidelines limit the pre-tax income sensitivity to $7 million. There were no instances of pre-tax income sensitivity exceeding the $7 million limit during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  The average, high and low pre-tax income sensitivity amounts for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   are as follows.

Controls and Procedures 
    
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b), BOK Financial s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by their report, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. As required by Rule 13a-15(d), BOK Financial s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during the quarter covered by this report.

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This report contains forward-looking statements that are based on management s beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates, and projections about BOK Financial, the financial services industry and the economy in general. Words such as  anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   expects,   forecasts,   plans,   projects,   will,   intends,  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Management judgments relating to and discussion of the provision and allowance for credit losses, allowance for uncertain tax positions, accruals for loss contingencies and valuation of mortgage servicing rights involve judgments as to expected events and are inherently forward-looking statements. Assessments that BOK Financial s acquisitions and other growth endeavors will be profitable are necessary statements of belief as to the outcome of future events, based in part on information provided by others that BOK Financial has not independently verified. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what is expressed, implied, or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Internal and external factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and interest rate relationships, demand for products and services, the degree of competition by traditional and nontraditional competitors, changes in banking regulations, tax laws, prices, levies and assessments, the impact of technological advances, and trends in customer behavior as well as their ability to repay loans. BOK Financial and its affiliates undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

  Newly Adopted and Pending Accounting Policies 
    
  Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09") 
    
  On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by providing a more robust framework that will give greater consistency and comparability in revenue recognition practices. In the new framework, an entity recognizes revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services. The new model requires the identification of performance obligations included in contracts with customers, a determination of the transaction price and an allocation of the price to those performance obligations. The entity recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) ("ASU 2016-08") 
    
  On March 17, 2016, the FASB Issued ASU 2016-08 to amend the principal versus agent implementation guidance in ASU 2014-09. The ASU clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. ASU 2016-08 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-08 will have on the Company's financial statements along with ASU 2014-09.  

-    53   - 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ("ASU 2016-10") 
    
  On April 14, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 which amends certain sections of ASU 2014-09 related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation. ASU 2016-10 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-10 will have on the Company's financial statements along with ASU 2014-09. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ("ASU 2016-12") 
    
  On May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, which amends certain aspects of the Board's new revenue standard, ASU 2014-09. The amendments clarify information regarding collectibility, presentation of sales tax and other similar taxes collected from customers, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition, and transition disclosures. ASU 2016-12 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-12 will have on the Company's financial statements along with ASU 2014-09. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-16,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or to Equity   ("ASU 2014-16") 
    
  On November 3, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16 to eliminate the use of different methods and reduce diversity under GAAP in the accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share. For hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share, an entity should determine the nature of the host contract by considering all stated and implied substantive terms and features of the hybrid financial instrument. The entity should determine the nature of the host contract by considering the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument, including the embedded derivative feature that is being evaluated for separate accounting from the host contract. For public business entities, the ASU was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. Adoption of ASU 2014-16 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ("ASU 2015-02") 
    
  On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 to address concerns that current U.S. GAAP may require a reporting entity to consolidate another legal entity where the reporting entity's contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entity's voting rights, or the reporting entity is not exposed to a majority of the legal entity's economic benefits or obligations. The amendments affect limited partnerships and similar legal entities, the evaluation of fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest, the effect of fee arrangements and related parties on the primary beneficiary determination, and certain investment funds. The ASU was effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015 for public companies. Adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-07,   Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) ("ASU 2015-07") 
    
  On May 1, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07 to gain consistency within the categorization of the fair value hierarchy. The update removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. It also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The ASU was effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Adoption of ASU 2015-07 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10):  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ("ASU 2016-01") 
    
  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 over the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The update requires equity investments, in general, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. It also eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost, requires entities to use the exit price notion when measuring fair value, requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the fair value option has been elected, requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form on the balance sheet or accompanying notes, clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets, and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Upon adoption, unrealized gains and losses from equity securities will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to retained earnings. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $3.3 million   of unrealized gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02") 
    
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The final guidance requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets and may affect the presentation and timing of expense recognition, eliminates the current real estate-specific provisions, modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases for lessors. The ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the amendments is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships ("ASU 2016-05") 
    
  On March 10, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05 which clarifies that "a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument in an existing hedging relationship would not, in and of itself, be considered a termination of the derivative instrument" or "a change in a critical term of the hedging relationship." If all other hedge accounting criteria in ASC 815 are met, a hedging relationship where the hedging derivative instrument is novated would not be discontinued or need to be redesignated. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity would apply the guidance prospectively unless modified retrospective transition is elected. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of ASU 2016-05 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-07,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures ("ASU 2016-07") 
    
  On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07 to simplify the equity method of accounting by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The ASU also requires that unrealized holding gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income related to an available for sale security that becomes eligible for the equity method be recognized in earnings as of the date the investment qualifies for the equity method. The ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09") 
    
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 to simplify multiple aspects of accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including accounting income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Implementation of ASU 2016-09 will add volatility to tax expense as stock prices change; however, we expect the impact to be insignificant. 

-    55   - 

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost ("ASU 2016-13") 
    
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 in order to provide more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments. The ASU adds an impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss ("CECL") model) that is based on expected credit losses rather than incurred credit losses. It requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-13 will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ("ASU 2016-15") 
    
  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which amends guidance in ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, in order to reduce inconsistent application. The amendments address eight cash flow issues including debt repayment and extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments following a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable. Adoption of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

  On a quarterly basis, the Company performs separate evaluations of impaired debt and equity investments and available for sale securities to determine if the unrealized losses are temporary. 
    
  For debt securities, management determines whether it intends to sell or if it is more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell impaired securities. This determination considers current and forecasted liquidity requirements, regulatory and capital requirements and securities portfolio management. Based on this evaluation as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not intend to sell any impaired available for sale securities before fair value recovers to the current amortized cost and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell impaired securities before fair value recovers, which may be maturity.

  At   September 30, 2016  , the entire portfolio of privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities was rated below investment grade by the nationally-recognized rating agencies. The gross unrealized loss on these securities totaled   $230 thousand  . Impairment of securities rated below investment grade was evaluated based on projections of estimated cash flows from individual loans underlying each security using current and anticipated unemployment and default rates, changes in housing prices and estimated liquidation costs at foreclosure. Each factor is considered in the evaluation.

  Credit loss impairment is recorded as a charge to earnings. Additional impairment based on the difference between the total unrealized loss and the estimated credit loss on these securities is charged against other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes.   No   credit loss impairments were recognized in earnings on privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  A distribution of the amortized cost (after recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment), fair value and credit loss impairments recognized on our privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities is as follows (in thousands, except for number of securities): 

Impaired equity securities, including perpetual preferred stocks, are evaluated based on management's ability and intent to hold the securities until fair value recovers over periods not to exceed three years. The assessment of the ability and intent to hold these securities focuses on the liquidity needs, asset/liability management objectives and securities portfolio objectives. Factors considered when assessing recovery include forecasts of general economic conditions and specific performance of the issuer, analyst ratings and credit spreads for preferred stocks which have debt-like characteristics. The Company has evaluated the near-term prospects of the investments in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment and based on that evaluation has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery in fair value. Accordingly, all impairment of equity securities was considered temporary at   September 30, 2016  .

  Fair Value Option Securities 
    
  Fair value option securities represent securities which the Company has elected to carry at fair value and are separately identified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur. Certain U.S. Treasury securities, residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and derivative contracts are held as an economic hedge of the mortgage servicing rights.  
    
  The fair value and net unrealized gain (loss) included in fair value option securities is as follows (in thousands): 

Restricted Equity Securities 
    
  Restricted equity securities primarily include stock we are required to hold as members of the Federal Reserve system and the Federal Home Loan Banks. Restricted equity securities are carried at cost as these securities do not have a readily determined fair value because ownership of these shares are restricted and lacks a market. A summary of restricted equity securities follows (in thousands):

(  3  )   Derivatives    
    
  Derivative instruments may be used by the Company as part of its internal risk management programs or may be offered to customers. All derivative instruments are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are reported in earnings as they occur. Credit risk is also considered in determining fair value.  
    
  When bilateral netting agreements or similar arrangements exist between the Company and its counterparties that create a single legal claim or obligation to pay or receive the net amount in settlement of the individual derivative contracts, the Company reports derivative assets and liabilities on a net by derivative contract type by counterparty basis.  
    
  Derivative contracts may require the Company to provide or receive cash margin as collateral for derivative assets and liabilities. Derivative assets and liabilities are reported net of cash margin when certain conditions are met. In addition, derivative contracts executed with customers under Customer Risk Management Programs may be secured by non-cash collateral in conjunction with a credit agreement with that customer. Access to collateral, in the event of default is reasonably assured. As of   September 30, 2016  , a decrease in BOK Financial's credit rating to below investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately   $18 million  . 
    
  None of these derivative contracts have been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. 
    
  Customer Risk Management Programs 
    
  BOK Financial offers programs to permit its customers to manage various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural products, and foreign exchange rates, or to take positions in derivative contracts. Customers may also manage interest rate risk through interest rate swaps used by borrowers to modify interest rate terms of their loans or to-be-announced securities used by mortgage banking customers to hedge their loan production. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and BOK Financial. Offsetting contracts are executed between BOK Financial and other selected counterparties to minimize the risk of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or fee paid to BOK Financial as profit and compensation for administrative costs and credit risk which is recognized over the life of the contracts and included in other operating revenue   brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
    
  Internal Risk Management Programs 
    
  BOK Financial may use derivative contracts in managing its interest rate sensitivity, as part of its economic hedge of the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and as an economic hedge of trading securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , derivative contracts under the internal risk management programs were primarily used as part of the economic hedges of the change in the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights and trading securities. 
    
  As discussed in Note   6  , certain derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to mortgage loan commitments and forward sales contracts are included in Residential mortgage loans held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note   6   for additional discussion of notional, fair value and impact on earnings of these contracts.

(  4  )   Loans and Allowances for Credit Losses    
    
  Loans 
    
  Loans are either secured or unsecured based on the type of loan and the financial condition of the borrower. Repayment is generally expected from cash flow or proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrower. BOK Financial is exposed to risk of loss on loans due to the borrower s difficulties, which may arise from any number of factors, including problems within the respective industry or local economic conditions. Access to collateral, in the event of borrower default, is reasonably assured through adherence to applicable lending laws and through sound lending standards and credit review procedures. Accounting policies for all loans, excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, are as follows. 
    
  Interest is accrued at the applicable interest rate on the principal amount outstanding. Loans are placed on nonaccruing status when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal or interest is uncertain. Internally risk graded loans are individually evaluated for nonaccruing status quarterly. Non-risk graded loans are generally placed on nonaccruing status when more than   90 days   past due or within   60 days   of being notified of the borrower's bankruptcy filing. Interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against interest income when the loan is placed on nonaccruing status. Payments on nonaccruing loans are applied to principal or recognized as interest income, according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal. Loans may be returned to accruing status when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal and interest, including principal previously charged off, is probable based on improvements in the borrower s financial condition or a sustained period of performance. 
    
  Loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties may be modified in troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"). All TDRs are classified as nonaccruing, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Modifications generally consist of extension of payment terms or interest rate concessions and may result either voluntarily through negotiations with the borrower or involuntarily through court order. Generally, principal and accrued but unpaid interest is not voluntarily forgiven.  
    
  Performing loans may be renewed under the current collateral value, debt service ratio and other underwriting standards. Nonaccruing loans may be renewed and will remain classified as nonaccruing.  
    
  All loans are charged off when the loan balance or a portion of the loan balance is no longer supported by the paying capacity of the borrower or when the required cash flow is reduced in a TDR. The charge-off amount is determined through a quarterly evaluation of available cash resources and collateral value and charge-offs are taken in the quarter in which the loss is identified. Non-risk graded loans that are past due between   60   and   180 days  , based on the loan product type, are charged off. Loans to borrowers whose personal obligation has been discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings are charged off within   60 days   of notice of the bankruptcy filing, regardless of payment status. 
    
  Loan origination and commitment fees and direct loan acquisition and origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to yield over the life of the loan or over the commitment period, as applicable. 
    
  Qualifying residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have been sold into GNMA pools. Under certain performance conditions specified in government programs, the Company may have the right, but not the obligation to repurchase loans from GNMA pools. These loans no longer qualify for sale accounting and are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Guaranteed loans are considered impaired because we do not expect to receive all principal and interest based on the loan's contractual terms. The principal balance continues to be guaranteed; however, interest accrues at a curtailed rate as specified in the programs. The carrying value of these loans is reduced based on an estimate of the expected cash flows discounted at the original note rate plus a liquidity spread. Guaranteed loans may be modified in TDRs in accordance with U.S. government agency guidelines. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified rate. Guaranteed loans may either be resold into GNMA pools after a performance period specified by the programs or foreclosed and conveyed to the guarantors.  
    
  Loans are disaggregated into portfolio segments and further disaggregated into classes. The portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses. Classes are a further disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the risk characteristics of the loans and the Company s method for monitoring and assessing credit risk.

Portfolio segments of the loan portfolio are as follows (in thousands): 

1   
    Excludes residential mortgage loans guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government 
       
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $5.3 billion   or   32 percent   of our total loan portfolio is to businesses and individuals attributed to the Texas market and   $3.7 billion   or   22 percent   of the total loan portfolio is to businesses and individuals attributed to the Oklahoma market. These geographic concentrations subject the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within these areas. 
    
  Commercial 
    
  Commercial loans represent loans for working capital, facilities acquisition or expansion, purchases of equipment and other needs of commercial customers primarily located within our geographical footprint. Commercial loans are underwritten individually and represent on-going relationships based on a thorough knowledge of the customer, the customer s industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer s assets including real property, inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, interest in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the on-going cash flow from operations of the customer s business. Inherent lending risk is centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , commercial loans attributed to the Texas market totaled   $3.3 billion   or   33 percent   of the commercial loan portfolio segment and commercial loans attributed to the Oklahoma market totaled   $2.3 billion   or   23 percent   of the commercial loan portfolio segment.  
    
  The commercial loan portfolio segment is further divided into loan classes. The energy loan class totaled   $2.5 billion   or   15 percent   of total loans at   September 30, 2016  , including   $2.0 billion   of outstanding loans to energy producers. Approximately   57 percent   of committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing oil and   43 percent   are secured by properties producing natural gas. The services loan class totaled   $2.9 billion   or   18 percent   of total loans at   September 30, 2016  . Approximately   $1.3 billion   of loans in the services category consist of loans with individual balances of less than   $10 million  . Businesses included in the services class include governmental, finance and insurance, not-for-profit, educational services and loans to entities providing services for real estate and construction. The healthcare loan class totaled   $2.1 billion   or   13 percent   of total loans at   September 30, 2016  . The healthcare loan class consists primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living, assisted living and skill nursing. Healthcare also includes loans to hospitals and other medical service providers. 

-    75   - 

Commercial Real Estate 
    
  Commercial real estate loans are for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment purposes primarily within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with applicable lending policies. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   30 percent   of commercial real estate loans are secured by properties primarily located in the Dallas and Houston areas of Texas. An additional   12 percent   of commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located primarily in the Tulsa and Oklahoma City metropolitan areas of Oklahoma.  
    
  Residential Mortgage and Personal 
    
  Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. Residential mortgage loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer s primary residence. Personal loans consist primarily of loans secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans. Residential mortgage and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability. Residential mortgage loans retained in the Company s portfolio are primarily composed of various mortgage programs to support customer relationships including jumbo mortgage loans, non-builder construction loans and special loan programs for high net worth individuals and certain professionals. Jumbo loans may be fixed or variable rate and are fully amortizing. Jumbo loans generally conform to government sponsored entity standards, except that the loan size exceeds maximums required under these standards. These loans generally require a minimum FICO score of   720   and a maximum debt-to-income ratio ( DTI ) of   38 percent  .  Loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios are tiered from   60 percent   to   100 percent  , depending on the market. Special mortgage programs include fixed and variable fully amortizing loans tailored to the needs of certain healthcare professionals. Variable rate loans are fully indexed at origination and may have fixed rates for   three   to   ten years  , then adjust annually thereafter.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , residential mortgage loans included   $190 million   of loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools. These loans either have been repurchased or are eligible to be repurchased by the Company when certain defined delinquency criteria are met. Although payments on these loans generally are past due more than 90 days, interest continues to accrue based on the government guarantee. 
    
  Home equity loans totaled   $713 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Approximately,   66 percent   of the home equity loan portfolio is comprised of first lien loans and   34 percent   of the home equity portfolio is comprised of junior lien loans. Junior lien loans are distributed   58 percent   to amortizing term loans and   42 percent   to revolving lines of credit.   Home equity loans generally require a minimum FICO score of 700 and a maximum DTI of 40 percent.   The maximum loan amount available for our home equity loan products is generally   $400 thousand  . Revolving loans have a   5   year revolving period followed by a   15   year term of amortizing repayments. Interest-only home equity loans may not be extended for any additional revolving time. All other home equity loans may be extended at management's discretion for an additional   5   year revolving term, subject to an update of certain credit information. 
    
  Credit Commitments 
    
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. At   September 30, 2016  , outstanding commitments totaled   $8.7 billion  . Because some commitments are expected to expire before being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. BOK Financial uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does loans. 
    
  The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based upon management s credit evaluation of the borrower. 

-    76   - 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Because the credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments, BOK Financial uses the same credit policies in evaluating the creditworthiness of the customer. Additionally, BOK Financial uses the same evaluation process in obtaining collateral on standby letters of credit as it does for loan commitments. The term of these standby letters of credit is defined in each commitment and typically corresponds with the underlying loan commitment. At   September 30, 2016  , outstanding standby letters of credit totaled   $500 million  . Commercial letters of credit are used to facilitate customer trade transactions with the drafts being drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated. At   September 30, 2016  , outstanding commercial letters of credit totaled   $5.2 million  . 
    
  Allowances for Credit Losses 
    
  BOK Financial maintains an allowance for loan losses and an accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk. The accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk is maintained at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated losses associated with credit instruments that are not currently recognized as assets such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit or guarantees. As discussed in greater detail in Note   6  , the Company also has separate accruals for off-balance sheet credit risk related to residential mortgage loans previously sold with full or partial recourse and for residential mortgage loans sold to government sponsored agencies under standard representations and warranties. 
    
  The appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit losses (collectively "allowance for credit losses") is assessed by management based on an on-going quarterly evaluation of the probable estimated losses inherent in the portfolio, including probable losses on both outstanding loans and unused commitments.  
    
  The allowance for loan losses consists of specific allowances attributed to impaired loans that have not yet been charged down to amounts we expect to recover, general allowances for unimpaired loans based on estimated loss rates by loan class and nonspecific allowances based on general economic conditions, risk concentration and related factors. There have been no material changes in the approach or techniques utilized in developing the allowance for loan losses and the accrual for off-balance sheet credit losses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Loans are considered to be impaired when it becomes probable that BOK Financial will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements. Internally risk graded loans are evaluated individually for impairment. Substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans and certain residential mortgage and consumer loans are risk graded based on evaluation of the borrowers' ability to repay. Certain commercial loans and most residential mortgage and consumer loans are small balance, homogeneous pools of loans that are not risk graded. Non-risk graded loans are identified as impaired based on performance status. Generally, non-risk graded loans 90 days or more past due or modified in a TDR or in bankruptcy are considered to be impaired. 
    
  Specific allowances for impaired loans are measured by an evaluation of estimated future cash flows discounted at the loans  initial effective interest rate or the fair value of collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. Collateral value of real property is generally based on third party appraisals that conform to Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, less estimated selling costs. Appraised values are on an "as-is" basis and are generally not adjusted by the Company. Updated appraisals are obtained at least annually or more frequently if market conditions indicate collateral values have declined. Collateral value of mineral rights is generally determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows under current market conditions. Collateral values and available cash resources that support impaired loans are evaluated quarterly. Historical statistics may be used as a practical way to estimate impairment in limited situations, such as when a collateral dependent loan is identified as impaired at the end of a reporting period, until an updated appraisal of collateral value is received or a full assessment of future cash flows is completed. Estimates of future cash flows and collateral values require significant judgments and may be volatile. 

-    77   - 

General allowances for unimpaired loans are based on estimated loss rates by loan class. The gross loss rate for each loan class is determined by the greater of the current gross loss rate based on the most recent twelve months or a ten-year gross loss rate. Recoveries are not directly considered in the estimation of loss rates. Recoveries generally do not follow predictable patterns and are not received until well after the charge-off date as a result of protracted legal actions. For risk graded loans, gross loss rates are adjusted for changes in risk grading. For each loan class, the current weighted average risk grade is compared to the long-term average risk grade. This comparison determines whether credit risk in each loan class is increasing or decreasing. Loss rates are adjusted upward or downward in proportion to changes in average risk grading. General allowances for unimpaired loans also consider inherent risks identified for each loan class. Inherent risks consider loss rates that most appropriately represent the current credit cycle and other factors attributable to specific loan classes which have not yet been represented in the gross loss rates or risk grading. These factors include changes in commodity prices or engineering imprecision, which may affect the value of reserves that secure our energy loan portfolio, construction risk that may affect commercial real estate loans, changes in regulations and public policy that may disproportionately impact health care loans and changes in loan products. 
    
  Nonspecific allowances are maintained for risks beyond factors specific to a particular loan or loan class. These factors include trends in the economy of our primary lending areas, concentrations in large balance loans and other relevant factors.  
    
  An accrual for off-balance sheet credit losses is included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The appropriateness of this accrual is determined in the same manner as the allowance for loan losses.  
    
  A provision for credit losses is charged against or credited to earnings in amounts necessary to maintain an appropriate allowance for credit losses. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are added to the allowance when received.

Credit Quality Indicators 
    
  The Company utilizes loan class and risk grading as primary credit quality indicators. Substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans and certain residential mortgage and consumer loans are risk graded based on a quarterly evaluation of the borrowers  ability to repay the loans. Certain commercial loans and most residential mortgage and consumer loans are small, homogeneous pools that are not risk graded.

Loans are considered to be performing if they are in compliance with the original terms of the agreement and currently exhibit no factors that cause management to have doubts about the borrowers' ability to remain in compliance with the original terms of the agreement, which is consistent with the regulatory guideline of  pass.  Performing loans also include past due residential mortgages that are guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government that continue to accrue interest based on criteria of the guarantors' programs. Other loans especially mentioned are currently performing in compliance with the original terms of the agreement but may have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention, consistent with regulatory guidelines.  
    
  The risk grading process identified certain loans that have a well-defined weakness (e.g. inadequate debt service coverage or liquidity or marginal capitalization; repayment may depend on collateral or other risk mitigation) that may jeopardize liquidation of the debt and represent a greater risk due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. This is consistent with the regulatory guideline for  substandard.  Because the borrowers are still performing in accordance with the original terms of the loan agreements, these loans were not placed in nonaccruing status.  
    
  Nonaccruing loans represent loans for which full collection of principal and interest is uncertain. This is substantially the same criteria used to determine whether a loan is impaired and includes certain loans considered  substandard  and all loans considered  doubtful  by regulatory guidelines.

Impaired Loans 
    
  Loans are considered to be impaired when it is probable that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This includes all nonaccruing loans, all loans modified in a TDR and all loans repurchased from GNMA pools.

(  5  )   Acquisitions    
    
  On December 8, 2015, the Company announced the signing of a definitive purchase agreement with MBT Bancshares ( MBT ). MBT is headquartered in Kansas City, Mo. and is the parent company of Missouri Bank and Trust of Kansas City ( mobank ). mobank operates four banking branches in the Kansas City, Mo. area. Under terms of the definitive agreement, BOK Financial will pay   $102.5 million   in an all-cash deal for all outstanding shares of MBT stock, subject to certain conditions and potential adjustments. The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close by the end of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.  
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company acquired Weaver and Tidwell Financial Advisors LTD d/b/a Weaver Wealth Management, a registered investment advisor and E-Spectrum Advisors, an energy investment banking firm in Texas.

  (  6  )   Mortgage Banking Activities    
    
  Residential Mortgage Loan Production 
    
  The Company originates, markets and services conventional and government-sponsored residential mortgage loans. Generally, conforming fixed rate residential mortgage loans are held for sale in the secondary market and non-conforming and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans are retained for investment. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale by the Company are carried at fair value based on sales commitments and market quotes. Changes in the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale are included in Other operating revenue   Mortgage banking revenue. Residential mortgage loans held for sale also includes the fair value of residential mortgage loan commitments and forward sale commitments which are considered derivative contracts that have not been designated as hedging instruments. The volume of mortgage loans originated for sale and secondary market prices are the primary drivers of originating and marketing revenue. 
    
  Residential mortgage loan commitments are generally outstanding for 60 to 90 days, which represents the typical period from commitment to originate a residential mortgage loan to when the closed loan is sold to an investor. Residential mortgage loan commitments are subject to both credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed through underwriting policies and procedures, including collateral requirements, which are generally accepted by the secondary loan markets. Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is partially managed through forward sales of residential mortgage-backed securities and forward sales contracts. These latter contracts set the price for loans that will be delivered in the next 60 to 90 days. 
    
  The unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans held for sale, notional amounts of derivative contracts related to residential mortgage loan commitments and forward contract sales and their related fair values included in Mortgage loans held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were (in thousands): 

No residential mortgage loans held for sale were 90 days or more past due or considered impaired as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   or   September 30, 2015  . No credit losses were recognized on residential mortgage loans held for sale for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  
   -    101   - 

Mortgage banking revenue was as follows (in thousands): 

Production revenue includes gain (loss) on residential mortgage loans held for sale and changes in the fair value of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to residential mortgage loan commitments and forward sales contracts. Servicing revenue includes servicing fee income and late charges on loans serviced for others. 
    
  Residential Mortgage Servicing 
    
  Mortgage servicing rights may be originated or purchased. Both originated and purchased mortgage servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value. The Company has elected to carry all mortgage servicing rights at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for others is the primary driver of servicing revenue.

Changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are included in Other operating revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Changes in fair value due to actual loan payments are included in Mortgage banking costs. Changes in fair value due to market assumption changes are reported separately. Changes in fair value due to market assumption changes during the period relate to assets held at the reporting date. 
    
  There is no active market for trading in mortgage servicing rights after origination. Fair value is determined by discounting the projected net cash flows. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value based on significant unobservable inputs were as follows: 

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as benchmark residential mortgage interest rates directly affect the prepayment speeds used in valuing our mortgage servicing rights, which is partially managed through forward sales of residential mortgage-backed securities and forward sales contracts. A separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing turnover rates, estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults and other relevant factors. The prepayment model is updated daily for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of BOK Financial s servicing portfolio.

   -    103   - 

The interest rate sensitivity of our mortgage servicing rights is modeled over a range of +/- 50 basis points. At   September 30, 2016  , a 50 basis point decrease in mortgage interest rates is expected to decrease the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights by   $52.6 million  . A 50 basis point increase in mortgage interest rates is expected to increase the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights by   $30.6 million  . In the model, changes in the value of servicing rights due to changes in interest rates assume stable relationships between residential mortgage rates and prepayment speeds. Changes in market conditions can cause variations from these assumptions. These factors and others may cause changes in the value of our mortgage servicing rights to differ from our expectations. 
    
  The aging status of our mortgage loans serviced for others by investor at   September 30, 2016   follows (in thousands): 

The Company has off-balance sheet credit risk related to residential mortgage loans sold to U.S. government agencies with recourse prior to 2008 under various community development programs. These loans consist of first lien, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans underwritten to standards approved by the agencies including full documentation and originated under programs available only for owner-occupied properties. However, these loans have a higher risk of delinquency and loss given default than traditional residential mortgage loans. The Company no longer sells residential mortgage loans with recourse other than obligations under standard representations and warranties. The recourse obligation relates to loan performance for the life of the loan and the Company is obligated to repurchase the loan at the time of foreclosure for the unpaid principal balance plus unpaid interest. The principal balance of residential mortgage loans sold subject to recourse obligations totaled   $139 million   at   September 30, 2016  ,   $155 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   $162 million   at   September 30, 2015  . A separate accrual for these off-balance sheet commitments is included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   2 percent   of the loans sold with recourse with an outstanding principal balance of   $3.3 million   were either delinquent more than 90 days, in bankruptcy or in foreclosure and   5 percent   with an outstanding balance of   $7.1 million   were past due 30 to 89 days. The provision for credit losses on loans sold with recourse is included in Mortgage banking costs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The Company also has obligations to repurchase or provide indemnification for residential mortgage loans sold to government sponsored entities due to standard representations and warranties made under contractual agreements and to service loans in accordance with investor guidelines. The Company has established accruals for losses related to these obligations that are included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Mortgage banking costs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
    
  The Company repurchased   2   loans from the agencies for $  309 thousand   during the   third quarter of 2016  . There were   no   indemnifications on loans paid during the   third quarter of 2016  . Losses recognized on repurchases were insignificant.

(  7  )    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities    
    
  Litigation Contingencies 
    
  As a member of Visa, BOK Financial is obligated for a proportionate share of certain covered litigation losses incurred by Visa under a retrospective responsibility plan. A contingent liability was recognized for the Company s share of Visa s covered litigation liabilities. Visa funded an escrow account to cover litigation claims, including covered litigation losses under the retrospective responsibility plan, with proceeds from its initial public offering in 2008 and from available cash. 
    
  BOK Financial currently owns   252,233   Visa Class B shares which are convertible into   415,755   shares of Visa Class A shares after the final settlement of all covered litigation. Class B shares may be diluted in the future if the escrow fund is not adequate to cover future covered litigation costs. Therefore, no value has been currently assigned to the Class B shares and no value may be assigned until the Class B shares are converted into a known number of Class A shares. 
    
  On March 3, 2015, the Bank and the Company were named as defendants in a class action alleging (1) that the manner in which the Bank posted charges to its consumer deposit accounts was improper from September 1, 2011 through July 8, 2014, the period after which the Bank and BOK Financial had settled a class action respecting a similar claim, and before it made changes to its posting order and (2) that the manner in which the Bank posted charges to its small business deposit accounts was improper from July 9, 2009 through July 8, 2014. Following mediation of the case in August 2016, the Class Representatives and the Bank reached a settlement of the action for   $7.8 million  . The settlement is subject to the approval of the Court which the Parties to the Action expect. Management has established an accrual for the settlement.   
    
  On June 24, 2015, the Bank received a complaint alleging that an employee had colluded with a bond issuer and an individual in misusing revenues pledged to municipal bonds for which the Bank served as trustee under the bond indenture. The Company conducted an investigation and concluded that employees in one of its Corporate Trust offices had, with respect to a single group of affiliated bond issuances, violated Company policies and procedures by waiving financial covenants, granting forbearances and accepting without disclosure to the bondholders, debt service payments from sources other than pledged revenues. The relationship manager was terminated. The Company reported the circumstances to, and cooperated with an investigation by, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). On December 28, 2015, in an action brought by the SEC, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a judgment against the principals involved in the issuing the bonds, precluding the principals from denying the alleged violations of the federal securities laws and requiring the principals to pay all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and other amounts required under the bond documents (estimated to be approximately   $73 million  , less the value of the facilities securing repayment of the bonds), subject to oversight by a court appointed monitor. On September 7, 2016, the Bank agreed, and the SEC entered, a consent order finding that the Bank had violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and requiring the Bank to disgorge   $1,067,721   of fees and pay a civil penalty of   $600,000  . The Bank has disgorged the fees and paid the penalty. On January 7, 2016, the terminated employee filed an action against the Bank alleging the Bank defamed the employee and made a  
  
   -    105   - 

demand for indemnification respecting the SEC investigation which demand the respective boards of directors of the Company and the Bank denied. On September 9, 2016, the SEC filed a complaint against the terminated employee alleging the employee violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and requiring the employee to disgorge ill-gotten gains. On September 26, 2016, the employee dismissed the action without prejudice. On August 26, 2016, the Bank was sued in the United States District Court for New Jersey by   two   bondholders in a putative class action on behalf of all holders of the bonds alleging the Bank participated in the fraudulent sale of securities by the principals. On September 14, 2016, the Bank was sued in the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma by   19   bondholders alleging the Bank participated in the fraudulent sale of securities by the principals. Management has been advised by counsel that the Bank has valid defenses to the claims. The Bank expects the Court ordered payment plan will result in the payment of the bonds by the principals. Accordingly, no loss is probable at this time and no provision for loss has been made. If the payment plan does not result in payment of the bonds, a loss could become probable. A reasonable estimate cannot be made at this time though the amount could be material to the Company.  
    
  The Director of the New Mexico Securities Division of the State of New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department ("the Director") issued a Notice of Contemplated Action in connection with the purchase of various municipal bonds by the elected County Treasurer of Bernalillo County, New Mexico, from BOK Financial Securities, Inc., the Company s broker-dealer affiliate. The Notice was settled by a   $125,000   payment to the Division s Educational fund, without any fine, penalty or sanction. The County of Bernalillo, New Mexico, has commenced arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of FINRA seeking recovery of   $5.6 million   arising out of the purchase. The Company has been advised that any recovery by the County is remote. 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, BOK Financial and its subsidiaries are subject to legal actions and complaints. Management believes, based upon the opinion of counsel, that the actions and liability or loss, if any, resulting from the final outcomes of the proceedings, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
                               
  Alternative Investment Commitments 
    
  The Company sponsors two private equity funds and invests in several tax credit entities and other funds as permitted by banking regulations. Consolidation of these investments is based on the variable interest model determined by the nature of the entity. Variable interest entities are generally defined as entities that either do not have sufficient equity to finance their activities without support from other parties or whose equity investors lack a controlling financial interest. Variable interest entities are consolidated based on the determination that the Company is the primary beneficiary including the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the variable interest or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest that could be significant to the variable interest. 
    
  BOKF Equity, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, is the general partner of   two   consolidated private equity funds ( the Funds ). The Funds provide alternative investment opportunities to certain customers, some of which are related parties, through unaffiliated limited partnerships. These unaffiliated limited partnerships generally invest in distressed assets, asset buy-outs or venture capital companies. As general partner, BOKF Equity, LLC has the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the Funds' performance and contingent obligations to make additional investments totaling   $4.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Substantially all of the obligations are offset by limited partner commitments. The Company does not accrue its contingent liability to fund investments. The Volcker Rule in Title VI of the Dodd-Frank Act will limit both the amount and structure of these types of investments.  
    
  Consolidated tax credit investment entities represent the Company's interest in entities earning federal new market tax credits related to qualifying loans. The Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest's economic performance of the entity including being the primary beneficiary of or the obligation to absorb losses of the variable interest that could be significant to the variable interest. 
    
  Other consolidated alternative investments include entities held under merchant banking authority. While the Company owns a majority of the voting interest in these entities, its ability to manage daily operations is limited by applicable banking regulations. Consolidated other assets includes total tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill held by these entities.  

-    106   - 

The Company also has interests in various unrelated alternative investments generally consisting of unconsolidated limited partnership interests in or loans to entities for which investment return is primarily in the form of tax credits or that invest in distressed real estate loans and properties, energy development, venture capital and other activities. The Company is prohibited by banking regulations from controlling or actively managing the activities of these investments and the Company's maximum exposure to loss is restricted to its investment balance. The Company's obligation to fund alternative investments is included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  A summary of consolidated and unconsolidated alternative investments as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015   is as follows (in thousands):

The net asset value of units in these funds was   $1.00   at   September 30, 2016  . An investment in these funds is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or guaranteed by BOK Financial or any of its subsidiaries. BOK Financial may, but is not obligated to purchase assets from these funds to maintain the net asset value at   $1.00  . No assets were purchased from the funds in   2016   or   2015  . 
    
  The Company has agreed to purchase approximately   $7.5 million   of Oklahoma Historic State Income Tax Credits from the George Kaiser Family Foundation, a principal shareholder of BOKF. These credits will be used to reduce the Company's state income tax liability in 2016 and 2017.

AOCI also includes unrealized gains on AFS securities that were transferred from AFS to investment securities in the third quarter of 2011. Such amounts are being amortized over the estimated remaining life of the security as an adjustment to yield, offsetting the related amortization of premium on the transferred securities. Unrealized losses on employee benefit plans will be reclassified into income as pension plan costs are recognized over the remaining service period of plan participants. Accumulated losses on the interest rate lock hedge of the 2005 subordinated debt issuance were reclassified into income over the ten-year life of the debt. Gains and losses in AOCI are net of deferred income taxes.

(  11  )   Fair Value Measurements    
    
  Fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date. Certain assets and liabilities are recorded in the Company s financial statements at fair value. Some are recorded on a recurring basis and some on a non-recurring basis. 
    
  For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. A hierarchy for fair value has been established which categorizes into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels are as follows: 
    
  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets or Liabilities (Level 1) - Fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
    
  Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) - Fair value is based on significant other observable inputs which are generally determined based on a single price for each financial instrument provided to us by an applicable third-party pricing service and is based on one or more of the following: 

Quoted prices for similar, but not identical, assets or liabilities in active markets; 
                
    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; 
                
    Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rate and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; 
                
    Other inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market inputs. 
       
  Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) - Fair value is based upon model-based valuation techniques for which at least one significant assumption is not observable in the market.  
    
  Transfers between levels are recognized as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers in or out of quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments to significant other observable inputs or significant unobservable inputs during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Transfers between significant other observable inputs and significant unobservable inputs during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are included in the summary of changes in recurring fair values measured using unobservable inputs. 
    
  The underlying methods used by the third-party pricing services are considered in determining the primary inputs used to determine fair values. Management has evaluated the methodologies employed by the third-party pricing services by comparing the price provided by the pricing service with other sources, including brokers' quotes, sales or purchases of similar instruments and discounted cash flows to establish a basis for reliance on the pricing service values. Significant differences between the pricing service provided value and other sources are discussed with the pricing service to understand the basis for their values. Based on all observable inputs, management may adjust prices obtained from third-party pricing services to more appropriately reflect the prices that would be received to sell assets or paid to transfer liabilities in orderly transactions in the current market. No significant adjustments were made to prices provided by third-party pricing services at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   or   September 30, 2015  .

Following is a description of the Company's valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis: 
  Securities 
  The fair values of trading, available for sale and fair value option securities are based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets, when available. If quoted prices for identical instruments are not available, fair values are based on significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices of comparable instruments or interest rates and credit spreads, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds and loss severities.  
    
  The fair value of certain available for sale municipal and other debt securities may be based on significant unobservable inputs. These significant unobservable inputs include limited observed trades, projected cash flows, current credit rating of the issuers and, when applicable, the insurers of the debt and observed trades of similar debt. Discount rates are primarily based on references to interest rate spreads on comparable securities of similar duration and credit rating as determined by the nationally-recognized rating agencies adjusted for a lack of trading volume. Significant unobservable inputs are developed by investment securities professionals involved in the active trading of similar securities. A summary of significant inputs used to value these securities follows. A management committee composed of senior members from the Company's Capital Markets, Risk Management and Finance departments assesses the appropriateness of these inputs monthly. 
    
  Derivatives  
    
  All derivative instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values for exchange-traded contracts are based on quoted prices. Fair values for over-the-counter interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange contracts are based on valuations provided either by third-party dealers in the contracts, quotes provided by independent pricing services, or a third-party provided pricing model that uses significant other observable market inputs.  
    
  Credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of derivative instruments. Management determines fair value adjustments based on various risk factors including but not limited to counterparty credit rating or equivalent loan grading, derivative contract notional size, price volatility of the underlying commodity, duration of the derivative contracts and expected loss severity. Expected loss severity is based on historical losses for similarly risk graded commercial loan customers. Decreases in counterparty credit rating or grading and increases in price volatility and expected loss severity all tend to increase the credit quality adjustment which reduces the fair value of asset contracts. The reduction in fair value is recognized in earnings during the current period. 
    
  We also consider our own credit risk in determining the fair value of derivative contracts. Changes in our credit rating would affect the fair value of our derivative liabilities. In the event of a credit downgrade, the fair value of our derivative liabilities would increase. The change in the fair value would be recognized in earnings in the current period. 
  Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale 
  Residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale are based upon quoted market prices of such loans sold in securitization transactions, including related unfunded loan commitments and forward sales contracts. The fair value of mortgage loans that were unable to be sold to U.S. government agencies were determined using quoted prices of loans that are sold in securitization transactions with a liquidity discount applied. 
    
  Other Assets - Private Equity Funds 
  The fair value of the portfolio investments of the Company's two private equity funds is based upon net asset value reported by the underlying funds, as adjusted by the general partner when necessary, as a practical expedient to measure the fair value of the investments in the underlying funds. The Company's private equity funds provide customers alternative investment opportunities as limited partners of the funds. As fund of funds, the private equity funds invest in other limited partnerships or limited liability companies that invest substantially all of their assets in U.S. companies pursuing diversified investment strategies including early-stage venture capital, distressed securities and corporate or asset buy-outs. Private equity fund assets are long-term, illiquid investments. No secondary market exists for these assets. The private equity funds typically invest in funds that provide no redemption rights to investors. The fair value of the private equity investments may only be realized through cash distributions from the underlying funds.  
    
  See Note   7   for disclosure of the fair value of the private equity funds using the net asset value per share of the underlying investments, as a practical expedient, included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company.

The fair value of collateral-dependent impaired loans secured by real estate and real estate and other repossessed assets and the related fair value adjustments are generally based on unadjusted third-party appraisals. Our appraisal review policies require appraised values to be supported by observed inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Appraisals that are not based on observable inputs or that require significant adjustments or fair value measurements that are not based on third-party appraisals are considered to be based on significant unobservable inputs. Non-recurring fair value measurements of collateral-dependent impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets based on significant unobservable inputs are generally due to estimates of current fair values between appraisal dates. Significant unobservable inputs include listing prices for the same or comparable assets, uncorroborated expert opinions or management's knowledge of the collateral or industry. Non-recurring fair value measurements of collateral dependent loans secured by mineral rights are generally determined by our internal staff of engineers on projected cash flows under current market conditions and are based on significant unobservable inputs. Projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of the underlying oil and gas properties. Assets are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current prices with existing conventional equipment, operating methods and costs. Significant unobservable inputs are developed by asset management and workout professionals and approved by senior Credit Administration executives.

Because no market exists for certain of these financial instruments and management does not intend to sell these financial instruments, the fair values shown in the tables above may not represent values at which the respective financial instruments could be sold individually or in the aggregate at the given reporting date. 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments: 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  The book value reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and short-term instruments approximates those assets  fair values. 
    
  Securities 
    
  The fair values of securities are generally based on Significant Other Observable Inputs such as quoted prices for comparable instruments or interest rates and credit spreads, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds and loss severities.  
    
  Loans 
    
  The fair value of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates and credit and liquidity spreads currently being offered for loans with similar remaining terms to maturity and risk, adjusted for the impact of interest rate floors and ceilings which are classified as Significant Unobservable Inputs. The fair values of loans were estimated to approximate their discounted cash flows less loan loss allowances allocated to these loans of   $217 million   at   September 30, 2016  ,   $195 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   $176 million   at   September 30, 2015  . A summary of assumptions used in determining the fair value of loans follows: 

Deposits 
    
  The fair values of time deposits are based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates currently being offered on similar transactions which are considered Significant Unobservable Inputs. Estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, which includes demand deposits, transaction deposits, money market deposits and savings accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand. Although market premiums paid reflect an additional value for these low cost deposits, adjusting fair value for the expected benefit of these deposits is prohibited. Accordingly, the positive effect of such deposits is not included in the tables above.

Other Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures 
    
  The fair values of these instruments are based upon discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates currently being offered on similar instruments which are considered Significant Unobservable Inputs. A summary of assumptions used in determining the fair value of other borrowing and subordinated debentures follows: 

Off-Balance Sheet Instruments 
    
  The fair values of commercial loan commitments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements. The fair values of these off-balance sheet instruments were not significant at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   or   September 30, 2015  . 
  Fair Value Election 
    
  As more fully disclosed in Note   2   and Note   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to carry all residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and U.S. Treasury securities held as economic hedges against changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and all residential mortgage loans originated for sale at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are recognized in earnings.
