PHYSICAL PROPERTY HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   
   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Physical Property Holdings Inc. and the subsidiaries that it controls (collectively referred to as the "Company"). The Company, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in the real estate business by holding five residential apartments in Hong Kong. Unless otherwise specified in the text, references to the Company include the Company and its subsidiaries. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  
     
  Translation of amounts from Hong Kong Dollars ("HK$") into United States Dollars ("US$") for the convenience of the readers has been made at the exchange rate of US$1.00 = HK$7.8. No representation is made that the Hong Kong Dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into United States Dollars, at that rate on September 30, 2016 or at any other certain rate.  
     
  The Company had negative working capital of HK$12,445,000 as of September 30, 2016 and incurred losses of HK$511,000 and HK$556,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. These conditions raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  
     
  Continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon attaining profitable operations in the future, exercising tight cost and cash flow controls measures, and the financial support from the Principal Stockholder.  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  
     
  The Principal Stockholder has undertaken to make available adequate funds to the Company as and when required to maintain the Company as a going concern.  Having taken into consideration the undertaking provided by the Principal Stockholder, management believes that the Company will be able to settle its liabilities when they become due.  However, there can be no assurance that the financing from the Principal Stockholder will be continued.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Ngai Keung Luk ( Mr. Luk ), Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and the Principal Stockholder, made a net advance of HK$733,000 or US$94,000 to the Company as described in Note 5 below.  Mr. Luk owns 94.5% of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the date this quarterly report is filed.  
     
  The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date this quarterly report is filed.  

2. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ). The guidance requires the lessee to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases with terms of 12 months or more. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the guidance and its impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

  During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company repaid HK$454,000 and HK$396,000 of its existing bank loans, respectively. The outstanding loan balances as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are analyzed as follows:  

Payables during the following periods according to bank repayment terms notices   

As the bank loans are repayable on demand upon request at the bank s discretion, regardless of the expected repayment dates of the outstanding loan principals as set out in the repayment terms notices issued by the bank, the entire balance of the bank loans is presented as current liabilities in the condensed   consolidated balance sheet.    
     
  The collateral of the bank loans includes:

In addition, during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a related company which is controlled by the Principal Stockholder of the Company, provided office space and general support for the Company s activities with an aggregate charge of HK$63  0,000.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED IN PART 1, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. PROSPECTIVE SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT SEVERAL FACTORS GOVERN WHETHER ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CONTAINED HEREIN WILL BE OR CAN BE ACHIEVED. ANY ONE OF THOSE FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED HEREIN. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE PLANS AND OBJECTIVES OF MANAGEMENT FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PLANS AND OBJECTIVES RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS AND THE FUTURE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY. ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE FOREGOING INVOLVE JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUTURE ECONOMIC, COMPETITIVE AND MARKET CONDITIONS, FUTURE BUSINESS DECISIONS, AND THE TIME AND MONEY REQUIRED TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT ACCURATELY AND MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE STATEMENTS THAT ARE NOT HISTORICAL FACTS AND CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY TERMS SUCH AS  ANTICIPATE,   BELIEVE,   COULD,   SEEK,   ESTIMATE,   EXPECT,   INTEND,   MAY,   PLAN,   POTENTIAL,   PREDICT,   PROJECT,   SHOULD,   WILL,   WOULD  OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS AND THE NEGATIVES OF THOSE TERMS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN ARE REASONABLE, ANY OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS COULD PROVE INACCURATE AND, THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE RESULTS CONTEMPLATED IN ANY OF THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN WILL BE REALIZED. BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, THE COMPANY MAY ALTER ITS MARKETING, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PLANS OR OTHER BUDGETS, WHICH MAY IN TURN AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED THEREIN, THE INCLUSION OF ANY SUCH STATEMENT SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS A REPRESENTATION BY THE COMPANY OR ANY OTHER PERSON THAT THE OBJECTIVES OR PLANS OF THE COMPANY WILL BE ACHIEVED.

  The following table sets forth selected data as a percentage of total operating revenue for the periods indicated.

Table Of Contents 

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED) COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)   
     
  OPERATING REVENUES. Operating revenues for the third quarter of 2016 totaled HK$288,000 (US$37,000) compared to HK$254,000 for the corresponding period in 2015. This represented an increase of 13% mainly because a unit being vacant for two months in the third quarter of the last year was rented out subsequently.  
     
  OPERATING EXPENSES. The Company's operating expenses totaled HK$419,000 (US$54,000), or 145% of operating revenues, for the third quarter of 2016, compared to HK$4  01,000, or 158% of operating revenues, for the third quarter of 2015. This represented an increase of 4%, mainly because of increase in rates and government rent, and repair costs being incurred in relation to a new tenancy in this quarter.  
     
  TOTAL NON-OPERATING EXPENSES. Total non-operating expenses for the third quarter of 2016 totaled HK$36,000 (US$5,000) compared to HK$39,000 for the third quarter of 2015. This represented a decrease of 8% due to reduction in interest expenses attributable to the decrease in average loan balances as a result of the progress on repayment.  
     
  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Company did not make any tax provision for the third quarter in view of the losses incurred.  
     
  NET LOSS AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. The Company has recorded a net loss and total comprehensive loss of HK$167,000 (US$22,000) for the third quarter of 2016, compared to a net loss and total comprehensive loss of HK$186,000 for the third quarter of 2015. This represented a decrease in loss of 1  0% due to the net effect of the increase in rental income and the increase in operating expenses as mentioned above.  
     
   NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED) COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)   
     
  OPERATING REVENUES. Operating revenues for the nine months of 2016 totaled HK$842,000 (US$108,000) compared to HK$776,000 for the corresponding period in 2015. This represented an increase of 9% mainly due to rental increase for a property which was vacant for five months in the same period of the last year and was rented out subsequently.  
     
  OPERATING EXPENSES. The Company's operating expenses totaled HK$1,242,000 (US$159,000), or 148% of operating revenues, for the first nine months of 2016, compared to HK$1,213,000, or 156% of operating revenues, for the first nine months of 2015. This represented an increase of 2% mainly because of increase in rates and government rent, and repair costs being incurred in relation to a new tenancy in the first nine months of 2016  .  
     
  TOTAL NON-OPERATING EXPENSES. Total non-operating expenses for the first nine months of 2016 totaled HK$111,000 (US$14,000) compared to HK$119,000 for the first nine months of 2015. This represented a decrease of 7% due to reduction in interest expenses attributable to the decrease in average loan balances as a result of the progress on repayment.  
     
  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Company did not make any tax provision for the period under review because there were losses incurred.  
     
  NET LOSS AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. The Company has recorded a net loss and total comprehensive loss of HK$511,000 (US$65,000) for the first nine months of 2016, compared to a net loss and total comprehensive loss of HK$556,000 for the first nine months of 2015. This represented a decrease in loss of 8% due to the net effect of the increase in rental income and the increase in operating expenses as mentioned above.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
     
  The Company has financed its operations primarily through advances from the Principal Stockholder.  
     
  Cash and cash equivalent balances as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were HK$131,000 (US$17,000) and HK$102,000, respectively.  
     
  Net cash used in operating activities was HK$249,000 (US$32,000) and HK$354,000 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  Net cash used in investing activities which represents increase in bank deposit, was HK$1,000 and NIL for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  Net cash provided by financing activities, which mainly includes repayment of bank loans and advances from the Principal Stockholder, were HK$279,000 (US$36,000) and HK$484,000 during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not entered into any transactions using derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments or held any marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies.  
     
  Consistent with the general practice of lessors of residential apartments, the Company receives monthly rentals, which are due on the first day of each billing period and are non-refundable. This practice creates working capital that the Company generally utilizes for working capital purposes.  
     
  The Company has no trade receivable balance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company obtains rental deposits from its tenants and has never experienced any significant problems with collection of accounts receivable. No provision for doubtful receivables is therefore made for the period under review.  
     
  During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no purchases of investments.  
     
  Management believes that cash flow generated from the operations of the Company, the tight cost and cash flow control measures and the existing cash and bank balances on hand should be sufficient to satisfy the working capital requirement of the Company for at least the next 12 months as the Principal Stockholder has confirmed his intention to make available adequate funds to the Company as and when required to maintain the Company as a going concern.  However, there can be no assurance that the financing from him will be continued.  
     
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, the Company uses estimates based on the best information available for such items as depreciable lives. The Company revises the recorded estimates when better information is available, facts change or actual amounts can be determined. These revisions can affect operating results.  
     
  The critical accounting policies and use of estimates are discussed in and should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated audited financial statements and notes included in the Company s latest 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 23, 2016, which includes audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.

ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
     
  The operations of the Company are solely in Hong Kong and they are subject to risks associated with, among others, interest rate and liquidity risk. These risks have similar considerations and risks typically associated with investments in the real estate market of the United States and Western European countries. These are described further in the following:  
     
   INTEREST RATE RISK   
     
  The Company s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to its long term debt obligations with a floating interest rate.  The Company monitors the movement of interest rates on an ongoing basis and evaluates the exposure of its debt obligations.  
     
   LIQUIDITY RISK   
     
  The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported a negative working capital of HK$12,445,000, of which HK$6,177,000 would be due for repayment over one year according to the latest repayment terms notices issued by the bank, and a net loss of HK$511,000. The Company has relied on private financing from the Principal Stockholder of the Company, who has confirmed his intention to make available adequate funds to the Company as and when required to maintain the Company as a going concern. However, there can be no assurance that the financing from him will be continued. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include or reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  
     
    ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
     
  The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) of the Company have concluded, based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2016, that the design and operation of the Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act")) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by the Company under the Exchange Act is accumulated, recorded, processed, summarized and reported to the management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding whether or not disclosure is required.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

a.   
 
  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;     

b.   
 
  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
