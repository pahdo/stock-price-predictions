   (Expressed in United States Dollars)   

Note     1          Basis of Presentation and Going Concern    
     
   Description of the Company and Business   
     
  Altair Nanotechnologies Inc., (the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation that develops, manufactures and sells nano lithium titanate batteries and energy storage systems. The Company s nano lithium titanate battery systems offer higher power density, longer cycle life, rapid charge and discharge capabilities, a wider operating temperature range and higher levels of safety than conventional lithium-ion batteries. The Company targets applications that utilize the key attributes of its technology with product applications mainly found in the electric grid, transportation (commercial vehicles), and industrial market segments.  
     
   Basis of Presentation   
     
  The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Altair Nanotechnologies Inc. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) are unaudited. These condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary by management to fairly state the Company s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. The 2015 year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). This Form 10-Q (this  Report ) should be read in conjunction with the Company s Comprehensive Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2015, which includes all disclosures required by GAAP.   
     
   Going Concern   
     
  The Company anticipates to continue to have negative cash flows from operations as it ramps up production at their new manufacturing facilities. If the Company is not able to refinance its debt or obtain additional capital, the Company will not be able to pay off its current debt obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The company condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  
      
  The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately generate revenues at a level that will result in profitability and positive cash flows from operations. To address these matters, we are taking actions to refinance existing loans if needed, obtain capital leases, obtain additional loans collateralized by the Land Use Rights, third party guarantees and other assets, and obtain approval for additional grant incentives from the government of Wu an, China. However, there can be no assurance that additional grant funds to support our capital needs will be available to us and that we will be able to refinance existing loans, obtain additional loans, or raise further funds through other sources such as through an equity offering. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions, be on terms that are not satisfactory to us, or contain covenants on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of convertible debt and equity financing.  
      
   Principles of Consolidation    
     
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries which include (1) Altair U.S. Holdings, (2) Altairnano, Inc., (3) Altair Nanotechnologies (China) Co., Ltd., and (4) Northern Altair Nanotechnologies Co., Ltd. All of the subsidiaries are either incorporated in the United States of America or China. Inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  
     
   Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Guidance   
     
  Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
   (Expressed in United States Dollars)   

Note 2            Restricted Cash    
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash of $0.23 million and $0.23 million are restricted as performance guarantee for China State Grid Project, respectively.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash of $0.25 million and $nil are restricted as settlement fee for legal counselling, respectively.  

Note 3          Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Measurements    
     
  The carrying amounts of cash,    accounts receivable,   accounts payable, and notes payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the Company s short term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk. The Company performs recurring fair-value measurements for its warrant liabilities.   
     
  The fair values and corresponding classifications under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy of outstanding warrants recorded as recurring liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet were recorded using level 3 inputs based on a Monte Carlo option simulation model, which uses prevailing interest rates, Company s stock price volatility and expected warrant term. Based on the valuation model used by the Company, the value of the warrant liability was determined to be $nil for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The change in the fair value of the warrants are recorded in Other (expense) income for each of the periods presented.  
     
  During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company has entered into several agreements to provide financial guarantees in relation to the EV Bus sales (See Note 4). The Company engaged a third party valuation expert to determine the fair value of the financial guarantees. Fair value (level 3) of the financial guarantee at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to $nil and $0.21 million, respectively.    

NOTE 4   ELECTRIC BUS SALES   
       
    On April 19, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement (the  Agreement") with Wu an Municipal People's Government ("Wu'an") and Handan Municipal People's Government ("Handan Government") regarding the establishment by Altair China of a manufacturing facility in the City of Wu'an, in Hebei Province in China. The Agreement also indicates the purchase by Wu'an and Handan of EV Buses beginning in late 2012 and continuing over five years, and the future purchase of electric taxis and energy storage systems.   
     
 No EV Buses were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
     
  In connection with the bus sales to Handan, the Company agreed to provide to a third-party leasing entity a security deposit equals to 20% of the contract price. The security deposit is refundable over a ten-year period when Handan completes its obligations to the third-party leasing entity. The difference between the present value of the refundable security deposit and the gross amount was recorded as current period expense and unearned interest income to the security deposit. The unearned interest income is being amortized straight line over the refund period of 10 years.   
      
  In addition, the Company agreed to pay an initial 8% of the contract price for rebates and to make subsequent quarterly payments, for a ten-year period, to a third-party leasing company as an incentive. The net present value of the quarterly payments is recorded as current period expense. The difference between the present value of subsequent quarterly payments and the gross amount was recorded as unrecognized interest expense and then amortized over ten-year period.

    Litigation    
     
  We are involved in certain legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Legal expenses associated with the contingency are expensed as incurred. Material legal proceedings that are currently pending are as follows:  
   
    In re Altair Nanotechnologies Shareholder Derivative Litigation,    1:14-cv-09418, 1:14-cv-09958 (S.D.N.Y.) : In late 2014, two shareholder derivative actions were filed against certain current and former officers and directors of the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Altair was named as a nominal defendant. The two cases, which were consolidated on May 15, 2015, allege violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on substantially the same facts underlying the putative securities litigation. As of the balance sheet date, the Company did not have reasonable estimation of settlement amount. In July 2016, certain parties executed a stipulation of settlement, without defendants admitting liability, whereby Altair agreed to adopt certain governance proposals and pay an amount not exceeding $150,000 in plaintiffs  attorneys  fees and expenses. The court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement on August 22, 2016, and has scheduled a settlement hearing for January 9, 2017.  If the settlement receives final approval, this action will be dismissed in its entirety.  Notice of the proposed settlement is available on Altair s website.  A summary notice has also been published online.     
   
    In the Matter of Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc.     (LA-4452):   In or around January 2015, SEC opened an investigation into the resignation of Crowe Horwath LLP ( Crowe ) as Altair s independent auditor in August 2014.  As part of its investigation, the SEC issued several subpoenas to the Company and its current and former officers relating to Crowe s resignation and a Form 8-K filed by the Company on March 13, 2015.  On May 4, 2016, the SEC sent Altair a Wells Notice identifying possible violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  On August 29, 2016, the Company made an offer of settlement to the SEC whereby it consented to the entry of an order, without admitting or denying the findings therein except as to the SEC s jurisdiction, that the Company:  (i) cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; (ii) make certain filings with the SEC by November 15, 2016 or have the registration of its securities under the Exchange Act revoked; and (iii) pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $250,000 within 10 days of the entry of the order.  Such offer of settlement was accepted by the SEC and resulted in a Release No. 78997 dated September 29, 2016 with respect to the same. As of the balance sheet date, the Company did not have reasonable estimation of settlement amount. In August 2016, the Company accrued $250,000 and deposited the funds into escrow which was paid from escrow to the SEC in October 2016.

  We are a Delaware corporation that develops, manufactures and sells nano lithium titanate batteries and energy storage systems. Our nano lithium titanate battery systems offer higher power density, longer cycle life, rapid charge and discharge capabilities, a wider operating temperature range and higher levels of safety than conventional lithium-ion batteries. We target applications that effectively utilize the key attributes of our technology, and these applications can be found primarily in the electric grid, transportation (commercial vehicles), and industrial market segments.  
     
  In April 2012, we formed Altair Nanotechnologies (China) Co., Ltd. ( Altair China ) and Northern Altair Nanotechnologies Co., Ltd. ( Northern Altair ) in order to aggregate key elements of our supply chain and expand into the Chinese market. In January 2014, our Board of Directors approved plans to consolidate all U.S. manufacturing operations and transition manufacturing to Wu an, China. Effective in early 2016, the majority of our principal assets and operations are now located in China.  
     
  In 2013, we transferred the production of our nLTO material to the New Energy Industrial Park in Wu an city, Hebei province, China. We built, installed and further improved the manufacturing of our nLTO. In 2013, a 150 metric ton per year manufacturing line was completed and put into production as our phase one nLTO production line. In the same year, to meet the high demand of Lithium batteries in the China market, we completed the business process of sourcing the equipment to be procured for the phase two nLTO production line, under the joint efforts of the Altair U.S. and Altair China teams. This nLTO line was put into production in fourth quarter of 2015 and has reached an annual production capacity of 2,250 metric tons during 2016, with an expected annual capacity of 3,000 metric tons. We built a phase three nLTO production line and it was completed and installed in the fourth quarter of 2016 with an annual production capacity of 3,500 metric tons.  

21

As of January 2016, the module production was transferred from Anderson, Indiana to our manufacturing location in Wu an, China. In the U.S., we are maintaining some of our core R D personnel, who provide technical transfer and services to our China entities in the areas of core R D, engineering operational capabilities and technologies that influence our manufacturing in Wu an, China.   
     
  In 2014, in order to further cut the cost of our products, improve product chain management efficiencies, and effectively serve the large market in China, we built two battery module production lines with an expected total capacity of approximately 6,000 modules per year. In the first quarter of 2016, we transferred the U.S. module production line to China. We are expecting the three battery module production lines to reach an estimated total capacity of 9,000 modules per year by the end of 2016.   
     
  We have completed the technology and production validation of our Gen 4 modules with China produced nLTO and China made module parts. The Gen 2 modules is still be available in 2016. Both Gen 2 and Gen 4 products have passed the United Nations ( UN ), International Standards Organization ( ISO ), SAE International ( SAE ) and International Electrochemical Commission ( IEC ) testing and reports are being generated by T V S D ( TUV ). TUV, a German based company, who has a test facility in China and results are generally accepted by the UN and U.S. In December 2015, our battery module production line in the U.S. was discontinued. We were able to maintain a very stable period of time overlapping production while transferring the battery module production from the U.S. to China, without any impact on customer order delivery. Our battery modules have been generally used in EV Buses, trolley buses and hoisting equipment in the Europe and the U.S markets. Our OEM cell producer s capacity can reach 70,000 Altair format cells per year. Sometime in the near future, we expect to validate another OEM cell producer to reduce dependency on one supplier, which will provide competition between suppliers and reduce costs for Altair.   
     
  We plan on building and validating ALTI-ESS (energy storage systems) production capabilities in China and export them to Europe, the U.S. and to other countries of the world.   
     
  We now have a battery management system ( BMS ) distribution center in Europe to provide improved efficiency and timely delivery of our supply of the BMS units to our European customers. Our BMS supplier has a production base in China, which we believe will meet the demand of the China market.   
     
  By building manufacturing and assembly facilities in Wu an, China for our nLTO material, battery cells and modules, and soon our energy storage systems, we have centered the whole supply chain in China. In adopting this strategy, we expect to significantly reduce costs, shorten lead times, reduce cash flow pressures, improve the quality and production management efficiency and increase our profit.

The Company received proceeds on the fixed assets sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and did not have sell any fixed assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Interest expense, net:  Interest expense, net increased to $2.55 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $1.89 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.66 million or 35%. The increase was mainly attributable to the interest expense in the China operations increased by $0.75 million due to higher debt balances and new capital leases during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.     The U.S. operations which interest expense decreased by $0.09 million due to lower loan balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  
     
  Change in fair value of warrants:  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a gain of $1 thousand and a gain of $5 thousand, respectively, due to the change in the fair value of warrants outstanding that we previously issued. 
     
   Gain (loss) on foreign exchange:  Transaction gains or losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation on transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional currency represented a gain of $0.09 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The decrease was mainly due to no bus sales incurred and $0.02 million was amortization of financial guaranty during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 on buses sold in prior periods as compared to 75 buses sold during the same period in 2015.  

25

Other expenses - buses:  Other expenses - buses amounted to nil and $13.66 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This was due to no bus sales recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 75 buses sold in same period in 2015.  
     
   Other income:  Other income amounted to $3.05 million and $0.50 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, an increase of $2.55 million or 515%. The increase is primarily due to $2.90 million grant incentives recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   Net loss:  Net loss decreased by $11.74 million, or 89%, to $1.46 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $13.20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss was driven by an increase of $8.67 million in gross profit and an increase of $4.13 million in total other income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  Our working (deficit) capital is as follows (In thousands of dollars):  

At September 30, 2016, we had a working deficit of $60.88 million compared to working deficit of $47.85 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in net working deficit was primarily related to a decline in short term investment of $25.41 million and an increase of $40.93 million in amount due to related parties.   
     
  A summary of our cash flow activities is as follows (In thousands of dollars):  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
      
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $25.97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The net decrease in cash from operations resulted from a net increase of $4.51 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to the increase of prepaid VAT during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the net decrease of $26.60 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to the collection of other receivables related to bus sales in the same period of 2015, offset by $1.46 million in net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the net loss of $13.20 million in 2015.  
      
  Net cash provided in investing was $0.61 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used of $32.51 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash provided in investing activities was driven by the amount of matured time deposit in China, offset by our purchases of production equipment and construction of production facilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  Net cash used by financing activities was $13.29 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net cash provided of $18.31 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash from financing activities primarily related to repayments on notes payable, offset by the proceeds received on notes payable to related parties.  
     
   Going Concern   
      
  We incurred a net loss of $1.46 million for nine months ended September 30, 2016, and we had an accumulated deficit of $273.95 million and a negative working capital of $60.88 million as of September 30, 2016. In addition, the Company anticipates to continue to have negative cash flows from operations as it ramps up production at their new manufacturing facilities. If the Company is not able to refinance its debt or obtain additional capital, the Company will not be able to pay off its current debt obligations. The company financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

27

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately generate revenues at a level that will result in profitability and positive cash flows from operations. To address these matters, we are taking actions to pay off loans when due, refinance existing loans if needed, obtain capital leases, obtain additional loans collateralized by the Land Use Rights, third party guarantees and other assets, and obtain approval for additional grant incentives from the government of Wu an, China. However, there can be no assurance that additional grant funds to support our capital needs will be available to us and that we will be able to refinance existing loans, obtain additional loans, or raise further funds through other sources such as through an equity offering. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions, be on terms that are not satisfactory to us, or contain covenants on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of convertible debt and equity financing.  
      
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of the SEC s Regulation S-K.  
     
   Capital Commitments- Fixed Assets   
     
    The Company has contractual obligations to suppliers of machine and equipment related to future capital expenditures as of September 30, 2015. The Company's commitment for minimum payment under these contractual obligations as of September 30, 2015 is $18.60 million. As of September 30, 2016, $15.87 million and $2.73 million of these contractual obligations would be fulfilled in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  
   
   Debt    
  As of September 30, 2016, we are required to pay principal amounts of $8.10 million within next year and the remainder of $14.36 million payable in five years.   
     
    Capital Commitments - Production Plant    
     
                As discussed further in Note 9, in conjunction with the Land Use Rights obtained by Northern Altair, the Company agreed to make fixed asset investments on the land of approximately $314.85 million, subject to loan guarantees and other incentives from Wu an, China, over an unspecified period of time up to the 50-year life of the Land Use Rights, with initial construction occurring in 2013. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining commitment is $230.11 million.  
     
    Lease    
    
  The Company leases a 70,000 square feet facility in Flagship Business Accelerator Building located at 3019 Enterprise Drive, Anderson, Indiana under a triple net lease with Flagship Enterprise Center, Inc. The facility was used for the production of prototype batteries and battery systems.  The lease amended on January 27, 2015 will expire on June 30, 2017. Any lease renewal options will be negotiated no less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of this lease. Annual rent under this lease is $0.26 million plus IT fees, utilities and maintenance. Effective May 1, 2016, the Company agreed to pay $0.14 million as a payment to terminate the lease effective by the end of May 2016. Use of the facility has been agreed upon until a new tenant is found. The landlord will give the Company thirty-day notice at their discretion to vacate the premises. The Company expects to find new office space for the current employees in the general Anderson, Indiana area at a reduced rate and space requirement by the end of the second quarter of 2017.  
      
    Capital Lease Obligations    
     
                  On August 8, 2016, the Company entered into a financing arrangement with a third party to purchase machinery and equipment utilized in production. The lease term is initially for five years and contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, the lessor has the rights to (i) reduce the lease term from five years to three years or (ii) upon default by the Company, the lessor has the right to convert the remaining balance owed under the financing arrangement into the equity of the Company. At September 30, 2016, the total present value of the net minimum payments on capital leases is $9.17 million. The net present value of capital lease obligation, less current portion is $8.83 million as of September 30, 2016.

Item 3.             Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    
     
  As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.  

Item 4.     Controls and Procedure    
     
   Disclosure Controls and Procedures .  Based on an evaluation required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 which is the end of the interim quarter and annual periods covered by this Quarterly Report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d-e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are not effective and there is as of such dates a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures. This material weakness is rooted in the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, as a result of which we were late, and prior to this Quarterly Report, have not filed any required periodic reports since 2013.   
     
   Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(d-f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:  

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;    

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;    

provide reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and    

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.     
     
  Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   
     
   Item 1. Legal Proceedings .  
     
  With respect to previously reported legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations or financial position, there were no material developments during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 except as follows:  
     
    In re Altair Nanotechnologies Shareholder Derivative Litigation, 1:14-cv-09418, 1:14-cv-09958 (S.D.N.Y.):     In late 2014, two shareholder derivative actions were filed against certain current and former officers and directors of the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Altair was named as a nominal defendant. The two cases, which were consolidated on May 15, 2015, allege violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on substantially the same facts underlying the putative securities litigation. In July 2016, certain parties executed a stipulation of settlement, without defendants admitting liability, whereby Altair agreed to adopt certain governance proposals and pay an amount not exceeding $150,000 in plaintiffs  attorneys  fees and expenses. The court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement on August 22, 2016, and has scheduled a settlement hearing for January 9, 2017.  If the settlement receives final approval, this action will be dismissed in its entirety.  Notice of the proposed settlement is available on Altair s website.  A summary notice has also been published online.     
     
    In the Matter of Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. (LA-4452):     In or around January 2015, SEC opened an investigation into the resignation of Crowe Horwath LLP ( Crowe ) as Altair s independent auditor in August 2014.  As part of its investigation, the SEC issued several subpoenas to the Company and its current and former officers relating to Crowe s resignation and a Form 8-K filed by the Company on March 13, 2015.  On May 4, 2016, the SEC sent Altair a Wells Notice identifying possible violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  On August 29, 2016, the Company made an offer of settlement to the SEC whereby it consented to the entry of an order, without admitting or denying the findings therein except as to the SEC s jurisdiction, that the Company:  (i) cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; (ii) make certain filings with the SEC by November 15, 2016 or have the registration of its securities under the Exchange Act revoked; and (iii) pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $250,000 within 10 days of the entry of the order.  Such offer of settlement was accepted by the SEC and resulted in a Release No. 78997 dated September 29, 2016 with respect to the same. In August 2016, the Company accrued $250,000 and deposited the funds into escrow which was paid from escrow to the SEC in October 2016.  
     
   Item 1A. Risk Factors   
     
  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
