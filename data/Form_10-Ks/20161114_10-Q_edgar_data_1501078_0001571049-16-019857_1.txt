(1)    BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Oconee Federal Financial Corp., which include the accounts of its wholly owned subsidiary Oconee Federal
Savings and Loan Association (the  Association ) (referred to herein as  the Company,   we, 
 us,  or  our ) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated during consolidation.
The Company is majority owned (71.76%) by Oconee Federal, MHC. These financial statements do not include the transactions
and balances of Oconee Federal, MHC. 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to
present fairly the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and the results of operations
and cash flows for the interim periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All interim amounts have not been audited, and the results
of operations for the interim periods herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the
year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

Certain amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on net income or shareholders  equity
as previously reported. 

Cash Flows:    Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand, federal funds sold, overnight interest-bearing deposits and amounts due from other depository
institutions. 

Use of Estimates:    To
prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.
These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the disclosures provided,
and actual results could differ. 

(2)    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15 Statement of
Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 provides cash flow statement
classification guidance for certain transactions including how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts
and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance is effective for public business entities for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied retrospectively.
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is assessing ASU 2016-15 but does not expect
a significant impact on its accounting and disclosures. 

In June 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
The provisions of ASU 2016-13 were issued to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the
expected credit losses on financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held
for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other commitments to
extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized
cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the
amortized cost basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 eliminate the probable incurred loss recognition in current GAAP and reflect
an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical
experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets. 

For purchased financial
assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ( PCD assets ) that are measured
at amortized cost, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit
loss expense. Subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses on PCD assets are recognized through the statement of income
as a credit loss expense.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

 (Amounts in thousands, except share and
per share data) 

Credit losses relating
to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write-down
to the security. 

ASU 2016-13 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its accounting and disclosures. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in
the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee s
shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election for
forfeitures as they occur. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that this new guidance
will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Other accounting standards that have been
issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

(3)    EARNINGS PER SHARE ( EPS )  

Basic EPS is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding and is adjusted for ESOP shares not yet committed to be released. Unvested restricted stock
awards, which contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends, are considered participating securities and the two-class method of
computing basic and diluted EPS is applied. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock, such as outstanding stock options, were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in
the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding to include the effect of contracts or securities exercisable (such as stock
options) or which could be converted into common stock, if dilutive, using the treasury stock method. The factors used in the earnings
per common share computation follow:    

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, 28,700 and 15,400 shares, respectively, were considered anti-dilutive as the exercise price was below the average
market price for the respective periods.

(4)    SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE  

Debt, mortgage-backed and equity securities
have been classified in the consolidated balance sheets according to management s intent. U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed
securities consist of securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises. Investment securities
at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 are as follows: 

Securities pledged at September 30, 2016
and June 30, 2016 had carrying amounts of $6,075 and $6,114, respectively. These securities were pledged to secure public deposits. 

At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises,
in an amount greater than 10% of shareholders  equity. 

Table of Contents   

OCONEE FEDERAL FINANCIAL CORP. 

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

 (Amounts in thousands, except share and
per share data) 

The following tables show the fair value
and unrealized loss of securities that have been in unrealized loss positions for less than twelve months and for more than twelve
months at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The tables also show the number of securities in an unrealized loss position for
each category of investment security as of the respective dates. 

(1)  Actual amounts.    

The Company evaluates securities for other-than-temporary
impairments ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such
evaluation. The Company considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial
condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Additionally, the Company considers its intent to sell or whether it will be more
likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to the security's anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing
an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by federal Government agencies, whether
downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer's financial condition. 

None of the unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 were
recognized into net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 because the issuers  bonds are of high credit quality,
management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their
anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates. The fair value of these securities
is expected to recover as they approach their maturity date or reset date. None of the unrealized losses at June 30, 2016 were
recognized as having OTTI during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Income is not recognized on PCI
loans if the Company cannot reasonably estimate cash flows expected to be collected. The carrying amount of such loans at
September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

The following tables present the aging
of past due loans as well as nonaccrual loans. Nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more include both smaller

Troubled Debt Restructurings:  

At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
total loans that have been modified as troubled debt restructurings were $1,590 and $1,588, respectively, which consisted of two
agricultural loans, two home equity lines of credit, and one one-four family first liens at June 30, 2016 and an additional one-to-four
family loan at September 30, 2016. All loans were acquired and initially recorded at fair value. An additional allowance of $47
and $55 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, has been specifically reserved for these loans. Additionally, there
were no commitments to lend any additional amounts under either loan or any payment default on any loan after the modification.
The one troubled debt restructuring during the three months ended September 30, 2016 involved renewal of a loan at a higher loan-to-value
ratio than is offered on similar loans. No reductions of principal or interest rates were granted. No loans restructured
during the past twelve months defaulted. 

Loan Grades:   

The Company utilizes a grading system whereby
all loans are assigned a grade based on the risk profile of each loan. Loan grades are determined based on an evaluation of relevant
information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience,
credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. All loans, regardless of size, are
analyzed and are given a grade based upon the management s assessment of the ability of borrowers to service their debts. 

Pass: Loan assets of this grade conform
to a preponderance of our underwriting criteria and are acceptable as a credit risk, based upon the current net worth and paying
capacity of the obligor. Loans in this category also include loans secured by liquid assets and secured loans to borrowers with
unblemished credit histories. 

Pass-Watch: Loan assets of this grade represent
our minimum level of acceptable credit risk. This grade may also represent obligations previously rated  Pass , but
with significantly deteriorating trends or previously rated. 

Special Mention: Loan assets of this grade
have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may
result in deterioration of repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 

Substandard: Loan assets of this grade
are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans
so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by
the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful
have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection
or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Portfolio Segments:  

One-to-four family:  One-to-four
family residential loans consist primarily of loans secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary residences, and are originated
as adjustable-rate or fixed-rate loans for the construction, purchase or refinancing of a mortgage. These loans are collateralized
by owner-occupied properties located in the Company's market area. The Company currently originates residential mortgage loans
for our portfolio with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% for traditional owner-occupied homes. 

For traditional homes, the Company may
originate loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% if the borrower obtains mortgage insurance or provides readily marketable
collateral. The Company may make exceptions for special loan programs that we offer. For example, the Company currently offers
mortgages of up to $95 with loan-to-value ratios of up to 95% to low- to moderate-income borrowers solely for the purchase of their
primary residence. The Company also originates residential mortgage loans for non-owner-occupied homes with loan-to-value ratios
of up to 80%. 

The Company has historically originated
residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 75% for manufactured or modular homes.  The
Company no longer offers residential mortgage loans for manufactured or modular homes as of December 1, 2014. However, renewals
of existing performing credits that meet the Company s underwriting requirements will be considered.  The Company requires
lower loan-to-value ratios for manufactured and modular homes because such homes tend to depreciate over time. Manufactured or
modular homes must be permanently affixed to a lot to make them more difficult to move without the Company s permission.
Such homes must be  de-titled  by the State of South Carolina or Georgia so that they are taxed and must be transferred
as residential homes rather than vehicles. The Company also obtains a mortgage on the real estate to which such homes are affixed. 

Multi-family:  Multi-family real
estate loans generally have a maximum term of five years with a 30 year amortization period and a final balloon payment and
are secured by properties containing five or more units in the Company's market area. These loans are generally made in amounts
of up to 75% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property with an appropriate projected debt service
coverage ratio. The Company's underwriting analysis includes considering the borrower's expertise and requires verification of
the borrower's credit history, income and financial statements, banking relationships, independent appraisals, references and income
projections for the property. The Company generally obtains personal guarantees on these loans. 

Multi-family real estate loans generally
present a higher level of risk than loans secured by one-to-four family residences. This greater risk is due to several factors,
including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions
on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the
repayment of loans secured by multi-family residential real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the
related real estate project. 

Home Equity:  The Company offers
home equity loans and lines of credit secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary residences in our market area. The Company s
home equity loans and lines of credit are limited to an 80% loan-to-value ratio (including all prior liens). Standard residential
mortgage underwriting requirements are used to evaluate these loans. The Company offers adjustable-rate and fixed-rate options
for these loans with a maximum term of 10 years. The repayment terms on lines of credit are interest only monthly with principle
due at maturity. Home equity loans have a more traditional repayment structure with principal and interest due monthly. The maximum
term on home equity loans is 10 years with an amortization schedule not exceed 20 years. 

Nonresidential Real Estate:  Nonresidential
loans include those secured by real estate mortgages on churches, owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied commercial buildings of
various types, retail and office buildings, hotels, and other business and industrial properties. The nonresidential real estate
loans that the Company originates generally have terms of five to 20 years with amortization periods up to 20 years.
The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our nonresidential real estate loans is generally 75%.

Loans secured by nonresidential real estate
generally are larger than one-to-four family residential loans and involve greater credit risk. Nonresidential real estate loans
often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment of these loans depends to a large
degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property,
and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general, including the
current adverse conditions. In addition, because a church's financial stability often depends on donations from congregation members
rather than income from business operations, repayment may be affected by economic conditions that affect individuals located both
in our market area and in other market areas with which we are not as familiar. In addition, due to the unique nature of church
buildings and properties, the real estate securing church loans may be less marketable than other nonresidential real estate. 

The Company considers a number of factors in originating
nonresidential real estate loans. The Company evaluates the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit
history, cash flows, the applicable business plan, the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower's experience in owning
or managing similar property and the borrower's payment history with the Company and other financial institutions. In evaluating
the property securing the loan, the factors the Company considers include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before
debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service
coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). For church loans, the Company also considers the length of
time the church has been in existence, the size and financial strength of the denomination with which it is affiliated, attendance
figures and growth projections and current operating budgets. The collateral underlying all nonresidential real estate loans is
appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by our board of directors. Personal guarantees may be obtained from the principals
of nonresidential real estate borrowers, and in the case of church loans, guarantees from the applicable denomination may be obtained.

Agricultural:  These loans are secured
by farmland and related improvements in the Company s market area. These loans generally have terms of five to 20 years with
amortization periods up to 20 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of these loans is generally 75%. The Company is managing a
small number of these loans in our portfolio. We continue to closely monitor our existing relationships. 

Loans secured by agricultural real estate
generally are larger than one-to-four family residential loans and involve greater credit risk. Agricultural real estate loans
often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment of these loans depends to a large
degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property,
and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general, including the
current adverse conditions. 

Construction and Land:  The Company
makes construction loans to individuals for the construction of their primary residences and to commercial businesses for their
real estate needs. These loans generally have maximum terms of twelve months, and upon completion of construction convert to conventional
amortizing mortgage loans. Residential construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one-to-four family residential mortgage
loans that the Company originates. Commercial construction loans have rate and terms comparable to commercial loans that we originate.
During the construction phase, the borrower generally pays interest only. Generally, the maximum loan-to-value ratio of our owner-occupied
construction loans is 80%. Residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating
permanent residential mortgage loans. Commercial construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines
used for originating commercial loans. 

The Company also makes interim construction
loans for nonresidential properties. In addition, the Company occasionally makes loans for the construction of homes  on speculation, 
but the Company generally permits a borrower to have only two such loans at a time. These loans generally have a maximum term of
eight months, and upon completion of construction convert to conventional amortizing nonresidential real estate loans. These construction
loans have rates and terms comparable to permanent loans secured by property of the type being constructed that we originate. Generally,
the maximum loan-to-value ratio of these construction loans is 85%.

Commercial and Industrial Loans:  
Commercial and industrial loans are offered to businesses and professionals in the Company s market area. These loans generally
have short and medium terms on both a collateralized and uncollateralized basis. The structure of these loans are largely determined
by the loan purpose and collateral. Sources of collateral can include a lien on furniture, fixtures, equipment, inventory, receivables
and other assets of the company. A UCC-1 is typically filed to perfect our lien on these assets. 

Commercial and industrial loans and leases
typically are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s or lessee s ability to make repayment from the cash flow
of its business and generally are collateralized by business assets. As a result, such loans and leases involve additional complexities,
variables and risks and require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans and leases. 

Consumer and Other Loans:  The Company
offers installment loans for various consumer purposes, including the purchase of automobiles, boats, and for other legitimate
personal purposes. The maximum terms of consumer loans is 18 months for unsecured loans and 18 to 60 months for loans
secured by a vehicle, depending on the age of the vehicle. The Company generally only extends consumer loans to existing customers
or their immediate family members, and these loans generally have relatively low balances. 

Consumer loans may entail greater credit
risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable
assets, such as automobiles. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability,
and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and
state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. 

Based on the most recent analysis performed,
the risk grade of loans by portfolio segment are presented in the following tables. Separate tables are presented to show the risk
grade of loans that have been acquired.

Total loans by risk grade and portfolio
segment at June 30, 2016: 

At September 30, 2016, consumer mortgage
loans secured by residential real estate properties totaling $683 were in formal foreclosure proceedings and are included in one-to-four
family loans. 

(6)    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

Fair value is the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that
may be used to measure fair values: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical
assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 

Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other
than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect
a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

Investment Securities:  

The fair values for investment securities
are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values
are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar
securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). 

Impaired Loans:   

The fair value of impaired loans with specific
allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize
a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are
routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data
available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair
value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements,
or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the
time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a
Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

 (Amounts in thousands, except share and
per share data) 

Real Estate Owned:   

Assets acquired through or instead of loan
foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets
are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent
real estate appraisals, which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach
or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal
process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments
are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Real estate
owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. 

Appraisals for both collateral-dependent
impaired loans and real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential
appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once
received, management reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value
in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics. On an annual basis, the Company
compares the actual selling price of collateral that has been sold to the most recent appraised value to determine what additional
adjustment should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value. 

Loan Servicing Rights:      

Fair value is determined based on a valuation
model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model utilizes assumptions that
market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income and that can be validated against available market data
and results in a Level 3 classification. 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair
value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 are summarized below:

Presented in the table below are assets
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using level 3 inputs at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016: 

The Company's impaired loans at September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were measured at fair value based primarily upon the estimated value of real estate collateral less
costs to sell. The carrying amounts of these loans were $3,496 and $2,463, respectively, which consisted of valuation allowances
of $207 and $184, respectively. The impact to the provision for loan losses from the change in the valuation allowance for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was an increase of $23 and a decrease of $85, respectively. 

Real estate owned is carried at the lower
of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. The carrying value of real estate owned and their respective valuation allowances
at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were $654 and $1,354 and $141 and $102, respectively. The resulting write-downs for measuring
real estate owned at the lower of carrying or fair value less costs to sell for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, were $103 and $95, respectively.

Many of the Company s assets and
liabilities are short-term financial instruments whose carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet approximate
fair value. These items include cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable and payable balances, variable rate loan
and deposits that re-price frequently and fully. The estimated fair values of the Company s remaining on-balance sheet financial
instruments at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 are summarized below: 

(1)  Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is evaluated on a pool-level basis.  The fair
value of loans held for sale is determined using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan
or other observable market data, such as outstanding commitments from third party investors and result in a Level 2 classification.   

(7)    EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN  

Employees participate in an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan ( ESOP ). The ESOP borrowed from the Company to purchase 248,842 shares of the Company s common
stock at $10 per share during 2011. The Company makes discretionary contributions to the ESOP and pays dividends on unallocated
shares to the ESOP, and the ESOP uses funds it receives to repay the loan. When loan payments are made, ESOP shares are allocated
to participants based on relative compensation and expense is recorded. Dividends on allocated shares increase participant accounts.
Participants receive the shares at the end of employment. 

No contributions to the ESOP were made
during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The expense recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
was $92 and $90, respectively.

(8)    STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  

On April 5, 2012, the shareholders of Oconee
Federal Financial Corp. approved the Oconee Federal Financial Corp. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) for employees
and directors of the Company. The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 435,472 shares of the Company s common stock, with
no more than 124,420 of shares as restricted stock awards and 311,052 as stock options, either incentive stock options or non-qualified
stock options. The exercise price of options granted under the Plan may not be less than the fair market value on the date the
stock option is granted. The compensation committee of the board of directors has sole discretion to determine the amount and to
whom equity incentive awards are granted. 

On February 5, 2016, the compensation
committee of the board of directors approved the issuance of 21,000 stock options to purchase Company stock and 7,000 shares of
restricted stock were granted to officers. Stock options and restricted stock have vesting periods of five years or seven
years, a percentage of which vests annually on each anniversary of the grant date. The weighted average vesting period of
stock options and restricted stock granted was 5.7 years and 6.0 years, respectively. Stock options expire ten years after issuance.
Apart from the vesting schedule for both stock options and restricted stock, there are no performance-based conditions or any
other material conditions applicable to the awards issued. 

The following table summarizes stock option
activity for the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

(1)  The intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value and the exercise price.
The current market price was based on the closing price of common stock of $23.99 per share on September 30, 2016.

 (Amounts in thousands, except share and

The fair value for each option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses the following assumptions. The Company
uses the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant to determine the risk-free interest rate. The expected dividend
yield is estimated using the projected annual dividend level and recent stock price of the Company s common stock at the
date of grant. Expected stock volatility is based on historical volatilities of the SNL Financial Index of Thrifts. The expected
life of the options is calculated based on the  simplified  method as provided for under generally accepted accounting
principles. 

The weighted-average fair value of options
granted and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model in the fiscal years granted are listed below: 

Stock options are assumed to be earned
ratably over their respective vesting periods and charged to compensation expense based upon their grant date fair value and the
number of options assumed to be earned. There were 11,875 and 10,829 options that were earned during the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was $14 and $12, respectively. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was $111 at September 30,
2016 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years. 

The following table summarizes non-vested
restricted stock activity for the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

The fair value of the restricted stock
awards is amortized to compensation expense over their respective vesting periods and is based on the market price of the Company s
common stock at the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares granted that are expected to vest. The weighted-average grant
date fair value of restricted stock granted on January 23, 2015 was $20.01 per share or $252. The weighted-average grant date fair
value of restricted stock granted on February 5, 2016 was $19.40 per share or $136. Stock-based compensation expense for restricted
stock included in noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $62 and $63, respectively. Unrecognized
compensation expense for nonvested restricted stock awards was $486 at September 30, 2016 and is expected to be recognized over
a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.

Activity for loan servicing rights for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Fair value at September 30, 2016 was determined
using a discount rate of 9.00%, prepayment speed assumptions ranging from 9.2% to 18.9% Conditional Prepayment Rate ( CPR )
depending on the loans coupon, term and seasoning, and a weighted average default rate of 0.61%.  Fair value at September
30, 2015 was determined using a discount rate of 9.50%, prepayment speed assumptions ranging from 7.0% to 19.8% CPR depending on
the loans  coupon, term and seasoning, and a weighted average default rate of 0.61%.

The following factors, among others, could
cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 

our ability to manage our operations under the current adverse economic conditions (including real estate values, loan demand,
inflation, commodity prices and employment levels) nationally and in our market areas;   

adverse changes in the financial industry, securities, credit and national and local real estate markets (including real estate
values);   

significant increases in our delinquencies and loan losses, including as a result of our inability to resolve classified assets,
changes in the underlying cash flows of our borrowers, and management s assumptions in determining the adequacy of the allowance
for loan losses;   

credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and trend of loan delinquencies and write-offs and in our
allowance and provision for loan losses;   

use of estimates for determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which may prove to be incorrect and result in significant
declines in valuations;   

increased competition among depository and other financial institutions;   

our ability to attract and maintain deposits, including introducing new deposit products;   

changes in interest rates generally, including changes in the relative differences between short term and long term interest
rates and in deposit interest rates, that may affect our net interest margin and funding sources;   

fluctuations in the demand for loans, which may be affected by the number of unsold homes, land and other properties in our
market areas and by declines in the value of real estate in our market area;   

declines in the yield on our assets resulting from the current low interest rate environment;   

our ability to successfully implement our business strategies, including attracting and maintaining deposits and introducing
new financial products;   

risks related to high concentration of loans secured by real estate located in our market areas;   

changes in the level of government support of housing finance;   

the results of examinations by our regulators, including the possibility that our regulators may, among other things, require
us to increase our reserve for loan losses, write down assets, change our regulatory capital position, limit our ability to borrow
funds or maintain or increase deposits, or prohibit us from paying dividends, which could adversely affect our dividends and earnings;   

Table of Contents   

our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;   

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, which could
result in, among other things, increased deposit insurance premiums and assessments, capital requirements (particularly the new
capital regulations), regulatory fees and compliance costs and the resources we have available to address such changes;   

technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected;   

our reliance on a small executive staff;   

changes in our compensation and benefit plans, and our ability to retain key members of our senior management team and to address
staffing needs to implement our strategic plan;   

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;   

changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;   

our ability to control costs and expenses, particularly those related to operating as a publicly traded company;   

other changes in our financial condition or results of operations that reduce capital available to pay dividends;   

other changes in the financial condition or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own, including our stock in the
FHLB of Atlanta; and   

other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and operational factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and
services.   

Because of these and a wide variety of
other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking
statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

There are no material changes to the critical
accounting policies disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for Oconee Federal Financial Corp. for the year ended June 30,
2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2016   

Our total assets decreased by $1.4 million,
or 0.3%, to $484.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $485.6 million at June 30, 2016. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased
$4.8 million, or 17.4%, to $22.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $27.7 million at June 30, 2016. Excess cash was used to fund
loan growth. Gross loans increased $3.4 million, or 1.2%, to $295.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $292.1 million at June 30,
2016. This increase is a result of increased loan demand experienced during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Deposits decreased $1.2 million, or 0.3%,
to $398.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $399.6 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in our deposits reflected a decrease
of $6.4 million in certificates of deposit and $759 thousand in savings deposits, offset by an increase in money market and NOW
and demand deposits of $5.9 million. The increase in money market deposits is reflective of an increase in rate on certain money
market accounts during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We believe the decline in our certificates of deposit is reflective
of depositors moving their deposits into higher yielding investments in the market. 

Oconee Federal, MHC s cash is held
on deposit with the Company. We generally do not accept brokered deposits and no brokered deposits were accepted during the three
months ended September 30, 2016. 

Table of Contents   

We had no advances from the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Atlanta as of September 30, 2016 or June 30, 2016. We have credit available under a loan agreement with the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Atlanta in the amount of 25% of our qualified one-four family loans as of September 30, 2016, or approximately
$121.6 million. 

Total shareholders  equity decreased
$219 thousand, or 0.3%, to $85.2 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $85.4 million at June 30, 2016. Net income of $1.3
million and stock compensation and ESOP expenses of $76 thousand and $92 thousand, respectively, were offset by dividends
paid, increases in other comprehensive loss, and share repurchases of $583 thousand, $376 thousand, and $701 thousand, respectively,
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company and the Bank exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements for
the period. 

Table of Contents   

Nonperforming Assets   

The table below sets forth the amounts
and categories of our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. 

Interest income that would have been recorded
had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $67 thousand and $37 thousand for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest of $10 thousand and $5 thousand, respectively, was recognized
on these loans and is included in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Table of Contents   

Interest income that would have been recorded
had our trouble debt restructured loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $33 thousand for the three months
ended September 30, 2016. No interest was recognized on trouble debt restructured loans for the three months ended September 30,
2015. 

Nonperforming assets increased $479 thousand
from June 30, 2016 to September 30, 2016. Nonaccrual loans increased $1.2 million while real estate owned decreased $700 thousand.
There were no loans past due 90 days or more for either period. The increase in nonaccrual loans primarily related to an increase
in our TDRs as we continue to work with borrowers to avoid foreclosure. Nonperforming assets to total assets and nonperforming
assets to loans and real estate owned were 1.15% and 1.88%, respectively, at September 30, 2016 compared to 1.05% and 1.73%, respectively
at June 30, 2016. 

Table of Contents   

Analysis of Net Interest Margin   

The following table sets forth average
balance sheets, average annualized yields and rates, and certain other information at and for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent
yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual
loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield.
The yields set forth below include the effect of net deferred costs, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to income.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   

General.   We reported
net income of $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.4 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Interest income increased $22 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 while interest expense increased
$32 thousand resulting in a net decrease to net interest income of $10 thousand. Noninterest income decreased $622 thousand for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 due to a reduction in gains recognized on the disposition
of PCI loans. Total noninterest expense decreased $213 thousand as a result of decreased foreclosed asset expenses. 

Interest Income.   Interest
income increased by $22 thousand, or 0.5%, to $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The yield on interest
earning-assets decreased eight basis points from 4.04% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 3.96% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was slightly offset by an increase in total average interest-earning assets of $10.5
million to $444.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $433.6 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

Interest income on loans was $3.7 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Although
the yield on loans increased seven basis points from 5.07% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 5.14% for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, the average balance of loans decreased by $15.4 million, or 5.0%, to $291.0 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $306.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the
average balance of our loans is reflective of the run off in the months following the acquisition of Stephens Federal Bank
in December 2014. As a result of the acquisition, we obtained loans with slightly higher coupon rates from ours, which
had the positive effect of increasing our overall loan portfolio yield. 

Interest income on investment securities
increased by $143 thousand, or 29.9%, to $621 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $478 thousand for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase reflected an increase in the average balance of securities of $17.6 million,
or 15.7%, to $129.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $111.9 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015 and an increase of 21 basis points in the yield on securities to 1.92% from 1.71%. The increase in the average balances
of our investment securities is reflective of our efforts to continue to invest in high-quality investment securities during this
period of low loan demand. The increase in the yield on our investment securities is reflective of our efforts to shift our portfolio
concentration to investments in municipal securities, which give us slightly higher yields and in some cases provide tax-exempt
income. 

Interest Expense.   Interest
expense increased by $32 thousand, or 11.1%, to $320 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $288 thousand
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase reflected an increase of two basis points in the average rate paid
on deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to 0.34% from 0.32% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase in the average rate paid on deposits is reflective of our efforts to keep our cost of funds as low as possible but still
maintain our competitiveness in our market area among other banking institutions. Average interest-bearing deposits were $376.7
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $366.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

The largest increase in interest expense
related to expense on money market deposits, which increased $64 thousand, or 106.7%, to $70 thousand for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $6 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Average money market deposit balances increased
$55.7 million from $17.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $73.3 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016. The increases resulted from a successful money market campaign during the year ended June 30, 2016. 

The average rate paid on certificates of
deposit remained flat at 0.41% for the periods while average balances decreased from $250.7 million for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2015 to $225.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016. Lower volume resulted in a decrease
in interest expense of $25 thousand for certificates of deposit. 

The average balance of NOW and demand
deposits decreased slightly by $132 thousand while the average rate decreased four basis points and the average
balance of savings deposits decreased $20.2 million while average rates increased four basis points. 

Net Interest Income.   Net
interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased by $10 thousand, or 0.2%, to $4.1 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016. Our interest rate spread and net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to
3.62% and 3.67%, respectively, from 3.72% and 3.77%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. While yields
on each type of interest-earning asset increased, average loan volume, which has the highest yield, decreased by $15.4 million,
significantly contributing to the decrease in net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Table of Contents   

Provision for Loan Losses.   We
recorded a provision for loan losses of $65 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $145 thousand
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $15 thousand
compared to $142 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The provision for specific valuation allowances on impaired
loans was increased from $184 thousand at June 30, 2016 to $207 thousand at September 30, 2016. The recorded investment in impaired
loans at September 30, 2016 was $5.8 million compared to $5.4 million at June 30, 2016. Total loans evaluated collectively for
impairment increased $3.0 million, or 1.0% to $290.8 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $287.8
million at June 30, 2016. Approximately $160 thousand of the specific valuation allowance at September 30, 2016
was related to PCI loans compared to $129 thousand at June 30, 2016. Primarily all of the charge-offs for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were related to loans we acquired. 

Our total allowance for loan losses was $972
thousand, or 0.33%, of total gross loans, at September 30, 2016 and $922 thousand, or 0.32% of total gross loans at June 30, 2016.
The ending allowance for specifically identified impaired loans was $207 thousand at September 30, 2016 compared to $184 thousand
at June 30, 2016. The general valuation allowance at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 was $765 thousand and $738 thousand,
respectively. The allowance for specifically identified impaired loans at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 includes an allowance
of $160 thousand and $129 thousand, respectively for PCI loans. No general valuation allowance has been recorded for the acquired
portion of our loan portfolio that was not determined to be PCI. 

To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded
all losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. There have been
no changes to our allowance for loan loss methodology, and even though our policy with respect to identifying loans for individual
impairment analysis does not require a review of every loan, we review all loans adversely classified as substandard or doubtful
for impairment, regardless of size. 

Noninterest Income.   Noninterest
income decreased $622 thousand, or 58.9%, to $435 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.1 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gains on the disposition of PCI loans of $719 thousand were recognized for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $43 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from the successful
liquidation of $37 thousand and $882 thousand of PCI loans, respectively, during the periods. Gains on sales of investment
securities available for sale increased from $9 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $68 thousand for the
three months ended September 30, 2016.  Gains on sales of securities are
largely market driven, as we have no need to sell securities unless a gain will be realized. Income on bank owned life insurance
increased $14 thousand, or 12.5%, to $126 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $112 thousand for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, which is reflective of the purchase of $8.0 million in bank owned life insurance in September
2015.   

Noninterest Expense.   Noninterest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $213 thousand, or 7.7%, to $2.6 million from $2.8 million for
the same period in 2015.  Expenses related to foreclosed assets decreased
from $175 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $2 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
Total expenses related to foreclosed assets were offset by net gains of $79 thousand recognized on sales of foreclosed assets for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. A loss of $69 thousand was recognized on sales of foreclosed assets for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Real estate owned is carried at the lower of its carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell. We
typically do not experience large gains or losses on real estate properties sold.  

When mortgage loans are sold with servicing
retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value. These servicing rights are then measured at each reporting date
and changes are recorded as  change in loan servicing asset  on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive
income. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized an expense for the decrease in the loan servicing asset
of $23 thousand compared to $64 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The fair values of servicing
rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates
and losses. 

Professional and supervisory expenses
decreased $44 thousand and data processing expenses decreased $19 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the same period in 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 we incurred additional expenses related to
the integration of Stephens Federal primarily related to financial services and data processing. 

Income Tax Expense.   Income
tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $615 thousand compared with $785 thousand for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Our effective income tax rate was 32.6% and 35.2% for the same periods, respectively. The decrease
in our effective tax rate is primarily due to a higher volume of tax-free investment securities. 

Table of Contents   

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Our primary sources of funds are deposits
and the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization
of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general
interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive within our
market and to increase core deposit relationships. 

Liquidity management is both a daily and
long-term responsibility of management. We adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of
(i) expected loan demand, (ii) expected deposit flows, (iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and investment
securities, and (iv) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning
overnight deposits, federal funds sold, and short and intermediate-term U.S. Government sponsored agencies and mortgage-backed
securities of short duration. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, we have credit available under
a loan agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta in the amount of 25% of total assets (as of September 30, 2016), or
approximately $121.6 million. 

Common Stock Dividends.  
On August 25, 2016, the Company paid a $0.10 per share cash dividend on its common stock for a total of $583 thousand. 

Equity Compensation Plans.  
During the three months ended September 30, 2016, no shares of restricted stock or stock options were issued to management.

and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation,
the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

During the quarter ended September 30,
2016, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
