FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS  

3Power Energy Group, Inc. (the  Company )
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 18, 2002 under the name ATM Financial Corp. On April 1, 2008, the Company changed
its name from ATM Financial Corp. to Prime Sun Power Inc.  On March 30, 2011, the Company changed its name from Prime
Sun Power Inc. to 3Power Energy Group, Inc. and increased its authorized share capital to 300,000,000 shares. The Company
is in the business of producing renewable generated electrical power and other alternative energies. 

The Company's primary effort is to sell
electricity generated by solar, wind, hydro, biomass and other renewable energy resources and to develop, build and operate power
plants based on these technologies. The core approach of the Company's business is to deliver energy in markets where there is
an inherent energy gap between supply and demand or where there exists long term, stable, government back by financial support
for development of renewable energy. 

On May 13, 2011, pursuant to a Stock Purchase
Agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ), the Company consummated a reverse merger ( Merger ) with Seawind
Energy Limited ( Seawind Energy ), Seawind Services Limited ( Seawind Services , and together with Seawind
Energy, the  Seawind ) and the shareholders of Seawind Energy (the  Seawind Group Shareholders  and together
with the Company, and the Seawind Companies, the  Parties ). The Seawind Companies were formed under the laws of the
United Kingdom. 

In connection with the Merger, the Company
issued 40,000,000 restricted shares of the Company s common stock to the Seawind Group Shareholders (such acquisition
is referred to herein as the  Seawind Acquisition ). 

Upon completion of the Stock Purchase Agreement,
Seawind became 3Power Group, Inc.'s wholly-owned subsidiary. For accounting purposes, the acquisition has been treated as a recapitalization
of Seawind with Seawind as the acquirer (reverse acquisition). The historical financial statements prior to May 13, 2011 are those
of Seawind Energy. The Merger was accounted for as a  reverse merger , since the stockholders of Seawind owned a majority
of the Company s common stock immediately following the transaction and their management has assumed operational, management
and governance control. 

The transaction was accounted for as a
recapitalization of Seawind pursuant to which Seawind was treated as the surviving and continuing entity.  The Company
did not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets in connection with this transaction.  Accordingly, the Company s
historical financial statements are those of Seawind immediately following the consummation of the reverse merger. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the recapitalization. 

In anticipation of the closing of the Stock
Purchase Agreement, the Company changed its name to 3Power Energy Group Inc. and increased its authorized share capital to 300,000,000
shares. 

On July 4, 2011, the Seawind Energy Limited
and Seawind Service Limited changed their name to 3Power Energy Limited and 3Power Project Service Limited, respectively.

On June 5, 2012, the Company and Shala
Energy sh.p.k ( Shala ) executed a master acquisition agreement (the  Acquisition Agreement ) where Shala
agreed to transfer and the Company agreed to acquire 75% of the equity of Shala. Under the Acquisition Agreement (the  Acquisition ),

Shala s partners with respect to their shares in Shala and upon the Company s payment of the first year premium for

River Concession Agreement, in the amount of 7,230,315 Euro (the  Required Insurance Bond Premium ). Shala is a firm
specializing in developing hydro-electric projects, owning and operating sustainable energy projects in the hydro, wind and solar
power sectors in Albania. 

On August 10, 2012, after the conclusion
of the due diligence efforts, the Company made the first year payment of required Insurance Bond Premium in the amount of 164,851
Euro ($211,972), and as such the Acquisition closed. The acquisition resulted in the Company acquiring 75% of the interest in a
hydro-electrical project of a total installed power of 127.6 MW of Shala River in Albania.  The Shala River project finalization
is in process with the Ministry of Albania. 

In connection the acquisition of Shala,
the Company is obligated for an aggregate of 4% of the total project costs as facilitator fees in either cash or the Company's
common stock to Capital Trust Holding AG, as advisor for the Shala acquisition transaction. During the year ended March 31, 2013,
the Company accrued $600,000 due to the facilitator fees for feasibility studies in process and recorded as expenses. In December
2013, the Company issued to Capital Trust Holding AG and its affiliates, 15,000,000 shares of its common stock, valued at
$0.04 per share in settlement of the facilitator fees for feasibility studies.

a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company s Subsidiary, 3Power Energy Limited. 

By the letter of The Insolvency Service
dated October 12, 2012, the Company was required to provide information relating to 3Power Project Services Limited to the Official
Receiver s Office (a government body of Plymouth, the United Kingdom) and attend an interview with staff of the Official
Receiver s Office to review the prospect of recovering the assets of 3Power Project Services Limited for the benefit of creditors.

or control. The Company has attended the interview and delivered all the available accounting records to the Officer Receiver s
Office. No order confirming a plan of reorganization, arrangement or liquidation has been entered as of this filing.

NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Interim Financial Statements  

The following (a) condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of March 31, 2016, which has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements, and (b) the unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q
and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete
financial statements. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for
the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending
March 31, 2017. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended March 31, 2016 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on July 14, 2016. 

Basis of presentation:  

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and it s wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605-10 ) which requires that four
basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has
occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria
(3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and
the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other
adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. 

ASC 605-10 incorporates Accounting Standards
Codification subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arraignments ( ASC 605-25 ). ASC 605-25 addresses accounting for arrangements
that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The effect of implementing
605-25 on the Company's financial position and results of operations was not significant. 

Use of estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)  

The Company applies Statement of Accounting
Standards Codification subtopic 220-10, Comprehensive Income ( ASC 220-10 ). ASC 220-10 establishes standards for the
reporting and displaying of comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of
a business during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owners sources. It includes all changes
in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. ASC 220-10 requires other
comprehensive income (loss) to include foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available for
sale securities. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

For purposes of the Statements of Cash
Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. 

Functional currency  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars ( USD ). The Company's functional currencies are British pounds ( GBP )
and Albania Lek ( LEK ). The consolidated financial statements are translated into USD in accordance with Codification
ASC 830,  Foreign Currency Matters . All assets and liabilities were translated at the current exchange rate, at respective
balance sheet dates, shareholders' equity is translated at the historical rates and income statement items are translated at the
average exchange rate for the reporting periods. The resulting translation adjustments are reported as other comprehensive income
(loss) and accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders' equity in accordance with Codification ASC 220, 

Comprehensive Income . 

Translation gains and losses that arise
from exchange rate fluctuations from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are translated into
GBP at the rate on the date of the transaction and included in the results of operations as incurred. There were no material transaction
gains or losses in the periods presented. 

The exchange rates used to translate amounts
in GBP and LEK into USD for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements were as follows:

Per share data:  

The Company accounts for net loss per share
in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260-10 ), which requires
presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) on the face of the statement of operations for all entities
with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to
the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS. 

Basic and diluted net loss per common share
is calculated by dividing net loss, by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock, adjusted to give effect
to the exchange ratio in the Merger in May 2011 (see Note 1), which was accounted for as recapitalization of the Company. The Company
had no common stock equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Income taxes  

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carry forwards and temporary differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted
tax rates. The Company records an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than
not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized. 

The Company recognizes a tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities,
based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a
position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits. 

Segment Information  

Accounting Standards Codification subtopic
Segment Reporting 280-10 ( ASC 280-10 ) establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments
in annual financial statements and requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports
issued to stockholders. ASC 280-10 also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services and geographic
areas. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is
available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions how to allocate resources
and assess performance. The information disclosed herein materially represents all of the financial information related to the
Company s principal operating segment. 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company accounts for stock, stock options
and warrants using the fair value method promulgated by Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity ( ASC 480-10 ) which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services. Therefore, results include non-cash compensation expense as a result of the issuance of stock,
stock options and warrants and we expect to record additional non-cash compensation expense in the future. 

The Company follows Accounting Standards
Codification subtopic 718-10, Compensation ( ASC 718-10 ) which requires that all share-based payments to both employees
and non-employees be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

There were various updates recently issued
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application
to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. 

NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN MATTERS  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern.  As of
September 30, 2016, the Company has accumulated deficit of $18,984,151 applicable to controlling interest as compared with
a deficit of $18,635,088 applicable to controlling interest as of March 31, 2016, and has incurred significant operating
losses and negative cash flows. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sustained a net loss of $349,063 compared
to a net loss of $559,146 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The Company will need additional financing which may
take the form of equity or debt and the Company has converted certain liabilities into equity. In the event the Company are not
able to increase its working capital, the Company will not be able to implement or may be required to delay all or part of its
business plan, and their ability to attain profitable operations, generate positive cash flows from operating and investing activities
and materially expand the business will be materially adversely affected. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue in existence. 

NOTE 4   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

Property and equipment as of September 30, 2016 and March 31,
2016 summarized as follows: 

Property and equipment are recorded on
the basis of cost. For financial statement purposes, property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method
over their estimated useful lives. 

Expenditures for repair and maintenance
which do not materially extend the useful lives of property and equipment are charged to operations. When property or equipment
is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts with the
resulting gain or loss reflected in operations. Management periodically reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment
for impairment in accordance with the guidance for impairment of long lived assets. 

During the three and six months ended September
30, 2016, the Company charged to operations depreciation expense of $997 and $1,984, respectively, and $1,018 and $1,758 for the
three and six months ended September 30, 2015.

Item 2.  
        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

The following discussion provides information
which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition.
The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this  Report. The
following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results
may differ significantly from the results, expectations and plans discussed in these forward-looking statements. 

Overview  

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada
on December 18, 2002, as ATM Financial Corp. 

On May 13, 2011 the Company entered into
a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ) with Seawind Energy Limited ( Seawind Energy )
and its subsidiary Seawind Services Limited ( Seawind services ), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the
issued and outstanding common stock of Seawind Energy, in exchange for the issuance of 40,000,000 restricted shares of the Company s
common stock (such transaction as  Seawind Acquisition ).  The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse
merger and, accordingly, the Company is the legal survivor and Seawind Energy is the accounting survivor. 

For accounting purposes, Seawind Energy
was the surviving entity. The transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization of Seawind Energy pursuant to which Seawind Energy
was treated as the surviving and continuing entity.  The Company did not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets
in connection with this transaction.  Accordingly, the Company s historical financial statements are those of Seawind
Energy immediately following the consummation of the reverse merger. 

In anticipation of the closing of the Stock
Purchase Agreement, on March 30, 2011 the Company changed its name to 3Power Energy Group Inc. and increased its authorized share
capital to 300,000,000 shares.  On July 4, 2011, Seawind Energy and Seawind Service changed their name to 3Power Energy
Limited ( 3Power Energy ) and 3Power Project Service Limited ( 3Power Service ), respectively. Both 3Power
Energy and 3Power Service are inactive as of September 30, 2016. 

The Business  

The principle planned business of the Company
is to sell electricity generated by solar, wind, hydro, biomass and other renewable energy resources and to develop, build and
operate power plants based on these technologies.  The core approach of the Company s planned business is to deliver
energy in markets where there is an inherent energy gap between supply and demand or where there exists long term, stable, government
backed financial support for the development of renewable energy.  The strategic plan of the Company is to develop power plants
and sell electricity in mature and emerging international energy markets at secure rates with the highest potential margins for
return on investment. 

Acquisition of Shala Energy sh .p .k:  

On June 5, 2012, the Company and Shala
Energy sh.p.k ( Shala ) executed a master acquisition agreement (the  Acquisition Agreement ) whereby Shala
agreed to transfer and the Company agreed to acquire 75% of the equity of Shala. Under the Acquisition Agreement (the  Acquisition ),
the closing of the acquisition was subject to the Company s completion and satisfaction of the due diligence on Shala and
Shala s partners with respect to their shares in Shala and upon the Company s payment of the first year premium for
the insurance bond premium issued in favor of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy of Republic of Albania in replacement of
the then existing bank guarantee issued in favor of Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy of Republic of Albania for the Shala
River Concession Agreement, in the amount of 7,230,315 Euro (the  Required Insurance Bond Premium ). Shala is a firm
specializing in developing hydro-electric projects, owning and operating sustainable energy projects in the hydro, wind and solar
power sectors in Albania. 

16   

On August 10, 2012, after the conclusion
of the due diligence efforts, the Company made the first year payment of required Insurance Bond Premium in the amount of 164,851
Euro ($211,972), and as such the Acquisition closed. The Acquisition resulted in the Company acquiring 75% of the interest in a
hydro-electrical project of a total installed power of 127.6 MW of Shala River in Albania.  The Shala River project finalization
is in process with the Ministry of Albania. 

In connection the acquisition of Shala,
the Company is obligated for an aggregate of 4% of the total project costs as facilitator fees in either cash or the Company's
common stock to Capital Trust Holding AG, as advisor for the Shala acquisition transaction. During the year ended March 31, 2013,
the Company accrued $600,000 due to the facilitator fees for feasibility studies in process and recorded as expenses. In December
2013, the Company issued to Capital Trust Holding AG and its affiliates, 15,000,000 shares of its common stock, valued at
$0.04 per share in settlement of the facilitator fees for feasibility studies. 

During the six months ended September 30,
2016, Shala began operations, acquiring assets and incurring costs. As such, this activity is including in our unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations for the current period. 

Current Focus   

We currently have only one project, a hydro-electrical
project of a total installed power of 127.6 MW of Shala River in Albania, and the commercialization of this project is in its infancy.
Our intended markets may not utilize our producible products, and it may not be commercially successful. 

We intend to develop additional projects
but to date, none have proven to be commercially viable or successful. 

Results of Operations For The Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 And 2015  

We had no revenues from operations for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

We incurred operating expenses of $135,360
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $224,944 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
is due to less, consulting fees, travel and other cost in the current period as compared to prior year in addition to depreciation
expense of $997 incurred with our majority owned subsidiary Shala Energy as compared to $1,018 for the same period last year. 

Our interest expense was $47,533 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $42,015 for the same period in 2015. The increase of $5,518 or due primarily
to compounding of interest associated with note obligations. Additionally, we recognized a foreign currency transaction loss of
$5,015 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a loss of $5,734 last year. 

Results of Operations For The Six Months
Ended September 30, 2016 And 2015  

We had no revenues from operations for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

We incurred operating expenses of $285,989
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $501,981 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is due
to less, consulting fees, travel and other cost in the current period as compared to prior year in addition, offset by depreciation
expense of $1,984 incurred with our majority owned subsidiary Shala Energy as compared to $1,758 for the same period last year. 

Our interest expense was $93,325 for the
six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $80,624 for the same period in 2015. The increase of $12,701 or due primarily
to compounding of interest associated with note obligations. Additionally, we recognized a foreign currency transaction gain of
$6,806 during the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a loss of $17,202 last year. 

17   

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our total cash and cash equivalents as
of September 30, 2016 was $1,993 compared to the total cash and cash equivalents of $9,097 as of March 31, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, our total current
assets were $12,861 compared to total current assets $19,954 as of March 31, 2016 and the total current liabilities were $7,583,492
as of September 30, 2016 compared to $7,399,819 as of March 31, 2016. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due increase
in of $181,959 related party debt and in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8,519. 

Net cash used in operating activities was
$7,104 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $42,053 for the six
months ended September 30, 2015. The cash flow used in operating activities consists of $372,508 net loss, with payments on the
Company s behalf by related party of $181,959 and depreciation of $1,984, foreign currency transaction gain of $6,805, an
increase in prepaid and other assets of $11, increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $96,103 and an increase in accrued
interest of $92,174. 

Net cash used in investing activities was
$-0- and $40,859 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash used in 2015 reflects purchases of equipment
by our majority owned subsidiary, Shala Energy. 

Net cash provided by financing activities
was $Nil for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Our pre-operational activities to date
have consumed substantial amounts of cash. Our negative cash flow from operations is expected to continue and accelerate in the
foreseeable future as the Company invests in capital expenditures to commence operations. 

We will need to raise additional capital
to implement our business plan and continue operations for any length of time. We are seeking alternative sources of financing,
through private placement of securities and loans from our shareholders in order for us to maintain our operations. We cannot guarantee
that we will be successful in raising additional cash resources for our operations. 

The independent registered public accounting
firm s report on our March 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K states that our difficulty
in generating sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations and sustain operations raise substantial doubts about our ability to
continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. In consultation with our
Board of Directors, we have identified several accounting principles that we believe are key to the understanding of our financial
statements. These important accounting policies require management s most difficult, subjective judgments. 

18   

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605-10 ) which requires that four
basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has
occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria
(3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and
the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other
adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. 

ASC 605-10 incorporates Accounting Standards
Codification subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arraignments ( ASC 605-25 ). ASC 605-25 addresses accounting for arrangements
that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The effect of implementing
605-25 on the Company's financial position and results of operations was not significant. 

Comprehensive Income (Loss)   

The Company applies Statement of Accounting
Standards Codification subtopic 220-10, Comprehensive Income ( ASC 220-10 ). ASC 220-10 establishes standards for the
reporting and displaying of comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of
a business during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owners sources. It includes all changes
in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. ASC 220-10 requires other
comprehensive income (loss) to include foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available for
sale securities. 

Foreign Currency Translation and
Transactions   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars ( USD ). The functional currency of our subsidiaries is British
pounds ( GBP ) and Albania Lek ( LEK ). The financial statements of subsidiaries are translated into USD
in accordance with the Codification ASC 830,  Foreign Currency Matters .  All assets and liabilities were
translated at the current exchange rate, at respective balance sheet dates, shareholders  equity is translated at the
historical rates and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting periods.  The
resulting translation adjustments are reported as other comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders 
equity in accordance with the Codification ASC 220,  Comprehensive Income.  

Transaction gains and losses that arise
from exchange rate fluctuations from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are translated into
GBP at the rate on the date of the transaction and included in the results of operations as incurred.  There were no
material transaction gains or losses in the periods presented. 

Income taxes   

Income tax provisions or benefits for interim
periods are computed based on the Company s estimated annual effective tax rate. Based on the Company's historical losses
and its expectation of continuation of losses for the foreseeable future, the Company has determined that it is not more likely
than not that deferred tax assets will be realized and, accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance. As the Company anticipates
or anticipated that its net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 would be fully offset by a valuation allowance,
there is no federal or state income tax benefit for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 related to losses incurred
during such periods. 

Off Balance Sheet Transactions  

We do not have any off-balance sheet transactions. 

19   

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

There were various updates recently issued,
most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not
expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Inflation  

We do not believe that inflation has had
a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant
inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure
to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Disclosure of Contractual Obligations  

The Company does not have any significant
contractual obligations which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 

Item 3.  
        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

Smaller reporting companies are not required
to provide the information required by this item. 

Item 4.  
        Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

As of the end of the period covered by
this Report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). In carrying out that evaluation, management
identified a material weakness (as defined in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Standard No. 2) in our disclosure controls
and procedures regarding a lack of adequate personnel and adequate segregation of duties.  Based on management s
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer
has concluded that, as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Our size has prevented us from being able
to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level of supervision and segregation of duties within our internal
control system. Therefore while there are some compensating controls in place, it is difficult to ensure effective segregation
of accounting and financial reporting duties. Management reported a material weakness resulting from the combination of the following
significant deficiencies: 

Lack of segregation of duties in certain accounting and financial reporting processes including the approval and execution of disbursements;   

The Company s corporate governance responsibilities are performed by the Board of Directors; we do not have independent Board of Directors, we do not have an audit committee or compensation committee. Because our Board of Directors only meets periodically throughout the year, several of our corporate governance functions are not performed concurrent (or timely) with the underlying transaction, evaluation, or recordation of the transaction.   

While we strive to segregate duties as
much as practicable, there is an insufficient volume of transactions at this point in time to justify additional full time staff.
We may not be able to fully remediate the material weakness until we increase operations at which time we would expect to hire
more staff. 

20   

Plan for Remediation of Material Weaknesses  

To mitigate the current limited resources
and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of legal and accounting
professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees and engage outsourced accounting professionals, which
will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework. We will continue to monitor and
assess the costs and benefits of additional staffing. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

No changes were made to our internal control
over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  
        Legal Proceedings   

On November 14, 2012, CRG Finance AG ( CRG ) filed
a complaint in the District Court for Southern District of New York for allegedly beaching a promissory note (See Note 5 above). 

On January 17, 2013, the Company filed
a motion to compel arbitration and on May 23, 2013, the Court granted the Company s Motion to Compel and ordered that CRG
file its claims as an AAA arbitration.

The AAA Arbitrator entered an award of Euro 470,000 plus interest at the annual rate of 7.5% against the Company. As of March 31,
2014, the total award against the Company is Euro 728,241 ($816,795). On or about April 4, 2014, in an effort to perfect this award
against the Company, CRG filed a petition with the Southern District of New York seeking to confirm the award. In addition, the
Company accrued total of $56,835 as reimbursement of attorney fees and cost incurred by CRG and $15,500 as administrative fees
