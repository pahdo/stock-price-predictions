  1. Organization and Basis of Presentation 
  Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P., or ROP, commenced operations on June 2, 1995. The sole general partner of ROP is Wyoming Acquisition GP LLC., or WAGP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P., or the Operating Partnership. The sole limited partner of ROP is the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership is   95.71%   owned by SL Green Realty Corp., or SL Green, as of   September 30, 2016  . SL Green is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, and is the sole managing general partner of the Operating Partnership. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" means ROP and all entities owned or controlled by ROP. 
  ROP is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management and operation of commercial and residential real estate properties, principally office properties, and also owns land for future development, located in New York City, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey, which collectively is also known as the New York Metropolitan area. 
  In 2015, SL Green transferred   two   properties and SL Green's tenancy in common interest in a fee interest with a total value of   $395.0 million   to ROP.  Additionally, in 2015, SL Green transferred   one   entity that held debt investments and financing receivables with an aggregate carrying value of   $1.7 billion   to ROP. These transfers were made to further diversify ROP's portfolio. Under the business combinations guidance (Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, 805-50), these transfers were determined to be transfers of businesses between the indirect parent company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. As such, the assets and liabilities of the properties were transferred at their carrying values and were recorded as of the beginning of the current reporting period as though the assets and liabilities had been transferred at that date. The financial statements and financial information presented for all prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned the following interests in properties in the New York Metropolitan area, primarily in midtown Manhattan. Our investments in the New York Metropolitan area also include investments in Brooklyn, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey, which are collectively known as the Suburban properties: 

(1) 
    The weighted average occupancy for commercial properties represents the total leased square feet divided by total acquisition square footage. The weighted average occupancy for residential properties represents the total occupied units divided by total available units. 
              (2) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a building that was comprised of approximately   270,132   square feet of retail space and approximately   222,855   square feet of residential space. For the purpose of this report, we have included the building in the retail properties count and have bifurcated the square footage into the retail and residential components. 
        
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held debt and preferred equity investments with a book value of   $1.8 billion  , including   $0.3 billion   of debt and preferred equity investments and other financing receivables that are included in other balance sheet line items.  
  Basis of Quarterly Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally

accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position of the Company at   September 30, 2016   and the results of operations for the periods presented have been included. The operating results for the period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date but do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principals generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. 
   
  2. Significant Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries, which are wholly-owned or controlled by us. Entities which we do not control through our voting interest and entities which are variable interest entities, but where we are not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for under the equity method. See Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments." ROP's investments in majority-owned and controlled real estate joint ventures are reflected in the financial statements on a consolidated basis with a reduction for the noncontrolling partners' interests. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  
  We consolidate a variable interest entity, or VIE, in which we are considered the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Included in commercial real estate properties on our consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are   $1.4 billion   and   $0.3 billion  , respectively, related to our consolidated VIEs. Included in mortgages and other loans payable on our consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are   $493.8 million   and   none  , respectively, collateralized by the real estate assets of the related consolidated VIEs. 
  A noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us. Noncontrolling interests are required to be presented as a separate component of capital in the consolidated balance sheet and the presentation of net income is modified to present earnings and other comprehensive income attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests. 
  We assess the accounting treatment for each joint venture and debt and preferred equity investment. This assessment includes a review of each joint venture or limited liability company agreement to determine which party has what rights and whether those rights are protective or participating. For all VIEs, we review such agreements in order to determine which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. In situations where we and our partner approve, among other things, the annual budget, receive a detailed monthly reporting package, meet on a quarterly basis to review the results of the joint venture, review and approve the joint venture's tax return before filing, and approve all leases that cover more than a nominal amount of space relative to the total rentable space at each property, we do not consolidate the joint venture as we consider these to be substantive participation rights that result in shared power of the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the joint venture. Our joint venture agreements typically contain certain protective rights such as requiring partner approval to sell, finance or refinance the property and the payment of capital expenditures and operating expenditures outside of the approved budget or operating plan. 
  Investment in Commercial Real Estate Properties 
  On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate properties may be other than  temporarily impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the calculated fair value of the property.  
   We also evaluate our real estate properties for potential impairment when a real estate property has been classified as held for sale. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of either their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. We do not believe that there were any indicators of impairment at any of our consolidated properties at   September 30, 2016  . 
  We allocate the purchase price of real estate to land and building (inclusive of tenant improvements) and, if determined to be material, intangibles, such as the value of the above- and below-market leases and origination costs associated with the in-place

leases. We depreciate the amount allocated to building (inclusive of tenant improvements) over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from   three   to   40 years  . We amortize the amount allocated to the above- and below-market leases over the remaining term of the associated lease, which generally range from   one   to   14 years  , and record it as either an increase (in the case of below-market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) to rental income. We amortize the amount allocated to the values associated with in-place leases over the expected term of the associated lease, which generally ranges from   one   to   14 years  . If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off. The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date). We assess fair value of the leases based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. To the extent acquired leases contain fixed rate renewal options that are below-market and determined to be material, we amortize such below-market lease value into rental income over the renewal period. 
  We recognized an increase of   $8.1 million   and   $15.9 million   in rental revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, for the amortization of aggregate below-market leases in excess of above-market leases and a reduction in lease origination costs, resulting from the allocation of the purchase price of the applicable properties. We recognized an increase of   $8.3 million  , and   $20.9 million   in rental revenue for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, for the amortization of aggregate below-market leases in excess of above-market leases and a reduction in lease origination costs, resulting from the allocation of the purchase price of the applicable properties. 
  The following summarizes our identified intangible assets (acquired above-market leases and in-place leases) and intangible liabilities (acquired below-market leases) as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

Fair Value Measurements 
  See Note 12, "Fair Value Measurements." 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  We assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability, and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its fair value. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on the joint ventures' projected discounted cash flows. We do not believe that the values of any of our equity investments were impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
  We may originate loans for real estate acquisition, development and construction, where we expect to receive some or all of the residual profit from such projects. When the risk and rewards of these arrangements are essentially the same as an investor or joint venture partner, we account for these arrangements as real estate investments under the equity method of accounting for investments. Otherwise, we account for these arrangements consistent with our loan accounting for our debt and preferred equity investments. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space. In order for the tenant to take possession, the leased space must be substantially ready for its intended use. To determine whether the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use, management evaluates whether we are or the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes. When management concludes that we are the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.)

  (unaudited) 

possession of the finished space, which is when such tenant improvements are substantially complete. In certain instances, when management concludes that we are not the owner (the tenant is the owner) of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space. When management concludes that we are the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, we record amounts funded to construct the tenant improvements as a capital asset. For these tenant improvements, we record amounts reimbursed by tenants as a reduction of the capital asset. When management concludes that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, we record our contribution towards those improvements as a lease incentive, which is included in deferred costs, net on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in deferred rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. We establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future potential tenant credit losses, which may occur against this account. The balance reflected on the consolidated balance sheets is net of such allowance. 
  In addition to base rent, our tenants also generally will pay their pro rata share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses for the building over a base year. In some leases, in lieu of paying additional rent based upon increases in building operating expenses, the tenant will pay additional rent based upon increases in the wage rate paid to porters over the porters' wage rate in effect during a base year or increases in the consumer price index over the index value in effect during a base year. In addition, many of our leases contain fixed percentage increases over the base rent to cover escalations. Electricity is most often supplied by the landlord either on a sub-metered basis, or rent inclusion basis (i.e., a fixed fee is included in the rent for electricity, which amount may increase based upon increases in electricity rates or increases in electrical usage by the tenant). Base building services other than electricity (such as heat, air conditioning and freight elevator service during business hours, and base building cleaning) are typically provided at no additional cost, with the tenant paying additional rent only for services which exceed base building services or for services which are provided outside normal business hours. These escalations are based on actual expenses incurred in the prior calendar year. If the expenses in the current year are different from those in the prior year, then during the current year, the escalations will be adjusted to reflect the actual expenses for the current year. 
  We record a gain on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer, subject to the buyer's financial commitment being sufficient to provide economic substance to the sale and provided that we have no substantial economic involvement with the buyer. 
  Interest income on debt and preferred equity investments is accrued based on the contractual terms of the instruments and when, in the opinion of management, it is deemed collectible. Some debt and preferred equity investments provide for accrual of interest at specified rates, which differ from current payment terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management's determination that accrued interest is ultimately collectible, based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower. If management cannot make this determination, interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt. 
  Deferred origination fees, original issue discounts and loan origination costs, if any, are recognized as an adjustment to the interest income over the terms of the related investments using the effective interest method. Fees received in connection with loan commitments are also deferred until the loan is funded and are then recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield. Discounts or premiums associated with the purchase of loans are amortized or accreted into interest income as a yield adjustment on the effective interest method based on expected cashflows through the expected maturity date of the related investment. If we purchase a debt or preferred equity investment at a discount, intend to hold it until maturity and expect to recover the full value of the investment, we accrete the discount into income as an adjustment to yield over the term of the investment. If we purchase a debt or preferred equity investment at a discount with the intention of foreclosing on the collateral, we do not accrete the discount. For debt investments acquired at a discount for credit quality, the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows at acquisition is not accreted. Anticipated exit fees, the collection of which is expected, are also recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield. 
  Debt and preferred equity investments are placed on a non-accrual status at the earlier of the date at which payments become   90 days   past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of interest income becomes doubtful. Interest income recognition on any non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment is resumed when such non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. Interest is recorded as income on impaired loans only to the extent cash is received. 
  We may syndicate a portion of the loans that we originate or sell the loans individually. When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, we derecognize the loan sold and recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the loan sold. Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.)

  (unaudited) 

investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of investment income. 
  Reserve for Possible Credit Losses 
  The expense for possible credit losses in connection with debt and preferred equity investments is the charge to earnings to increase the allowance for possible credit losses to the level that we estimate to be adequate, based on Level 3 data, considering delinquencies, loss experience and collateral quality. Other factors considered include geographic trends, product diversification, the size of the portfolio and current economic conditions. Based upon these factors, we establish a provision for possible credit losses on each individual investment. When it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due, the investment is considered impaired. 
  Where impairment is indicated on an investment that is held to maturity, a valuation allowance is measured based upon the excess of the recorded investment amount over the net fair value of the collateral. Any deficiency between the carrying amount of an asset and the calculated value of the collateral is charged to expense. We continue to assess or adjust our estimates based on circumstances of a loan and the underlying collateral. If the additional information obtained reflects increased recovery of our investment, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. There were no loan reserves recorded during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
  Debt and preferred equity investments held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value using available market information obtained through consultation with dealers or other originators of such investments as well as discounted cash flow models based on Level 3 data pursuant to ASC 820-10. As circumstances change, management may conclude not to sell an investment designated as held for sale. In such situations, the investment will be reclassified at its net carrying value to debt and preferred equity investments held to maturity. For these reclassified investments, the difference between the current carrying value and the expected cash to be collected at maturity will be accreted into income over the remaining term of the investment. 
  Income Taxes 
  ROP is a partnership and, as a result, all income and losses of the partnership are allocated to the partners for inclusion in their respective income tax returns. No provision has been made for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements since such taxes, if any, are the responsibility of the individual partners. 
  Shares Contributed by Parent Company 
              We present shares of SL Green common stock as a contra equity account in our financial statements. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash investments, debt and preferred equity investments and accounts receivable. We place our cash investments in excess of insured amounts with high quality financial institutions. The collateral securing our debt and preferred equity investments is located in New York City. See Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments." We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our tenants and require most tenants to provide security deposits or letters of credit. Though these security deposits and letters of credit are insufficient to meet the total value of a tenant's lease obligation, they are a measure of good faith and a source of funds to offset the economic costs associated with lost rent and the costs associated with re-tenanting a space. Although the properties in our real estate portfolio are primarily located in Manhattan, we also have properties located in Brooklyn, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey. The tenants located in our buildings operate in various industries. No tenant in the portfolio accounted for more than   5.0%   of our share of annualized cash rent, including our share of joint venture annualized cash rent, at   September 30, 2016  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   13.3%  ,   12.6%  ,   8.2%  ,   6.5%  ,    6.3%  ,    5.9%  ,    5.7%   and   5.7%   of our share of annualized cash rent was attributable to 919 Third Avenue, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 625 Madison Avenue, 750 Third Avenue, 810 Seventh Avenue, 1350 Avenue of the Americas, 555 West 57   th    Street and 125 Park Avenue respectively. Annualized cash rent for all other consolidated properties was below 5.0%.  
  Reclassification 
  Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to our current year presentation.

Accounting Standards Updates 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The ASU provides final guidance on eight cash flow issues, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, distributions received from equity method investees, separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle, and others. The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The guidance changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income.  The guidance replaces the current  incurred loss  model with an  expected loss  approach. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted after December 2018. The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323). The guidance eliminates the requirement that an entity retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2016 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under the previous standard. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under the previous standard. The Guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 (ASU825-10), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The guidance requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and to record changes in instruments-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured under the fair value option in other comprehensive income. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods therein.  The Company has not yet adopted this new guidance and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued final guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability (ASU 2015-03). The guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2016. Accordingly, as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015,   $24.1 million   and   $25.4 million  , respectively of deferred debt issuance costs, net of amortization are presented as a direct reduction within Mortgages and other loans payable, Revolving credit facility, Term loan and senior unsecured notes on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued guidance that amends the current consolidation guidance, including introducing a separate consolidation analysis specific to limited partnerships and other similar entities (ASU 2015-02). Under this analysis, limited partnerships and other similar entities will be considered a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2016. Under the revised guidance, certain entities, including the Operating Partnership, now qualify as variable interest entities while some of our entities originally classified as variable interest entities no longer meet the criteria.  The change in designation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and did not change the consolidation conclusion on these entities.

In May 2014, the FASB issued a new comprehensive revenue recognition guidance which requires us to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services (ASU 2014-09). The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued implementation guidance which clarifies principal versus agent considerations in reporting revenue gross versus net (ASU 2016-08).  
  In April 2016, the FASB issued implementation guidance which clarifies the identification of performance obligations (ASU 2016-10).  
  In April 2016, the FASB amended its new revenue recognition guidance on identifying performance obligations to allow entities to disregard items that are immaterial and clarify when a good or service is separately identifiable (ASU 2016-10). 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued implementation guidance relating to transition, collectability, noncash consideration and presentation matters (ASU 2016-12). 
  These ASUs are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is  permitted, but not before interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new guidance can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company has not yet adopted this guidance and is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.

We recorded repayments, participations and sales of   $807.2 million   and   $372.1 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, which offset the increases in debt and preferred equity investments. 
            Certain debt investments that were participated out but did not meet the conditions for sale accounting are included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  Debt Investments 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held the following debt investments, with an aggregate weighted average current yield of   9.29%   at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

    Carrying value is net of discounts, premiums, original issue discounts and deferred origination fees. 
              (2) 
    Represents contractual maturity, excluding any unexercised extension options. 
              (3) 
    Carrying value is net of the following amount that was participated out, which is included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of the transfer not meeting the conditions for sale accounting: (a)   $41.3 million  , (b)   $5.0 million  , (c)   $12.0 million  , (d)   $36.3 million  , (e)   $14.5 million  , (f)   $14.6 million  , (g)   $14.1 million  , and (h)   $5.1 million  .  
              (4) 
    In September 2014, we acquired a   $26.4 million   mortgage loan at a   $0.2 million   discount and a   $5.7 million   junior mortgage participation at a   $5.7 million   discount. The junior mortgage participation was a nonperforming loan at acquisition and is currently on non-accrual status. 
               (6) 
    In April 2016, we closed on an option to acquire a   20%   interest in the underlying asset at a previously agreed upon purchase option valuation, and our mezzanine loan was simultaneously repaid. 
               (8) 
    These loans were collateralized by defeasance securities. 
                   (14) 
    In March 2016, we contributed our interest in the loan in exchange for a joint venture interest which is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting. It is included in unconsolidated joint ventures on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Preferred Equity Investments 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we held the following preferred equity investments with an aggregate weighted average current yield of   7.32%   at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Carrying value is net of deferred origination fees. 
     At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, all debt and preferred equity investments were performing in accordance with the terms of the relevant investments, with the exception of a junior mortgage participation acquired in September 2014, which has a carrying value of   zero  . 
  We have determined that we have   one   portfolio segment of financing receivables at   September 30, 2016   and 2015 comprising commercial real estate which is primarily recorded in debt and preferred equity investments. Included in other assets is an additional amount of financing receivables totaling   $149.6 million   and   $168.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.   No   financing receivables were 90 days past due at   September 30, 2016  .

6. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  We have investments in several real estate joint ventures with various partners. As of   September 30, 2016   none of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are VIEs. The table below provides general information on each of our joint ventures as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Acquisition price represents the actual or implied gross purchase price for the joint venture, which is not adjusted for subsequent acquisitions of additional interests. 
              (2) 
    The joint venture owns   two   mezzanine notes secured by interests in the entity that owns 76 11th Avenue. The difference between our ownership interest and our economic interest results from our right to   50%   of the total exit fee while each of our partners is entitled to receive   25%   of the total exit fee. 
     Acquisition, Development and Construction Arrangement 
  Based on the characteristics of the following arrangements, which are similar to those of an investment, combined with the expected residual profit of not greater than   50%  , we have accounted for these debt and preferred equity investments under the equity method. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value for acquisition, development and construction arrangements were as follows (in thousands): 

(1) 
    The Company has the ability to convert this loan into an equity position starting in 2021 and the borrower is able to force this conversion in 2024. 
     Sale of Joint Venture Interest or Property 
  We did not sell any joint venture interest or property during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Mortgages and Other Loans Payable 
  We generally finance our joint ventures with non-recourse debt. However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leases for tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. The first mortgage notes and other loans payable collateralized by the respective joint venture properties and assignment of leases at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are as follows (amounts in thousands): 

(1) 
    Effective weighted average interest rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , taking into account interest rate hedges in effect during the period.

7. Mortgages and Other Loans Payable 
  The first mortgages and other loans payable collateralized by the respective properties and assignment of leases or debt investments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were as follows (amounts in thousands): 

(1) 
    Effective weighted average interest rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    We own a   51.0%   controlling interest in the joint venture that is the borrower on this loan. 
     Master Repurchase Agreement 
  The Master Repurchase Agreement, or MRA, provides us with the ability to sell certain debt investments with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same at a certain date or on demand. This MRA has a maximum facility capacity of   $300.0 million   and bears interest ranging from   225   and   400   basis points over 30-day LIBOR depending on the pledged collateral. Since December 6, 2015, we have been required to pay monthly in arrears a   25   basis point fee on the excess of   $150.0 million   over the average daily balance during the period if the average daily balance is less than   $150.0 million  . We seek to mitigate risks associated with our repurchase agreement by managing the credit quality of our assets, early repayments, interest rate volatility, liquidity, and market value. The margin call provisions under our repurchase facility permit valuation adjustments based on capital markets activity, and are not limited to collateral-specific credit marks. To monitor credit risk associated with our debt investments, our asset management team regularly reviews our investment portfolio and is in contact with our borrowers in order to monitor the collateral and enforce our rights as necessary. The risk associated with potential margin calls is further mitigated by our ability to recollateralize the facility with additional assets from our portfolio of debt investments, our ability to satisfy margin calls with cash or cash equivalents and access to additional liquidity through the 2012 credit facility, as defined below. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the gross book value of the properties and debt and preferred equity investments collateralizing the mortgages and other loans payable, not including assets held for sale, was approximately   $1.6 billion   and   $2.0 billion  , respectively. 
   
  8. Corporate Indebtedness 
  2012 Credit Facility 
  In August 2016, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility that was originally entered into by the Company in November 2012, referred to as the 2012 credit facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2012 credit facility, as amended, consisted of a   $1.6 billion   revolving credit facility and a   $1.2 billion   term loan, with a maturity date of March 29, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The revolving credit facility has an as-of-right extension to March 29, 2020. We also have an option, subject to customary conditions, to increase the capacity under the revolving credit facility to   $3.0 billion   at any time prior to the maturity date for the revolving credit facility without the consent of existing lenders, by obtaining additional commitments from our existing lenders and other financial institutions.    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2012 credit facility bore interest at a spread over LIBOR ranging from (i)   87.5   basis points to   155   basis points for loans under the revolving credit facility and (ii)   95   basis points to   190   basis points for loans under the term loan facility, in each case based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of ROP. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the applicable spread was   125   basis points for the revolving credit facility and   140   basis points for the term loan facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the effective interest rate was   1.73%   for the revolving credit facility and   1.90%   for the term loan facility. We are required to pay quarterly in arrears a   12.5   to   30   basis point facility fee on the total commitments under the revolving credit facility based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of ROP. As of   September 30, 2016  , the facility fee was   25   basis points.

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $56.5 million   of outstanding letters of credit,   zero   drawn under the revolving credit facility and   $1.2 billion   outstanding under the term loan facility, with total undrawn capacity of   $1.5 billion   under the 2012 credit facility. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the revolving credit facility had a carrying value of   $(6.9) million  , representing deferred financing costs presented within other liabilities, and   $985.1 million  , respectively, net of deferred financing costs. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the term loan facility had a carrying value of   $1.2 billion   and   $929.5 million  , respectively, net of deferred financing costs. 
  We, SL Green and the Operating Partnership are all borrowers jointly and severally obligated under the 2012 credit facility. None of SL Green's other subsidiaries are obligors under the 2012 credit facility. 
  The 2012 credit facility includes certain restrictions and covenants (see Restrictive Covenants below). 
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
  The following table sets forth our senior unsecured notes and other related disclosures as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, by scheduled maturity date (dollars in thousands): 

(1) 
    Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually with principal and unpaid interest due on the scheduled maturity dates. 
              (2) 
    Issued by SL Green, the Operating Partnership and ROP, as co-obligors. 
      ROP also provides a guaranty of the Operating Partnership's obligations under its   3.00%   Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2017. 
  Restrictive Covenants 
  The terms of the 2012 credit facility, as amended, and certain of our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit, among other things, SL Green's ability to pay dividends, make certain types of investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and dispose of assets, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value, a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges, a maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value. The dividend restriction referred to above provides that SL Green will not during any time when a default is continuing, make distributions with respect to SL Green's common stock or other equity interests, except to enable SL Green to continue to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. As of   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 
  Principal Maturities 
  Combined aggregate principal maturities of our mortgages and other loans payable, 2012 credit facility and senior unsecured notes as of   September 30, 2016  , including as-of-right extension options and put options, were as follows (in thousands):

Consolidated interest expense, excluding capitalized interest, was comprised of the following (in thousands): 

9. Related Party Transactions 
  Cleaning/ Security/ Messenger and Restoration Services 
  Alliance Building Services, or Alliance, and its affiliates are partially owned by Gary Green, a son of Stephen L. Green, the chairman of SL Green's board of directors, and provide services to certain properties owned by us. Alliance s affiliates include First Quality Maintenance, L.P., or First Quality, Classic Security LLC, Bright Star Couriers LLC and Onyx Restoration Works, and provide cleaning, extermination, security, messenger, and restoration services, respectively. In addition, First Quality has the non-exclusive opportunity to provide cleaning and related services to individual tenants at our properties on a basis separately negotiated with any tenant seeking such additional services. An affiliate of ours has entered into an arrangement with Alliance whereby it will receive a profit participation above a certain threshold for services provided by Alliance to certain tenants at certain buildings above the base services specified in their lease agreements.  
  Income earned from profit participation, which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations, was   $0.8 million   and   $2.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015.     
  We also recorded expenses for these services, inclusive of capitalized expenses, of   $1.2 million   and   $6.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, (excluding services provided directly to tenants), and    $2.7 million   and   $6.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.

10. Preferred Units 
   Through a consolidated subsidiary, we have authorized up to   109,161     3.5%   Series A Preferred Units of limited partnership interest, or the Greene Series A Preferred Units, with a liquidation preference of   $1,000.00   per unit. In August 2015, the Company issued   109,161   Greene Series A Preferred Units in conjunction with an acquisition. The Greene Series A Preferred unitholders receive annual dividends of   $35.00   per unit paid on a quarterly basis and dividends are cumulative, subject to certain provisions. The Greene Series A Preferred Units can be redeemed at any time, at the option of the unitholder, either for cash or are convertible on a one-for-one basis, into the Series B Preferred Units of limited partnership interest, or the Greene Series B Preferred Units. The Greene Series B Preferred Units can be converted at any time, at the option of the unitholder, into a number of common stock equal to   6.71348   shares of SL Green common stock for each Greene Series B Preferred Unit. As of   September 30, 2016  , no Greene Series B Preferred Units have been issued. 
  ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging requires bifurcation of certain embedded derivative instruments, such as conversion features in convertible equity instruments, and their measurement at fair value for accounting purposes. The conversion feature embedded in the Greene Series A Preferred Units was evaluated, and it was determined that the conversion feature should be bifurcated from its host instrument and accounted for as a freestanding derivative. The derivative is reported as a derivative liability in accrued interest and other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and is adjusted to its fair value at each reporting date, with a corresponding adjustment to interest expense, net of interest income.  The embedded derivative for the Greene Series A Preferred Units was initially recorded at a fair value of   zero   on July 22, 2015, the date of issuance.  At December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the derivative was adjusted to its fair value of   zero  , with a corresponding adjustment to preferred units and interest expense, net of interest income. At   September 30, 2016   the carrying amount and fair value of the derivative remained at   zero  .  
   
  11. Partners' Capital 
  Since consummation of the Merger on January 25, 2007, the Operating Partnership has owned all the economic interests in ROP either by direct ownership or by indirect ownership through our general partner, which is its wholly-owned subsidiary. 
  Intercompany transactions between SL Green and ROP are generally recorded as contributions and distributions. 
   
  12. Fair Value Measurements 
  We are required to disclose fair value information with regard to our financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets, for which it is practical to estimate fair value. The FASB guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We measure and/or disclose the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on a hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions. This hierarchy consists of three broad levels: Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date; Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are used when little or no market data is available. We follow this hierarchy for our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis. In instances in which the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of the particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
  We determine other than temporary impairment in real estate investments and debt and preferred equity investments, including intangibles, utilizing cash flow projections that apply, among other things, estimated revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates, which are classified as Level 3 inputs. 
  The fair value of derivative instruments is based on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well-recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions, which are classified as Level 2 inputs. 
  The financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, debt and preferred equity investments, mortgages and other loans payable and other secured and unsecured debt. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses reported in our consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments. The fair value of debt and preferred equity investments, which is classified as Level 3, is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. The fair value of borrowings, which is classified as Level 3, is estimated by discounting the contractual cash flows of each debt instrument to their present value using adjusted market interest rates, which is provided by a third-party specialist.

(1) 
    Amounts exclude net deferred financing costs. 
              (2) 
    At   September 30, 2016  , debt and preferred equity investments had an estimated fair value ranging between   $1.5 billion   and   $1.6 billion  . At December 31, 2015, debt and preferred equity investments had an estimated fair value ranging between   $1.7 billion   and   $1.8 billion  . 
     Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments was based on pertinent information available to us as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Although we are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the reasonable fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 
   
  13. Financial Instruments: Derivatives and Hedging 
  In the normal course of business, we use a variety of commonly used derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, caps, collar and floors, to manage, or hedge interest rate risk. We hedge our exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions in addition to anticipated future interest payments on existing debt. We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheets at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedge asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Reported net income and capital may increase or decrease prospectively, depending on future levels of interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows. Currently, all of our designated derivative instruments are effective hedging instruments. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had not designated any interest rate swap agreements on any debt investment. 
  Gains and losses on terminated hedges are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss, and are recognized into earnings over the term of the related senior unsecured notes. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the deferred net losses from these terminated hedges, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to net unrealized loss on derivative instrument, was approximately   $1.7 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively. 
  Over time, the realized and unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in the same periods in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings. We estimate that approximately   $0.4 million   of the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into interest expense within the next 12 months.

  Legal Proceedings 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were not involved in any material litigation nor, to management's knowledge, was any material litigation threatened against us or our portfolio which if adversely determined could have a material adverse impact on us. 
  Guarantees 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, a New York licensed captive insurance company and an affiliate of SL Green, became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY. As a member, Belmont may borrow funds from the FHLBNY in the form of secured advances. Belmont s membership will terminate in February 2017 at which point Belmont will be required to repay all funds borrowed. As of   September 30, 2016  , certain commercial real estate properties and debt and preferred equity investments of the Company were pledged as collateral to secure advances under the FHLBNY facility. If Belmont or SL Green are unable to repay the advances upon the termination of Belmont s membership, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the secured advances is   $229.0 million  . The Company incurred approximately   $4.1 million   of costs in conjunction with pledging assets as collateral under the FHLBNY. These costs were reimbursed to the Company by Belmont. 
  Environmental Matters 
  The Company believes that its properties are in compliance in all material respects with applicable Federal, state and local ordinances and regulations regarding environmental issues. Management is not aware of any environmental liability that it believes would have a materially adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Management is unaware of any instances in which it would incur significant environmental cost if any of our properties were sold.

15. Segment Information 
  We are engaged in all aspects of property ownership and management including investment, leasing, operations, capital improvements, development, redevelopment, financing, construction and maintenance in the New York Metropolitan area and have   two   reportable segments, real estate and debt and preferred equity. We evaluate real estate performance and allocate resources based on earnings contribution to income from continuing operations. 
  The primary sources of revenue are generated from tenant rents and escalations and reimbursement revenue. Real estate property operating expenses consist primarily of security, maintenance, utility costs, real estate taxes and ground rent expense (at certain applicable properties). See Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments," for additional details on our debt and  preferred equity investments. 
  Selected results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, and selected asset information as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, regarding our operating segments are as follows (in thousands):

Income from continuing operations represents total revenues less total expenses for the real estate segment and total investment income less allocated interest expense for the debt and preferred equity segment. Interest costs for the debt and preferred equity segment includes actual costs incurred for investments collateralizing the MRA. Interest is imputed on the remaining investments using our 2012 revolving credit facility and corporate borrowing cost. We also allocate loan loss reserves, net of recoveries and transaction related costs to the debt and preferred equity segment.  
  We do not allocate marketing, general and administrative expenses to the debt and preferred equity segment since the use of personnel and resources is dependent on transaction volume between the two segments and varies period over period. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , marketing, general and administrative expenses totaled   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , marketing, general and administrative expenses totaled   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. All other expenses, except interest, relate entirely to the real estate assets.  
  There were no transactions between the above   two   segments.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
  OPERATIONS 
   
  Overview 
  Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P., or ROP, commenced operations on June 2, 1995. The sole general partner of ROP is Wyoming Acquisition GP LLC., or WAGP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P., or the Operating Partnership. The sole limited partner of ROP is the Operating Partnership. SL Green Realty Corp., or SL Green, is the general partner of the Operating Partnership. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" means ROP and all entities owned or controlled by ROP. 
  ROP is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management and operation of commercial and residential real estate properties, principally office properties, and also owns land for future development, located in New York City, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey, which collectively is also known as the New York Metropolitan area. 
  In 2015, SL Green transferred   two   properties and SL Green's tenancy in common interest in a fee interest with a total value of   $395.0 million   to ROP.  Additionally, in 2015, SL Green transferred   one   entity that held debt investments and financing receivables with an aggregate carrying value of   $1.7 billion   to ROP. These transfers were made to further diversify ROP's portfolio. Under the business combinations guidance (Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, 805-50), these transfers were determined to be transfers of businesses between the indirect parent company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. As such, the assets and liabilities of the properties were transferred at their carrying values and were recorded as of the beginning of the current reporting period as though the assets and liabilities had been transferred at that date. The financial statements and financial information presented for all prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned the following interests in properties in the New York Metropolitan area, primarily in midtown Manhattan. Our investments in the New York Metropolitan area also include investments in Brooklyn, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey, which are collectively known as the Suburban properties: 

____________________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    The weighted average occupancy for commercial properties represents the total leased square feet divided by total acquisition square footage. The weighted average occupancy for residential properties represents the total occupied units divided by total available units. 
              (2) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a building that was comprised of approximately   270,132   square feet of retail space and approximately   222,855   square feet of residential space. For the purpose of this report, we have included the building in the retail properties count and have bifurcated the square footage into the retail and residential components. 
              (3) 
    Includes   two   unconsolidated joint venture retail properties at 131-137 Spring Street comprised of approximately   68,342   square feet (unaudited). 
      
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Refer to our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our critical accounting policies, which include investment in commercial real estate properties, investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for possible credit losses and derivative instruments. There have been no changes to these accounting policies during the three months and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Results of Operation 
   
  Comparison of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   to the   three months ended September 30, 2015    
  The following section compares the results of operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Any assets sold or held for sale are excluded from income from continuing operations. 

Rental, Escalation and Reimbursement Revenues 
  Rental revenue increased primarily as a result of increases in rents and occupancy at our same store properties ($6.6 million), the acquisition of 110 Greene Street in July of 2015 ($5.1 million), and increased revenues at 752 Madison Avenue resulting from a lease renewal in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($3.4 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues at 115 Spring Street as a result of the accelerated recognition of non-cash deferred income upon terminating the retail lease at the property in August 2015 ($2.6 million), and the sale of an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($1.0 million). 
  Escalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher operating cost recoveries ($0.9 million), as well as higher real estate tax recoveries (  $0.7 million  ). 
  Occupancy in our Manhattan office operating properties increased to   96.6%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   95.8%   at   September 30, 2015  . Occupancy in our Suburban office operating properties increased to   82.6%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   81.5%   at   September 30, 2015  . 
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

Investment Income 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   investment income increased primarily as a result of additional income recognized from the recapitalization of a debt investment ($41.0 million). This increase was partially offset by lower weighted average yield and balance during the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the weighted average debt and preferred equity investment balance outstanding and weighted average yield were $1.5 billion and 9.4%, respectively, compared to $1.6 billion and 10.1%, respectively, for the same period in 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , the debt and preferred equity investments had a weighted average term to maturity of 1.6 years.  
  Other Income 
  Other income decreased primarily as a result of a     lease buyout received at 125 Park Avenue in 2015 ($1.7 million), and a lease termination fee received at 919 Third Avenue in 2015 ($1.1 million). 
  Property Operating Expenses 
  Property operating expenses increased primarily as a result of higher real estate taxes resulting from higher assessed values and tax rates ($1.9 million). 
  Interest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income 
  Interest expense and amortization of financing costs, net of interest income, decreased primarily as a result of a lower weighted average balance of the 2012 revolving credit facility ($5.6 million). The weighted average consolidated debt balance outstanding was $2.6 billion for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The weighted average interest rate was 3.85% for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of 110 Greene Street in July of 2015 ($6.9 million), partially offset by the sale of an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($1.3 million). 
  Equity in Net Income from Unconsolidated Joint Venture 
  Equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased primarily as a result of the contribution of a debt investment to an unconsolidated joint venture in March 2016 ($1.5 million). 
  Gain on sale of real estate 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street ($101.1 million). 
  Depreciable real estate reserves 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded a $10.0 million charge in connection with the expected sale of one of our properties.

Rental, Escalation and Reimbursement Revenues 
  Rental revenue increased primarily as a result of increases in rents and occupancy at our same store properties ($26.2 million), the acquisition of 110 Greene Street in July 2015 ($10.3 million), and increased rental revenue at 752 Madison Avenue resulting from a lease renewal in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($10.1 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues at 115 Spring Street as a result of the accelerated recognition of non-cash deferred income upon terminating the retail lease at the property in 2015 ($5.4 million), and the sale of 140-150 Grand Street in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($2.4 million). 
  Escalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries ($3.2 million), as well as operating cost recoveries (  $2.0 million  ). 
  Occupancy in our Manhattan office operating properties increased to   96.6%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   95.8%   at   September 30, 2015  . Occupancy in our Suburban office operating properties increased to   82.6%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   81.5%   at   September 30, 2015  .  
  Investment Income 
  Investment income increased primarily as a result of additional income recognized from the recapitalization of a debt investment ($41.0 million). This increase was partially offset by a lower weighted average yield and balance during the first nine months of 2016. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the weighted average debt and preferred equity investment balance outstanding and weighted average yield were $1.5 billion and 9.8%, respectively, compared to $1.6 billion and 10.2%, respectively, for the same period in 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , the debt and preferred equity investments had a weighted average term to maturity of 1.6 years. 
  Property Operating Expenses 
  Property operating expenses increased primarily as a result of higher real estate taxes resulting from higher assessed values and tax rates ($6.7 million). 
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

Interest Expense and Amortization of Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income 
  Interest expense and amortization of financing costs, net of interest income, increased primarily as a result of a higher weighted average balance of the master repurchase agreement ($4.1 million), offset by a lower weighted average balance of the 2012 revolving credit facility (  $2.6 million). The weighted average consolidated debt balance outstanding was $3.1 billion for the     nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The weighted average interest rate was 3.57% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of 110 Greene Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($9.0 million), partially offset by the sale of an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($2.1 million). 
  Equity in Net Income from Unconsolidated Joint Venture 
  Equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased primarily as a result of the contribution of a debt investment to an unconsolidated joint venture in March 2016 ($3.2 million). 
  (Loss) Gain on Sale of Real Estate 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized a loss on the sale of 7 International Drive, Westchester County, NY ($6.9 million). During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street ($101.1 million). 
  Depreciable Real Estate Reserves 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded a $10.0 million charge in connection with the expected sale of one of our properties. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On January 25, 2007, we were acquired by SL Green. See Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources" in SL Green and the Operating Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a complete discussion of additional sources of liquidity available to us due to our indirect ownership by SL Green. 
  We currently expect that our principal sources of funds to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements for working capital and funds for acquisition and development or redevelopment of properties, tenant improvements, leasing costs, repurchases or repayments of outstanding indebtedness (which may include exchangeable debt) and for debt and preferred equity investments will include: 
           (1) 
    cash flow from operations; 
              (2) 
    cash on hand; 
               (4) 
    other forms of secured or unsecured financing; 
              (5) 
    net proceeds from divestitures of properties and redemptions, participations and dispositions of debt and preferred equity investments; and 
              (6) 
    proceeds from debt offerings by us. 
     Cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent, operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating and other costs. Additionally, we believe that our preferred equity investment program will continue to serve as a source of operating cash flow. 
  We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations and SL Green's liquidity are adequate for us to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. 
   
  Cash Flows 
  The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on our consolidated statements of cash flows in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. 
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $66.2 million   and   $45.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, representing a increase of   20.5 million  . The increase was a result of the following changes in cash flows (in thousands):

Our principal source of operating cash flow is related to the leasing and operating of the properties in our portfolio. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and make distributions to SL Green. At   September 30, 2016  , our operating portfolio was   92.7%   occupied. Our debt and preferred investments also provide a steady stream of operating cash flow to us. 
  Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development or redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we received cash primarily for the following investing activities (in thousands): 

Funds spent on capital expenditures, which comprise building and tenant improvements, increased from $  58.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   compared to $  82.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and relates primarily to increased costs incurred in connection with the redevelopment of properties. 
  We generally fund our investment activity through property-level financing, our 2012 credit facility, senior unsecured notes and sale of real estate. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we used cash for the following financing activities (in thousands):

Corporate Indebtedness 
  2012 Credit Facility 
  In August 2016, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility that was originally entered into by the Company in November 2012, referred to as the 2012 credit facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2012 credit facility, as amended, consisted of a   $1.6 billion   revolving credit facility and a   $1.2 billion   term loan, with a maturity date of March 29, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The revolving credit facility has an as-of-right extension to March 29, 2020. We also have an option, subject to customary conditions, to increase the capacity under the revolving credit facility to   $3.0 billion   at any time prior to the maturity date for the revolving credit facility without the consent of existing lenders, by obtaining additional commitments from our existing lenders and other financial institutions.    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2012 credit facility bore interest at a spread over LIBOR ranging from (i)   87.5   basis points to   155   basis points for loans under the revolving credit facility and (ii)   95   basis points to   190   basis points for loans under the term loan facility, in each case based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of ROP. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the applicable spread was   125   basis points for the revolving credit facility and   140   basis points for the term loan facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the effective interest rate was   1.73%   for the revolving credit facility and   1.90%   for the term loan facility. We are required to pay quarterly in arrears a   12.5   to   30   basis point facility fee on the total commitments under the revolving credit facility based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of ROP. As of   September 30, 2016  , the facility fee was   25   basis points. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $56.5 million   of outstanding letters of credit,   zero   drawn under the revolving credit facility and   $1.2 billion   outstanding under the term loan facility, with total undrawn capacity of   $1.5 billion   under the 2012 credit facility. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the revolving credit facility had a carrying value of   $(6.9) million  , representing deferred financing costs presented within other liabilities, and   $985.1 million  , respectively, net of deferred financing costs. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the term loan facility had a carrying value of   $1.2 billion   and   $929.5 million  , respectively, net of deferred financing costs. 
  We, SL Green and the Operating Partnership are all borrowers jointly and severally obligated under the 2012 credit facility. None of SL Green's other subsidiaries are obligors under the 2012 credit facility. 
  The 2012 credit facility includes certain restrictions and covenants (see Restrictive Covenants below). 
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
  The following table sets forth our senior unsecured notes and other related disclosures as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, by scheduled maturity date (dollars in thousands): 

__________________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually with principal and unpaid interest due on the scheduled maturity dates. 
              (2) 
    Issued by SL Green, the Operating Partnership and ROP, as co-obligors. 
      ROP also provides a guaranty of the Operating Partnership's obligations under its   3.00%   Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2017.

     Table of Contents  

Restrictive Covenants 
  The terms of the 2012 credit facility, as amended, and certain of our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit, among other things, SL Green's ability to pay dividends, make certain types of investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and dispose of assets, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value, a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges, a maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value. The dividend restriction referred to above provides that SL Green will not during any time when a default is continuing, make distributions with respect to SL Green's common stock or other equity interests, except to enable SL Green to continue to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. As of   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable rate debt. Our exposure to interest rate changes are managed through either the use of interest rate derivative instruments and/or through our variable rate debt and preferred equity investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve for   2016   would decrease our annual interest cost, net of interest income from variable rate debt, by approximately   $6.1 million  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   $1.2 billion   of our   $1.8 billion   debt and preferred equity portfolio is indexed to LIBOR. 
  We recognize most derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If a derivative is considered a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. 
  We have   $2.1 billion   of long term debt that bears interest at fixed rates, and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates. Our variable rate debt as of   September 30, 2016   bore interest based on a spread of LIBOR plus   140   basis points to LIBOR plus   273   basis points. 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  Refer to our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our contractual obligations. There have been no material changes, outside the ordinary course of business, to these contractual obligations during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have off-balance sheet investments, including preferred equity investments. These investments all have varying ownership structures. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 5, "Preferred Equity Investments and Other Investments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Capital Expenditures 
  We estimate that for the year ending   December 31, 2016  , we expect to incur   $2.5 million   of recurring capital expenditures and   $16.6 million   of development or redevelopment expenditures, net of loan reserves, (including tenant improvements and leasing commissions) on existing properties. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with operating cash flow, additional property level mortgage financings and cash on hand. Future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments for refurbishment and leasing costs. We expect our capital needs over the next twelve-months and thereafter will be met through a combination of cash on hand, net cash provided by operations, borrowings, potential asset sales or additional debt issuances. 
   
  Related Party Transactions 
  Cleaning/ Security/ Messenger and Restoration Services 
  Alliance Building Services, or Alliance, and its affiliates are partially owned by Gary Green, a son of Stephen L. Green, the chairman of SL Green's board of directors, and provide services to certain properties owned by us. Alliance s affiliates include First Quality Maintenance, L.P., or First Quality, Classic Security LLC, Bright Star Couriers LLC and Onyx Restoration Works, and provide cleaning, extermination, security, messenger, and restoration services, respectively. In addition, First Quality has the non-exclusive opportunity to provide cleaning and related services to individual tenants at our properties on a basis separately negotiated with any tenant seeking such additional services. An affiliate of ours has entered into an arrangement with Alliance whereby it will receive a profit participation above a certain threshold for services provided by Alliance to certain tenants at certain buildings above the base services specified in their lease agreements. Income earned from profit participation, which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations, was   $0.8 million   and   $2.5 million   for both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015.  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

We also recorded expenses for these services, inclusive of capitalized expenses, of   $1.2 million   and   $6.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, (excluding services provided directly to tenants), and   $2.7 million   and   $6.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Allocated Expenses from SL Green 
  Property operating expenses include an allocation of salary and other operating costs from SL Green based on square footage of the related properties. Such amount was approximately   $2.8 million   and   $8.2 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The amount was   $2.4 million   and   $7.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Insurance 
  SL Green maintains  all-risk  property and rental value coverage (including coverage regarding the perils of flood, earthquake and terrorism) within three property insurance portfolios and liability insurance. The first property portfolio maintains a blanket limit of $950.0 million per occurrence, including terrorism, for the majority of the New York City properties in our portfolio and expires December 31, 2015. The second portfolio maintains a limit of $1.5 billion per occurrence, including terrorism, for several New York City properties and the majority of the Suburban properties and expires December 31, 2016. Each of these policies includes $100.0 million of flood coverage, with a lower sublimit for locations in high hazard flood zones. A third blanket property policy covers most of our residential assets and maintains a limit of $386.0 million per occurrence, including terrorism, for our residential properties and expires January 31, 2018. We maintain two liability policies which cover all our properties and provide limits of $201.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate per location. The liability policies expire on October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2017 and cover our commercial and residential properties, respectively. Additional coverage may be purchased on a stand-alone basis for certain assets. 
  In October 2006, SL Green formed a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, to act as a captive insurance company and be one of the elements of our overall insurance program. Belmont is a subsidiary of SL Green. Belmont was formed in an effort to, among other reasons, stabilize to some extent the fluctuations of insurance market conditions. Belmont is licensed in New York to write Terrorism, NBCR (nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological), General Liability, Environmental Liability, and D O coverage. 
  The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, which was enacted in November 2002, was renewed December 31, 2005 and again on December 31, 2007. Congress extended TRIA, now called TRIPRA (Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2007) until December 31, 2014.  TRIPRA was not renewed by Congress and expired on December 31, 2014. However, on January 12, 2015, TRIPRA was reauthorized until December 31, 2020 (Terrorism Insurance Program Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2015).The law extends the federal Terrorism Insurance Program that requires insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage and provides for compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of certified terrorism, subject to the current program trigger of $100.0 million, which will increase by $20 million per annum, commencing December 31, 2015. Our debt instruments, consisting of a non-recourse mortgage note secured by one of our properties, our 2012 credit facility, senior unsecured notes and other corporate obligations, as well as ground leases, contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we currently maintain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these obligations, there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to procure coverage at a reasonable cost. In such instances, there can be no assurance that the lenders or ground lessors under these instruments will not take the position that a total or partial exclusion from  all-risk  insurance coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt and ground lease instruments allowing the lenders or ground lessors to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of debt or recapture of ground lease positions. In addition, if lenders prevail in asserting that we are required to maintain full coverage for these risks, it could result in substantially higher insurance premiums. 
  We monitor all properties where insurance coverage is obtained by a third party and we do not control the coverage to ensure that tenants or other third parties, as applicable, are providing adequate coverage. Certain joint ventures may be covered under policies separate from our policies, at coverage limits which we deem to be adequate. We continually monitor these policies. Although we consider our insurance coverage to be appropriate, in the event of a major catastrophe, we may not have sufficient coverage to replace certain properties. 
  We obtained insurance coverage through an insurance program administered by SL Green. In connection with this program, we incurred insurance expense of approximately   $1.5 million  ,   $4.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  We incurred insurance expense of approximately   $1.7 million   and   $5.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
   
  Inflation 
  Substantially all of our office leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations as well as operating expense recoveries based on increases in the Consumer Price Index or other measures such as porters' wage. In addition, many of  
  
   34 

the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases will be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above.

These risks and uncertainties include: 
             
    the effect of general economic, business and financial conditions, and their effect on the New York City real estate market in particular; 
                
    dependence upon certain geographic markets;

In addition, sections of SL Green and the Operating Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contain additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, ROP operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on ROP's business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially

  For quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, see Item 2, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Interest Rate Risk" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December 31, 2015. 
   
  ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within ROP to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the President and Treasurer of our general partner, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, the President and Treasurer of our general partner concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurances to the timely collection, evaluation and disclosure of information relating to ROP that would potentially be subject to disclosure under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
