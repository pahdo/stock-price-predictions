QUICKLOGIC CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1   The Company and Basis of Presentation 
    
  QuickLogic Corporation ("QuickLogic" or "the Company") was founded in 1988 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999. The Company enables Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs") to maximize battery life for highly differentiated, immersive user experiences with Smartphone, Wearable, Tablet and Internet-of-Things ("IoT") devices. QuickLogic delivers these benefits through industry leading ultra-low power customer programmable System on Chip ("SoC") semiconductor solutions, embedded software, and algorithm solutions for always-on voice and sensor processing, and enhanced visual experiences. The Company is a fabless semiconductor provider of comprehensive, flexible sensor processing solutions, ultra-low power display bridges, and ultra-low power Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs. 
    
  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, these statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. The Company recommends that these interim condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended   January 3, 2016  . Operating results for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.  
    
  QuickLogic's fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31 and the fiscal quarters each end on the Sunday closest to the end of each calendar quarter. QuickLogic's   third   fiscal quarters for   2016   and for   2015   ended on Sunday,   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  The Company has financed its operations and capital investments through sales of common stock, capital and operating leases, and bank lines of credit. As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company's principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of   $17.8 million   and   $1.0 million   in available credit under its revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank, which expires on September 25, 2017.  
    
  On September 25, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank to extend the line of credit for   two   years through September 25, 2017. This amendment modifies some of the financial covenants. This line of credit provides for committed loan advances of up to   $6.0 million  , subject to increases at the Company's election of up to   $12.0 million  . On February 10, 2016, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to Third and Restated Loan and Security Agreement to further modify the covenants. See Note 5 for a description of the modified covenants. The Company is in compliance with all loan covenants as of the end of the current reporting period. 
    
  On March 21, 2016, the Company issued   10.0 million   shares of common stock at a price of   $1.00   per share,   $0.001   par value. The Company received net proceeds of approximately   $8.8 million  , after deducting underwriting commissions and other offering related expenses. The Company uses the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire and/or license technologies and acquire and/or invest in businesses when the opportunity arises. The shares were offered pursuant to a shelf registration statement previously filed with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on August 30, 2013, and as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated March 17, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
    
  The Company currently uses its cash to fund its capital expenditures and operating losses. Based on past operating performance and current annual operating plans, the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with available financial resources from the revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank and equity funding raised during March 2016 will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditures and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months. 
    
  The Company's liquidity is affected by many factors including, among others: the level of revenue and gross profit as a result of the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry; the conversion of design opportunities into revenue; market acceptance of existing and new products including solutions based on its EOS   TM   , ArcticLink , and PolarPro  solution platforms;

  NOTES TO CONDENSED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)  

fluctuations in revenue as a result of product end-of-life; fluctuations in revenue as a result of the stage in the product life cycle of its customers' products; costs of securing access to and availability of adequate manufacturing capacity; levels of inventories; wafer purchase commitments; customer credit terms; the amount and timing of research and development expenditures; the timing of new product introductions; production volumes; product quality; sales and marketing efforts; the value and liquidity of its investment portfolio; changes in operating assets and liabilities; the ability to obtain or renew debt financing and to remain in compliance with the terms of existing credit facilities; the ability to raise funds from the sale of equity in the Company; the issuance and exercise of stock options and participation in the Company's employee stock purchase plan; and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economics. 
    
  Over the longer term, the Company anticipates that the generation of sales from its new product offerings, existing cash and cash equivalents, together with financial resources from its revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank and its ability to raise additional capital in the public capital markets will be sufficient to satisfy its operations and capital expenditures requirements. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to raise additional capital, if required, or that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. The inability of the Company to generate sufficient sales from its new product offerings and/or raise additional capital if needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operations and financial condition, including its ability to maintain compliance with its lender s financial covenants. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of QuickLogic and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  
    
  Foreign Currency 
    
  The functional currency of the Company's non-U.S. operations is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current period-end exchange rates and non-monetary assets and related elements of expense are translated using historical exchange rates. Income and expense elements are translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses from the foreign currency transactions of these subsidiaries are recorded as interest income and other expense, net in the condensed unaudited consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Uses of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates, particularly in relation to revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, valuation of investments, valuation of long-lived assets including mask sets, valuation of inventories including identification of excess quantities, market value and obsolescence, measurement of stock-based compensation awards, accounting for income taxes and estimating accrued liabilities. 
    
  Concentration of Risk 
    
  The Company's accounts receivable are denominated in U.S. dollars and are derived primarily from sales to customers located in North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. See Note 11 for information regarding concentrations associated with accounts receivable.  
    
  For the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , the Company generated   39%   and   35%   of its total revenue from shipments to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. ("Samsung"). See Note 11 for information regarding concentrations associated with customers and distributors.

Note 2   Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , there were no changes in the Company's significant accounting policies from its disclosure in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 3, 2016  . For a discussion of the significant accounting policies, please see the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016  , filed with the SEC, on   March 18, 2016  . 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements       
       
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This update clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
       
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . This update among other things: (1) clarify the object of the collectability criterion for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from transaction price; (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception; (4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior period reporting is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. This amendment is effective for public entities for annual reports beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. For nonpublic entities one year later. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
       
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This update was issued as part of the FASB s simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance can be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
       
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations     Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net.   The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09. Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein (i.e., January 1, 2018, for a calendar year entity). Private entities must apply the amendments one year later. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
       
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases.   The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the

  NOTES TO CONDENSED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)  

financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
       
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330):     Simplifying the measurement of Inventory,    which amends the accounting guidance on the valuation of inventory. The guidance requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendment applies to inventory valued at first-in, first-out or average cost. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.  
       
  Other new accounting pronouncements are disclosed on the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016   filed with the SEC on   March 18, 2016  . 

Note 3   Net Loss Per Share 
    
  Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share was computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method. In computing diluted net loss per share, the weighted average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and warrants. 
    
  The following shares were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  : (i)   7.8 million   and   6.8 million   of common shares associated with equity awards outstanding and the estimated number of shares to be purchased under the current offering period of the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, respectively, and (ii) warrants to purchase up to   2.3 million   shares of common stock as of   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. These shares were not included as they were considered antidilutive due to the net loss the Company experienced during these periods.

Note 5   Financing Obligations 
    
  The following provides details relating to the Company s financing obligations as of   October 2, 2016   and January 3, 2016: 

Revolving Line of Credit 
    
  On September 25, 2015, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated September 25, 2015 ("the Loan Agreement") with Silicon Valley Bank (the "Bank"). The terms of the Loan Agreement include a   $6.0 million   revolving line of credit available through   September 25, 2017  , subject to increases at the Company's election of up to   $12 million  . Upon each advance, the Company can elect a Prime Rate advance, which is the prime rate plus the prime rate margin, or a LIBOR advance, which is LIBOR rate plus the LIBOR rate margin. As of the   third   quarter ended   October 2, 2016  , the Company had   $5.0 million   of revolving debt outstanding with an interest rate of   3.63%  . 
    
   On February 10, 2016, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with the Bank to amend certain covenants contained in the Loan Agreement. As amended, the Company is required to maintain, beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2016, (i) a tangible net worth of at least   $12.0 million  , plus (a)   50%   of the proceeds from any equity issuance, plus (b)   50%   of the proceeds from any investments, tested as of the last day of each month; (ii) unrestricted cash or cash equivalents at the Bank or Bank's affiliates at all times in an amount of at least   $6.0 million  ; and (iii) a ratio of quick assets to the results of (i) current liabilities minus (ii) the current portion of deferred revenue plus (iii) the long-term portion of the obligations of at least   2.00   to 1.00, tested as of the last day of each month. Beginning with the second fiscal quarter of 2016, the tangible net worth requirement, is reduced as follows: For the quarter ending June 30, 2016, at least   $10.0 million  ; for the quarter ending September 30, 2016, at least   $8.0 million  ; for the quarter ending December 31, 2016, at least   $6.0 million  ; for the quarter ending March 31, 2017, at least   $4.0 million  ; for the quarter ending June 30, 2017, at least   $8.0 million  . Beginning with the third fiscal quarter of 2016, the Company is required to maintain a ratio of quick assets to the results of (i) current liabilities minus (ii) the current portion of deferred revenue plus (iii) the long-term portion of the obligations of at least   1.50   to 1.00 in the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 and of at least   1.25   to 1.00 in the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. 
    
  The Bank has a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company's tangible and intangible assets to secure any outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement.  
    
  Capital Leases 
    
  In December 2015, the Company leased design software under a   two  -year capital lease at an imputed interest rate of   4.88%   per annum. Terms of the agreement require the Company to make quarterly payments of approximately   $22,750   through November 2017, for a total of   $182,000  . As of   October 2, 2016  ,   $109,000   was outstanding under the capital lease,   $87,000   of which was classified as a current liability.

The total payments for the lease will be   $174,000  . As of   October 2, 2016  ,   $56,000   was outstanding under this capital lease, all of which was classified as a current liability. 

Note 6   Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurements and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 
    
  The accounting guidance for fair value measurement also specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs), or reflect the Company's own assumptions of market participant valuation (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels: 

Level 1     Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2     Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3     Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable. 
       
  The following table presents the Company's financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , consistent with the fair value hierarchy provisions of the authoritative guidance (in thousands):

Note 8   Employee Stock Plans 
    
  2009 Stock Plan 
    
  The 2009 Stock Plan, or 2009 Plan, was amended and restated by the Board of Directors in January 2015 and approved by the Company's stockholders on April 23, 2015 to, among other things, reserve an additional   2.5 million   shares of common stock for issuance under the 2009 Plan. As of   October 2, 2016  , approximately   9.8 million   shares were reserved for issuance under the 2009 Plan. Equity awards that are cancelled, forfeited or repurchased under the 1999 Plan become available for grant under the 2009 Plan, up to a maximum of an additional   10 million   shares. Equity awards granted under the 2009 Plan have a term of up to   ten   years. Options typically vest at a rate of   25%     one   year after the vesting commencement date, and one forty-eighth for each month of service thereafter. RSUs typically vest at a rate of   25%     one   year after the vesting commencement date, and one eighth every six months thereafter. The Company may implement different vesting schedules in the future with respect to any new equity awards. 
    
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  The 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2009 ESPP, was adopted in March 2009. In January 2015, the 2009 ESPP was amended by the Board of Directors and approved by the Company's stockholders on April 23, 2015 to reserve an additional   1.0 million   shares of common stock for issuance under the 2009 ESPP. As of   October 2, 2016  , approximately   3.3 million   shares were reserved for issuance under the 2009 ESPP Plan. The 2009 ESPP provides for   six   month offering periods. Participants purchase shares through payroll deductions of up to   20%   of an employee's total compensation (maximum of   20,000   shares per offering period). The 2009 ESPP permits the Board of Directors to determine, prior to each offering period, whether participants purchase shares at: (i)   85%   of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of the offering period; or (ii)   85%   of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or the end of an offering period. The Board of Directors has determined that, until further notice, future offering periods will be made at   85%   of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or the end of an offering period. 

Note 9   Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company's equity incentive program is a broad-based, long-term retention program intended to attract, motivate, and retain talented employees as well as align stockholder and employee interests. The Company provides stock-based incentive compensation, or awards, to eligible employees and non-employee directors. Awards that may be granted under the program include non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance-based restricted stock units, or PRSUs, and cash settlement of stock appreciation rights, or SARs. To date, awards granted under the program consist of stock options, RSUs and PRSUs. The majority of stock-based awards granted under the program vest over   four   years. Stock options granted under the program have a maximum contractual term of   ten   years.

The stock-based compensation expense included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   was as follows (in thousands): 

No stock-based compensation was capitalized during any period presented above.  
  * Stock-based compensation related to restructuring plan was initiated during the second quarter of 2015.  
    
  Valuation Assumptions 
    
  The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under the Company's 2009 ESPP. Using the Black-Scholes pricing model requires the Company to develop highly subjective assumptions including the expected term of awards, expected volatility of its stock, expected risk-free interest rate and expected dividend rate over the term of the award. The Company's expected term of awards assumption is based primarily on its historical experience with similar grants. The Company's expected stock price volatility assumption for both stock options and ESPP shares is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock, using the daily average of the opening and closing prices and measured using historical data appropriate for the expected term. The risk-free interest rate assumption approximates the risk-free interest rate of a Treasury Constant Maturity bond with a maturity approximately equal to the expected term of the stock option or ESPP shares. This fair value is expensed over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value of RSUs and PRSUs is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Equity compensation awards which vest with service are expensed using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period.  
    
  In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model, the amended authoritative guidance requires that the Company recognize expense for awards ultimately expected to vest; therefore the Company is required to develop an estimate of the number of awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting, or forfeiture rate. The forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical pre-vest cancellation experience and is applied to all share-based awards.  
    
  The following weighted average assumptions are included in the estimated fair value calculations for stock option grants: 

The weighted average estimated fair value for options granted during the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016   was   $0.46  . No stock options were granted in the third quarter of 2015. The weighted average estimated fair value for options granted during the   nine months   of 2016 and   2015   were   $0.46   and   $0.90   per option, respectively. As of   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , the fair value of unvested stock options, net of expected forfeitures, was approximately   $1.9 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively. This unrecognized stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recorded over a weighted average period of   3.33   years.

No stock options were exercised during the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016. 
    
  The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   was   $0   and   $83,000  , respectively. Total cash received from employees as a result of employee stock option exercises during the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015   was approximately   $0   and   $117,000   respectively. The Company settles employee stock option exercises with newly issued common shares. In connection with these exercises, there was no tax benefit realized by the Company due to the Company's current loss position. Total stock-based compensation related to stock options was   $189,000   and   $403,000   for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  . 
    
  Restricted Stock Units and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units 
    
  The Company began issuing RSUs and PRSUs in the third quarter of 2007. RSUs entitle the holder to receive, at no cost, one common share for each RSU as it vests. In general, the Company's policy is to withhold shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of RSUs. The stock-based compensation related to RSUs and PRSUs was   $154,000   and   $49,000   for the   three   months and   $693,000   and   $137,000   for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , respectively. As of   October 2, 2016  , there was   $1.3 million   in unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs and PRSUs.

A summary of activity for the Company's RSUs and PRSUs for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   and information regarding RSUs and PRSUs outstanding and expected to vest as of   October 2, 2016   is as follows: 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  The weighted average estimated fair value, as defined by the amended authoritative guidance, of rights issued pursuant to the Company's 2009 ESPP during the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015   was   $0.31   and   $0.48   per right, respectively.  
    
  As of   October 2, 2016  ,   917,000   shares remained available for issuance under the 2009 ESPP. For the   three   and   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  , the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to the 2009 ESPP of   $65,000   and   $225,000  , respectively. 
    
  The fair value of rights issued pursuant to the Company's 2009 ESPP was estimated on the commencement date of each offering period using the following weighted average assumptions: 

As of   October 2, 2016  , the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relating to the Company's 2009 ESPP was   $31,000   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   1.5   months. 

Note 10   Income Taxes 
    
  In the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded a net income tax benefit of   $23,000   and   $15,000  , respectively. For the   nine months   ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, the Company recorded net income tax expense of   $68,000   and   $46,000  , respectively. The income tax benefits for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 include the net effect of the following: (i) income taxes from the Company's foreign operations which are cost-plus entities; and (ii) the release of an unrecognized tax benefit in the period. 
    
  Based on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company's net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, with the exception of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against the associated deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in future periods. 
    
    The Company had approximately   $0   and   $36,000   unrecognized tax benefits at October 2, 2016 and January 3, 2016, respectively, which, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. For the   nine   month period ended   October 2, 2016  , the

Overview 
    
  We enable OEMs to maximize battery life for highly differentiated, immersive user experiences with Smartphone, Wearable, Tablet and IoT devices. We deliver these benefits through industry leading ultra-low power customer programmable SoC semiconductor solutions, embedded software, and algorithm solutions for always-on voice and sensor processing, and enhanced visual experiences. Our solutions typically fall into one of three categories: Sensor Processing, Display and Visual Enhancement, and Smart Connectivity. We are a fabless semiconductor company that designs, markets, and supports primarily silicon solutions, and, secondarily, Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs, sensor software algorithms, software drivers, associated design software and programming hardware. Our solutions are created from our new silicon platforms including our EOS , ArcticLink  III, PolarPro 3, PolarPro II, PolarPro, and Eclipse II products (which together comprise our new product category). Our mature products include primarily pASIC 3 and QuickRAM  as well as programming hardware and design software.           
  Our customer-specific solutions include a unique combination of our silicon platforms, proven system blocks, or PSBs, custom logic, sensor software algorithms, software drivers, and in some cases, firmware, and application software. All of our silicon platforms are standard devices and must be programmed to be effective in a system. Our PSBs range from intellectual property, or IP, which enables always-on context aware sensor applications, such as our Flexible Fusion Engine, or FFE, and our Sensor Manager and Communications Manager technologies; to IP that improves multimedia content, such as our Visual Enhancement Engine, or VEE technology, and Display Power Optimizer technology, or DPO; to IP which implements commonly used mobile system interfaces, such as Low Voltage Differential Signaling, or LVDS, Mobile Industry Processor Interface, or MIPI, Secure Digital Input Output, or SDIO. We provide complete solutions by first architecting the solution jointly with our customer's or ecosystem partner s engineering group, selecting the appropriate solution platform and PSBs, providing custom logic, integrating the logic, programming the device with the PSBs and/or firmware, providing software drivers or application software required for the customer's application, and participating with the customer on-site during

integration, verification and testing. In many cases, we may deliver sensor software algorithms that have been optimized for use in our silicon platform.          
  We also work with mobile processor manufacturers, sensor manufacturers, and/or sensor fusion and context awareness algorithm developers in the development of reference designs, Qualified Vendor Lists, or QVLs, or  Catalog  solutions. Through reference designs that incorporate our solutions, we believe mobile processor manufacturers, sensor manufacturers, and sensor algorithm companies can expand the served available market for their respective products. Furthermore, should a solution development for a processor manufacturer or sensor and/or sensor algorithm company be applicable to a set of common OEMs or Original Design Manufacturers ("ODMs"), we can amortize our R D investment over that set of OEMs or ODMs. We call this type of solution a Catalog solution and we are placing a greater emphasis on developing and marketing these solutions. 
    
  In order to grow our revenue from its current level, we depend upon increased revenue from our new products including existing new product platforms and platforms currently in development. We expect our business growth to be driven by silicon solutions and our solutions revenue growth needs to be strong enough to enable us to sustain profitability while we continue to invest in the development, sales and marketing of our new solution platforms and PSBs. The gross margin associated with our solutions is generally lower than the gross margin of our FPGA products, due primarily to the price sensitive nature of the higher volume mobile consumer opportunities that we are pursuing with our solutions. 
    
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we generated total revenue of   $2.8 million  . This represents an increase of   3%   from the prior quarter and a decrease of   33%   from the   third   quarter of   2015  . Our new product revenue was   $1.3 million  , an increase of   12%   from the prior quarter and a decrease of   53%   from the   third   quarter of 2015. The sequential increase and year over year decrease was primarily due to fluctuations of our display bridge product ArcticLink III revenue and also our smart connectivity solutions revenue. We anticipate new product revenue generated from our display bridge solution and smart connectivity solutions will continue to fluctuate depending on the demand in the Android tablet market.  
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , revenue generated from Samsung accounted for   83%   of our new product revenue and     39%   of our total revenue compared to   71%   and   31%  , respectively, for the second quarter of 2016. During the   third   quarter of 2016, we shipped new products into the tablet, smartphone and mobile enterprise markets. Our mature product revenue was     $1.5 million  , a decrease of   3%   from the prior quarter and an increase of   10%   from the third quarter of 2015. We expect our mature product revenue to continue to fluctuate over time.  
    
  We devote substantially all of our development, sales and marketing efforts to our new sensor processing solutions designed using our ArcticLink 3 S2 and EOS   TM    S3 platforms, derivative products based on software-driven features, and the development of additional new products and solution platforms. Overall, we reported a net loss of   $4.6 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to a net loss of   $5.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  

Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical policies include revenue recognition, valuation of inventories including identification of excess quantities and product obsolescence, valuation of investments, valuation of long-lived assets, measurement of stock-based compensation and estimation of accrued liabilities. We believe that we apply judgments and estimates in a consistent manner and that this consistent application results in consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented. However, any factual errors or errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our financial statements. During the   nine months   ended October 2, 2016, there were no changes in our critical accounting policies from our disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016  , filed with the SEC on   March 18, 2016  . For a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates, please see Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016  , filed with the SEC on   March 18, 2016  .

Three Months Ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015    
    
  Revenue 
    
  The table below sets forth the changes in revenue for the three months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 27, 2015   (in thousands, except percentage data): 

_________________ 
    
  (1)              For all periods presented: New products include all products manufactured on 180 nanometer or smaller semiconductor processes. Mature products include all products produced on semiconductor processes larger than 180 nanometers. 
    
  The $1.5 million decrease in new product revenue was primarily due to decreased shipment of ArcticLink III display bridge solutions of $1.2 million and decreased shipments of smart connectivity products of $279,000. Revenue from Samsung in the third quarter of 2016 was   $1.1 million   compared to $  2.4 million   in the third quarter of 2015. The impact of lower sales prices on the revenue in the third quarter of 2016 was approximately   $17,000  , or   1%   of total revenue, compared to the third quarter of 2015. The $131,000 increase in mature product revenue was primarily due to increased orders from our customers in the aerospace, test and instrumentation sectors. We anticipate that our revenue from tablets and mature products will decline over time.  
  In order to grow our revenue from its current level, we depend upon increased revenue from our new products, especially revenue from our new sensor processing solutions designed using our ArcticLink 3 S2 and EOS   TM    S3 platforms, derivative products based on software-driven features, and the development of additional new products and solution platforms. 
    
  We continue to seek to expand our revenue, including pursuing high-volume sales opportunities in our target market segments, by providing solutions incorporating our and/or third parties' intellectual property, as well as industry standard interfaces. Our industry is characterized by price competition and by lower margins as order volumes increase. While winning large volume sales opportunities will increase our revenue, we believe these opportunities may decrease our gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
    
  Gross Profit 
    
  The table below sets forth the changes in gross profit for the three months ended   October 2, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 27, 2015   (in thousands, except percentage data): 

The   $351,000   decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume while the 2% increase in the gross margin as a percentage of revenue during the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , was primarily due to an increase of matured product composition in total revenue. In the third quarter of 2016, matured products consisted 52% of total revenue compared to 32% in the third quarter of 2015. The impact of lower sales prices on the gross  
  
    24 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Continued) 

profit in the   third   quarter of 2016 was approximately   $17,000  , or   1%  , compared to the   third   quarter of 2015. The sale of previously reserved inventory was   $15,000   and   $49,000   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Our semiconductor products have historically had long product life cycles and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. However, as we continue to pursue opportunities in the mobile market and develop new solutions and products, our product life cycle will be shorter and the risk of obsolescence will increase.  
    
  We regularly review the cost of inventories and purchase commitments against estimated market value and record a lower of cost or market reserve for inventories that have a cost in excess of estimated market value. This could have a material impact on our gross margin and inventory balances based on additional write-downs to net realizable value or a benefit from inventories previously written down. In general, our standard manufacturing lead times are longer than the binding forecasts we receive from customers.  
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  The table below sets forth the changes in operating expenses for the three months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to the three months ended   September 27, 2015   (in thousands, except percentage data): 

Research and Development 
    
  Our research and development, or R D, expenses consist primarily of personnel, overhead and other costs associated with engineering process improvements, sensor hub and algorithm development, programmable logic design, CSSP design and software development. The   $929,000   decrease in R D expenses in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , was primarily attributable to our strategic re-alignment measures implemented in the second quarter of 2016, which resulted in reduction of compensation related cost by $291,000, outside services cost by $301,000, and other supplies and IP purchases related costs by $260,000.  
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
    
  Our selling, general and administrative, or SG A, expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, finance, administration, human resources and general management. The   $196,000   increase in SG A expenses in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , was primarily due to compensation related costs incurred in the third quarter of 2016.  
           
  Interest Expense and Interest Income and Other Expense, Net 
    
  The table below sets forth the changes in interest expense and net interest income and other expense, for the three months ended   October 2, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 27, 2015   (in thousands, except percentage data):

  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Continued) 

We conduct a portion of our research and development activities in India and we have sales and marketing activities in various countries outside of the United States. Most of these international expenses are incurred in local currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net interest and other income (expense), as they occur. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and, therefore, our results of operations are, and will continue to be, susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange gains or losses. Historically, impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the profit or loss has been immaterial. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The table below sets forth the changes in the income tax provision for the three months ended   October 2, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 27, 2015   (in thousands, except percentage data): 

The income tax benefits for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 include the net effect of the following: (i) income taxes from our foreign operations which are cost-plus entities; and (ii) the release of an unrecognized tax benefit in the period. 
    
  As of October 2,   2016  , our ability to utilize our income tax loss carryforwards in future periods is uncertain, and accordingly, we recorded a full valuation allowance against the related U.S. tax provision. We will continue to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets in future periods.

Nine Months Ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015    
    
  Revenue 
    
  The table below sets forth the changes in revenue for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 27, 2015   (in thousands, except percentage data): 

_________________ 
    
  (1)              For all periods presented: New products include all products manufactured on 180 nanometer or smaller semiconductor processes. Mature products include all products produced on semiconductor processes larger than 180 nanometers. 
    
  The $5.9 million decrease in new product revenue was primarily due to decreased shipments of ArcticLink III display bridge solutions of $3.7 million, and decreased shipments of smart connectivity products of Eclipse II, QuickPCI II, PolarPro and ArcticLink of $2.2 million. Revenue from Samsung in the nine months of 2016 was $  3.0 million   compared to $  6.8 million   in the nine months of 2015. The impact of lower sales prices on the revenue in the nine months of 2016 was approximately   $47,000   or   0.6%   of total revenue, compared to the nine months of 2015. The Company's revenue from Samsung accounted for   74%   of new product revenue and   35%   of total revenue for the   nine months   of   2016   compared to   69%   and   44%   for the   nine months   of 2015. The $926,000 million decrease in mature product revenue was primarily due to decreased orders from our customers in the aerospace, test and instrumentation sectors. We anticipate that our new product revenue from display bridge solutions in tablets will decline over time and our mature product revenue will continue to fluctuate.  
       
  In order to grow our revenue from its current level, we depend upon increased revenue from our new products, especially revenue from our new sensor processing solutions designed using our ArcticLink 3 S2 and EOS   TM    S3 platforms, derivative products based on software-driven features, and the development of additional new products and solution platforms.

The   $3.4 million   decrease in gross profit in absolute dollars and the 8% decrease in the gross margin as a percentage of revenue during the   nine   months ended October 2,   2016  , as compared to the   nine   months ended September 27,   2015  , was  
  
    27 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Continued) 

primarily due to the sales volume decrease in new and matured product revenue. See above revenue table for further details. Inventory reserve for excess and obsolete inventory in the nine months ended October 2, 2016 was $236,000 compared to $14,000 in the nine months ended September 27, 2015. The impact of lower sales prices on the gross profit in the first   nine months   of 2016 was approximately   $47,000  , or   0.6%   compared to the   nine months   of 2015. The sale of previously reserved inventory was   $72,000   and   $170,000   in the   nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Historically, our semiconductor products have had long product life cycles and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. However, as we continue to pursue opportunities in the mobile market and develop new solutions and products, our product life cycle will be shorter and the risk of obsolescence will increase.  
    
  We regularly review the cost of inventories and purchase commitments against estimated market value and record a lower of cost or market reserve for inventories that have a cost in excess of estimated market value. This could have a material impact on our gross margin and inventory balances based on additional write-downs to net realizable value or a benefit from inventories previously written down. In general, our standard manufacturing lead times are longer than the binding forecasts we receive from customers.  
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  The table below sets forth the changes in operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 27, 2015   (in thousands, except percentage data): 

Research and Development 
    
  Our research and development, or R D, expenses consist primarily of personnel, overhead and other costs associated with engineering process improvements, sensor hub and algorithm development, programmable logic design, CSSP design and software development. The   $769,000   decrease in R D expenses in the   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the   nine   months of   2015  , was primarily attributable to our strategic re-alignment measures implemented in the second quarter of 2016, which resulted in lower outside services cost of $602,000 and lower R D compensation related cost of $288,000.  
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
    
  Our selling, general and administrative, or SG A, expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, finance, administration, human resources and general management. The   $170,000   decrease in SG A expenses in the   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to the   nine   months of   2015  , was primarily due to our strategic re-alignment measures implemented in the second quarter of 2016, which resulted in lower SG A compensation related cost of $370,000, partially offset by severance related charges in the third quarter of 2016. 
       
  Interest Expense and Interest Income and Other Expense, Net 
    
  The table below sets forth the changes in net interest expense and interest income and other expense, for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 27, 2015   (in thousands, except percentage data):

  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Continued) 

The increase in interest expense of $45,000 in the   nine   months of 2016 compared to the   nine   months of 2015 was primarily due to additional borrowings of $3.0 million from our line of credit in the nine months ended October 2, 2016. The decrease of $35,000 in net interest income and other expenses was primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses from the transactions of our foreign subsidiaries. 
    
  We conduct a portion of our research and development activities in India and we have sales and marketing activities in various countries outside of the United States. Most of these international expenses are incurred in local currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net interest and other income (expense), as they occur. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and, therefore, our results of operations are, and will continue to be, susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange gains or losses. Historically, impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the profit or loss has been immaterial. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The table below sets forth the changes in the income tax provision for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 27, 2015   (in thousands, except percentage data): 

The income tax provisions for the first   nine   months of   2016   and 2015 were primarily attributable to our foreign operations, which operate on a cost plus basis. 
    
  As of   October 2, 2016  , our ability to utilize our income tax loss carryforwards in future periods is uncertain, and accordingly, we recorded a full valuation allowance against the related U.S. tax provision. We will continue to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets in future periods. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We have financed our operating losses and capital investments through sales of common stock, private equity investments, capital and operating leases, a revolving line of credit and cash flows from operations. As of   October 2, 2016  , our principal sources of liquidity consisted of our cash and cash equivalents of   $17.8 million   and   $1.0 million   in available credit under our revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank, which matures on   September 25, 2017  . Additionally, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $236 million and experienced net losses in the past years and expect such losses to continue through at least the current fiscal year ending January 1, 2017, as we continue to develop new products, applications and technologies. 
    
  On September 25, 2015, we entered into a Second Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the "Loan Agreement") with Silicon Valley Bank (the "Bank") to extend the line of credit for two years through September 25, 2017. The Second Amendment to the Loan Agreement provides for committed loan advances of up to $6.0 million, subject to increases at our election of up to $12.0 million and also modified some of the financial covenants. On February 10, 2016, we entered into a Third Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement to further modify certain financial covenants. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on these agreements. 
    
  On March 21, 2016, we issued 10.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $1.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $8.8 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and other offering related expenses. We  
  
    29 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Continued) 

have used and plan to continue to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire and/or license technologies and acquire and/or invest in businesses when the opportunity arises. The shares were offered pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on August 30, 2013, and as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated March 17, 2016 filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this offering. 
    
  As of October 2, 2016, most of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in JP Morgan US Government money market funds rated AAAm/Aaa. As of   October 2, 2016  , our interest-bearing debt consisted of   $230,000   outstanding under capital leases and   $5.0 million   outstanding under our revolving line of credit.   
    
  Cash balances held at our foreign subsidiaries were approximately $505,000 and $1.2 million at   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , respectively. Earnings from our foreign subsidiaries are currently deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We do not expect such reinvestment to affect our liquidity and capital resources, and we continually evaluate our liquidity needs and ability to meet global cash requirements as a part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Factors which affect our global capital deployment strategy include anticipated cash flows, the ability to repatriate cash in a tax efficient manner, funding requirements for operations and investment activities, acquisitions and divestitures and capital market conditions.        
    
    In summary, our cash flows were as follows (in thousands): 

Net cash used in operating activities 
    
  Net cash used in operating activities was   $11.7 million   in the   nine months   of   2016  . The cash used in operating activities was a result of the net loss of   $15.3 million  , partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $579,000   and   $3.0 million   of net non-cash charges. Non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of   $1.5 million  , depreciation and amortization of   $972,000  , a write-down of inventory of   $236,000   and a write-off of equipment of $351,000. The cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was mostly due to a decrease in inventory of   $1.2 million   as a result of sales of existing inventory, a decrease in trade receivable of   $579,000  , a decrease of   $408,000   in other assets, an increase of other liabilities of   $601,000  , partially offset by decrease of trade payable of   $2.1 million   and a decrease of other long-term liabilities of   $76,000  .  
    
  Net cash used in operating activities was $6.5 million in the first nine months of 2015. The cash used for operating activities was a result of the net loss of $13.0 million, partially offset by cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $3.9 million, and $2.6 million of net non-cash charges. Non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $1.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.1 million, a write-down of inventory of $14,000 and a write-off of  assets of $8,000. The cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was mostly due to a decrease in inventories of $2.6 million as a result of sales of existing new product inventory, an increase in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue of$547,000, a decrease in other assets of $421,000, and an increase in trade payables of $397,000 due to the timing of payments.  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities 
        
  Net cash used in investing activities in the   nine months   of   2016   was   $1.6 million  , which was primarily driven by the capital expenditure payments associated with the EOS   TM    S3 hardware and software development and production. Capital expenditures, which are largely driven by the development of new products and manufacturing levels, are projected to be approximately   $100,000   during the remainder of   2016   fiscal year. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities in the   nine months   of   2015   was   $237,000  , which was primarily due to cash used to acquire equipment and software for the production and development of new products.

  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Continued) 

Net cash provided by financing activities 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $11.9 million   in the   nine months   of   2016  , which was primarily derived from the net proceeds of $8.8 million related to the issuance of 10.0 million shares of common stock pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with SEC, proceeds of $340,000 from the issuance of common stock under our equity plans and proceeds of $3.0 million from our line of credit, partially offset by scheduled repayments of   $259,000   for lease obligations. 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities was $136,000 in the first nine months of 2015, which was primarily derived from proceeds of $394,000 related to the issuance of common stock to employees under our equity plans, partially offset by scheduled repayments of lease obligations of $258,000. 
    
  We currently use our cash to fund capital expenditures and operating losses. Based on past operating performance and current annual operating plans, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with available financial resources from the revolving line of credit facility, and proceeds received from our sale of common stock in March 2016, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures, and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months. 
    
  The Company also believes that it will have sufficient capital to satisfy its operations and capital expenditures requirements in the long term through the sales generated from its new product offerings, existing cash and cash equivalents, financial resources from its revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank and additional capital it can raise in the public capital markets. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to raise additional capital, if required, or that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. The inability of the Company to generate sufficient sales from its new product offerings and/or raise additional capital if needed could have material adverse effects on the Company s operations and financial condition, which could further affect its ability to comply with financial covenants in the credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. 

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
    
  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of   October 2, 2016   and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future fiscal periods (in thousands): 

_________________ 
    
            (1)     
    Certain of our wafer manufacturers require us to forecast wafer starts several months in advance. We are committed to accept the delivery of and pay for a portion of forecasted wafer volume. Wafer and finished goods purchase commitments of   $2.7 million   include firm purchase commitments as of   October 2, 2016  .  
               (2)   
    Other commercial commitments are included as liabilities on our balance sheet as of   October 2, 2016  .

Concentration of Suppliers 
    
  We depend on a limited number of contract manufacturers, subcontractors, and suppliers for wafer fabrication, assembly, programming and testing, and for the supply of programming equipment. These services are typically provided by one supplier for each of our devices. We generally purchase these single or limited source services through standard purchase orders. Because we rely on independent subcontractors to perform these services, we cannot directly control product delivery schedules, costs or quality levels. Our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors. The decision not to provide these services to us or the inability to supply these services to us, such as in the case of a natural or financial disaster, would have a significant impact on our business. In addition, these subcontracted manufacturers produce products for other companies and we must place orders up to several months in advance of expected delivery. Increased demand from other companies could result in these subcontract manufacturers allocating available capacity to customers that are larger or have long-term supply contracts in place and we may be unable to obtain adequate foundry and other capacity at acceptable prices, or we may experience delays or interruption in supply. As a result, we have only a limited ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products, which could cause us to have an excess or a shortage of inventories of a particular product. Additionally, volatility of economic, market, social and political conditions in countries where these suppliers operate may be unpredictable and could result in a reduction in product revenue or increase our cost of revenue and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
   We do not maintain any off-balance sheet partnerships, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  See Note 2 to the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial condition.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate debt. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk. We are adverse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default, market risk and reinvestment risk. Our investment portfolio is generally comprised of investments that meet high credit quality standards and have active secondary and resale markets. Since these securities are subject to interest rate risk, they could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate or if the liquidity of the investment portfolio were to change. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we do not anticipate any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio. A 10% move in interest rates as of the end of the   third   quarter of   2016   would have had an immaterial effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
    
  All of our sales and costs of manufacturing are transacted in U.S. dollars. We conduct a portion of our research and development activities in India and have sales and marketing offices in several locations outside of the United States. We use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency. Most of the costs incurred at these international locations are in local currency. If these local currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar, our payroll and other local expenses will be higher than we currently anticipate. Since our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars, this negative impact on expenses would not be offset by any positive effect on revenue. Operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies were approximately   16%   of total operating expenses for the first   nine months   of   2016   and   2015  . A currency exchange rate fluctuation of 10% would have caused our operating expenses to change by approximately   $287,000   in the first   nine months   of   2016  .

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Based on management's evaluation as of   October 2, 2016  , our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance and Chief Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance and Chief Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and frauds. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  See Note 13 of the Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  Our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 3, 2016  , filed with the SEC on   March 18, 2016  , includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors at Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, which discussion is hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1A.  
    
  The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business and results from operations.
