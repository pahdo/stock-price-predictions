  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

NOTE 1.  GENERAL INFORMATION 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all information and disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.). Therefore, this information should be read in conjunction with Freeport-McMoRan Inc.'s (FCX) consolidated financial statements and notes contained in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as recast in the Form 8-K filed on   November 9, 2016  , for the presentation of TF Holdings Limited (TFHL) as discontinued operations. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods reported. With the exception of the accounting for discontinued operations, and the oil and gas properties impairment discussed below and the related tax charges to establish a deferred tax valuation allowance (refer to Note   5  ), all such adjustments are, in the opinion of management, of a normal recurring nature. As a result of FCX's second-quarter 2016 agreement to sell its interest in TFHL, FCX has reported TFHL as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the unaudited consolidated financial statements (refer to Note 2). Operating results for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  Oil and Gas Properties.   Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) full cost accounting rules, FCX reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas properties in the full cost pool for impairment each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties (net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, and related deferred income taxes) for each cost center may not exceed a  ceiling  equal to: 
             
    the present value, discounted at   10 percent  , of estimated future net cash flows from the related proved oil and gas reserves, net of estimated future income taxes; plus 
                
    the cost of the related unproved properties not being amortized; plus 
                
    the lower of cost or estimated fair value of the related unproved properties included in the costs being amortized (net of related tax effects). 
       
  These rules require that FCX price its future oil and gas production at the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials. FCX's reference prices are West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for oil and the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas. Such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. The estimated future net cash flows also exclude future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of the oil and gas properties. The rules require an impairment if the capitalized costs exceed this  ceiling.   
    
  In addition, following the evaluation of alternatives for the oil and gas business and the then-current limitations and cost of capital available for future drilling, FCX Oil   Gas LLC (FM O G, a wholly owned subsidiary of FCX formerly known as FCX Oil   Gas Inc.) determined in first-quarter 2016 that the carrying values of certain of its unevaluated properties were impaired. For the   first nine months   of   2016  , FM O G transferred   $3.2 billion   of costs (including   $3.1 billion   in first-quarter 2016) associated with unevaluated properties to the full cost pool, mostly reflecting impairment of the carrying values of unevaluated properties. Combined with the impact of the reduction in twelve-month historical prices and reserve revisions, net capitalized costs exceeded the related ceiling test limitation under full cost accounting rules, which resulted in the recognition of a   $239 million   impairment charge in   third-quarter     2016   and   $4.3 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2016  . The twelve-month average price (using WTI as the reference oil price) was   $41.68   per barrel at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $43.12   per barrel at June 30, 2016.

NOTE 2.  DISPOSITIONS 
    
  Timok.     On   May 2, 2016  , Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC), a wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, sold an interest in the Timok exploration project in Serbia to Reservoir Minerals Inc. for consideration of   $135 million   in cash and contingent consideration of up to   $107 million   payable to FCX in stages upon achievement of defined development milestones (no amounts are recorded for the contingent consideration as of   September 30, 2016  ). As a result of this transaction, FCX recorded a gain of   $133 million   in second-quarter 2016. 
    
  Morenci  .   On   May 31, 2016  , FCX sold a   13 percent   undivided interest in its Morenci unincorporated joint venture to Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. (SMM) for   $1.0 billion   in cash. FCX recorded a   $576 million   gain on the transaction and used losses to offset cash taxes on the transaction. Proceeds from the transaction were used to repay borrowings under FCX's unsecured bank term loan (Term Loan) and revolving credit facility. 
    
  The Morenci unincorporated joint venture was owned   85 percent   by FCX and   15 percent   by Sumitomo Metal Mining Arizona Inc. (Sumitomo). As a result of the transaction, the unincorporated joint venture is owned   72 percent   by FCX,   15 percent   by Sumitomo and   13 percent   by an affiliate that is wholly owned by SMM. 
    
  Oil and Gas Operations.     On   June 17, 2016  , FM O G sold certain oil and gas royalty interests to Black Stone Minerals, L.P. for cash consideration of   $102 million  , before closing adjustments. In addition, on   July 25, 2016  , FM O G sold its Haynesville shale assets for cash consideration of   $87 million  , before closing adjustments. Under the full cost accounting rules, the proceeds from these transactions were recorded as a reduction of capitalized oil and gas properties, with no gain or loss recognition. 
    
  On   September 12, 2016  , FM O G entered into an agreement to sell its Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) properties  to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) for cash consideration of   $2.0 billion   (before closing adjustments) and up to   $150 million   in contingent payments. The contingent payments would be received over time as Anadarko realizes future cash flows in connection with FM O G s third-party production handling agreement for the Marlin platform. Anadarko will assume future abandonment obligations associated with these properties. The transaction has an effective date of   August 1, 2016  , and is expected to close in   fourth-quarter 2016  , subject to customary closing conditions. Under the full cost accounting rules, this transaction will require gain (loss) recognition because of its significance to the full cost pool, but the amount is not expected to be material. In accordance with the mandatory prepayment provisions of FCX's Term Loan, one half of the proceeds from this transaction must be applied toward repaying FCX's Term Loan. 
    
  In connection with the sale of the Deepwater GOM properties, FM O G entered into an agreement to amend the terms of the Plains Offshore Operations Inc. (Plains Offshore, a subsidiary of FM O G) preferred stock that is reported as redeemable noncontrolling interest on FCX's consolidated balance sheets. The amendment provides FM O G the right to call these securities any time between September 12, 2016, and January 10, 2017, for   $582 million  . FM O G expects to exercise this option at the time the Deepwater GOM sale closes. If the option is not exercised, the terms will revert to the original purchase agreement as discussed in Note 2 of FCX's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as recast in the Form 8-K filed on   November 9, 2016  . No other terms of the Plains Offshore preferred stock were changed by this amendment. 
    
  On   October 14, 2016  , FM O G entered into an agreement to sell its onshore California oil and gas properties to Sentinel Peak Resources California LLC (Sentinel) for cash consideration of   $592 million   (before closing adjustments) and contingent consideration of up to   $150 million  , consisting of   $50 million   per year for 2018, 2019 and 2020 if the price of Brent crude oil averages   $70   per barrel or higher in each of these calendar years. Sentinel will assume future abandonment obligations associated with the properties. The transaction has an effective date of July 1, 2016, and is expected to close in fourth-quarter 2016, subject to customary closing conditions. Under the full cost accounting rules, this transaction will require gain (loss) recognition because of its significance to the full cost pool, but the amount is not expected to be material. In accordance with the mandatory prepayment provisions of FCX's Term Loan, one half of the proceeds from this transaction must be applied toward repaying FCX's Term Loan.

As part of the terms to sell the onshore California oil and gas properties, FM O G entered into derivative contracts during October 2016 for a portion of the projected sales of oil from the properties and projected purchases of natural gas. Sentinel will assume these contracts upon completion of the sale. These derivative contracts consist of crude oil swaps and costless collars, and natural gas swaps, none of which were designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The derivatives will be recorded at fair value with the mark-to-market gains and losses recorded in revenues (oil contracts) and production costs (natural gas contracts).  
  As of October 31, 2016, FM O G had hedged (i) approximately   72 percent   of its forecasted crude oil sales through 2020 with fixed-rate swaps for   19.4 million   barrels from November 2016 through December 2020 at a price of   $56.04   per barrel and costless collars for   5.2 million   barrels from January 2018 through December 2020 at a put price of   $50.00   per barrel and a call price of   $63.69   per barrel, and (ii) approximately   48 percent   of its forecasted natural gas purchases through 2020 with fixed-rate swaps for   28.9 million   British thermal units (MMBtu) from November 2016 through December 2020 at a price of   $3.1445   per MMBtu related to its onshore California properties that are being sold to Sentinel. 
    
  TF Holdings Limited - Discontinued Operations.     On   May 9, 2016  , FCX entered into a definitive agreement to sell its   70 percent   interest in TFHL to China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. (CMOC) for   $2.65 billion   in cash and contingent consideration of up to   $120 million   in cash, consisting of   $60 million   if the average copper price exceeds   $3.50   per pound and   $60 million   if the average cobalt price exceeds   $20   per pound, both during calendar years 2018 and 2019 (no amounts were recorded for the contingent consideration as of September 30, 2016). Through its interest in TFHL, FCX has an effective   56 percent   interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining S.A. (TFM or Tenke) located in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The closing of the transaction is currently subject to customary closing conditions, including the resolution of the right of first offer (which expires on   November 15, 2016  ) of Lundin Mining Corporation (which holds a   30 percent   interest in TFHL), and the parties are working towards a satisfactory resolution in order to complete the transaction in fourth-quarter 2016. In addition, La G n rale des Carri res et des Mines (G camines), which is wholly owned by the DRC government and holds a   20 percent   non-dilutable interest in TFM, recently filed an arbitration proceeding with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) International Court of Arbitration challenging the transaction; however, FCX believes that G camines  claims have no legal basis. In accordance with the mandatory prepayment provisions of FCX's Term Loan, one half of the proceeds from this transaction will be applied toward repaying FCX's Term Loan. 
    
  In accordance with accounting guidance, FCX has reported the results of operations of TFHL as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and presented the assets and liabilities of TFHL as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. The consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) were not impacted by discontinued operations as TFHL did not have any other comprehensive income (loss), and the consolidated statements of cash flows are reported on a combined basis without separately presenting discontinued operations.

Net (loss) income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following (in millions): 

b. 
    In accordance with accounting guidance, depreciation, depletion and amortization is not recognized subsequent to classification as assets held for sale. 
              c. 
    In accordance with accounting guidance, interest associated with FCX's Term Loan that will be required to be repaid as a result of the sale of TFHL has been allocated to discontinued operations. 
              d. 
    In accordance with accounting guidance, an estimated loss on disposal was recorded, which will be adjusted through closing of the transaction.  
       
  Cash flows from discontinued operations included in the consolidated statements of cash flows follow (in millions):   

FCX has also agreed to negotiate exclusively with CMOC (until December 31, 2016) to enter into a definitive agreement to sell its interest in Freeport Cobalt for   $100 million   and the Kisanfu exploration project in the DRC for   $50 million   in separate transactions. Freeport Cobalt includes the large-scale cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and the related sales and marketing business, in which FCX owns an effective   56 percent   interest. Kisanfu is a copper and cobalt exploration project, located near Tenke, in which FCX holds a   100 percent   interest.  

NOTE 3.  EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  FCX s basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders was computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share of common stock was computed using the most dilutive of (a) the two-class method or (b) the treasury stock method. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. FCX s participating securities consist of vested restricted stock units (RSUs) for which the underlying common shares are not yet issued and entitle holders to non-forfeitable dividends.

     Table of Contents                  

A reconciliation of net income (loss) and weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income (loss) per share follows (in millions, except per share amounts):  

a. 
    Excludes   6 million   shares of common stock in   third-quarter     2016  ,   7 million   in   third-quarter     2015  ,   12 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   10 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015   associated with outstanding stock options with exercise prices less than the average market price of FCX's common stock and RSUs that were anti-dilutive. 
       
  Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of FCX s common stock during the period are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock. Stock options for   46 million   shares of common stock were excluded for both the third quarter and   first nine months   of   2016  ,   48 million   in   third-quarter     2015   and   45 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015  .

NOTE 4.  INVENTORIES, INCLUDING LONG-TERM MILL AND LEACH STOCKPILES 
    
  The components of inventories follow (in millions): 

b. 
    Estimated metals in stockpiles not expected to be recovered within the next 12 months. 
       
  FCX recorded charges for adjustments to metals inventory carrying values of   $20 million   in   third-quarter   2016 and   $27 million   for   the first nine months   of 2016, primarily for molybdenum because of lower molybdenum prices and higher average inventory costs, and   $91 million   in   third-quarter   2015 and   $154 million   for   the first nine months   of 2015, primarily because of lower molybdenum and copper prices (refer to Note   10   for 2015 inventory adjustments by business segment). 

NOTE 5.  INCOME TAXES  
    
  Variations in the relative proportions of jurisdictional income result in fluctuations to FCX's consolidated effective income tax rate. FCX s consolidated effective income tax rate was   (2) percent   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   18 percent   for   the first nine months   of   2015  . Geographic sources of FCX's benefit from (provision for) income taxes follow (in millions): 

As a result of the impairment to U.S. oil and gas properties, FCX recorded tax charges of   $1.6 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $2.0 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2015   to establish a valuation allowance primarily against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets that will not generate a future benefit. In addition, FCX recorded net tax credits of   $290 million   for   the first nine months   of 2016 associated with alternative minimum tax credits, changes to valuation allowances and net operating loss carryback claims. Excluding these net charges, FCX's consolidated effective income tax rate was   32 percent   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   37 percent   for   the first nine months   of   2015  .

     Table of Contents                  

As of   December 31, 2015  , FCX had determined that undistributed earnings of TFM were reinvested indefinitely and were allocated toward specifically identifiable needs of the local operations. In connection with the announced sale of its interest in TFHL, management concluded that its share of undistributed earnings of TFM were no longer reinvested indefinitely. This change did not have a material impact on FCX's results of operations. 
    
  Applicable accounting standards require that FCX estimate an annual effective tax rate and apply that rate to each year-to-date interim period. However, because FCX s estimated effective income tax rate for 2016 is highly variable (  i.e.  , minor changes in FCX s estimated annual (loss) income would have a significant effect on the consolidated annual effective income tax rate), the actual effective income tax rate for the year-to-date reporting period represents a better estimate of the consolidated annual effective income tax rate. Accordingly, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the actual consolidated effective income tax rate was used to determine FCX s income tax provision. 

NOTE 6.  DEBT AND EQUITY  
    
  Debt.   The components of debt follow (in millions): 

On   February 26, 2016  , FCX amended its revolving credit facility and Term Loan. The amendments included (i) modification of the maximum leverage ratio and the minimum interest expense coverage ratio, and (ii) the addition of a springing collateral and guarantee trigger. In addition, the commitment under the revolving credit facility was reduced from   $4.0 billion   to   $3.5 billion  , and the mandatory prepayment provision was modified under the Term Loan, which requires one-half of proceeds from asset sales to be applied toward repaying the Term Loan. Refer to Note 18 of FCX's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as recast in the Form 8-K filed on   November 9, 2016  , for further discussion of these amendments. 
    
  In second-quarter 2016, FCX prepaid   $568 million   on the Term Loan with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the   13 percent   undivided interest in Morenci and the interest in the Timok exploration project. 
    
  With closed and pending asset sales exceeding the required   $3 billion   threshold under FCX's revolving credit facility and Term Loan as of June 30, 2016, the springing collateral requirement under these agreements was not triggered on that date. Since the closing of the transactions necessary to reach the   $3 billion   threshold is not expected to occur until fourth-quarter 2016, FCX was required to pledge its shares in FMC on June 30, 2016, which will be released upon closing of transactions necessary to reach the required threshold. If the required   $3 billion   threshold for asset sale closings has not been reached by December 31, 2016, the springing collateral requirement will be triggered.

At   September 30, 2016  , there were no borrowings outstanding and   $43 million   in letters of credit issued under FCX's revolving credit facility, resulting in availability of approximately   $3.5 billion  , of which approximately   $1.5 billion   could be used for additional letters of credit.  
    
  Early Extinguishment of Debt 
  During the second and third quarters of 2016, FCX redeemed certain senior notes in exchange for its common stock (refer to the discussion under "Equity" in this note). A summary of these debt extinguishments follows (in millions): 

In addition, FCX recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt totaling   $3 million   associated with the modifications to its Term Loan and revolving credit facility in first-quarter 2016. 
    
  Interest Expense, Net 
  Consolidated interest expense from continuing operations (excluding capitalized interest) totaled   $211 million   in both the third quarter of   2016   and   2015  ,   $647 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   $622 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Capitalized interest added to property, plant, equipment and mining development costs, net, totaled   $24 million   in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $42 million   in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $66 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   $134 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Capitalized interest added to oil and gas properties not subject to amortization totaled   $12 million   in   third-quarter     2015   (  none   in third-quarter 2016),   $7 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   $50 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
    
  Equity.   In 2015 and through January 5, 2016, FCX generated approximately   $2 billion   in gross proceeds (proceeds of   $1.97 billion   net of   $20 million   of commissions and expenses) through the sale of   210 million   shares of common stock (  206 million   shares through December 31, 2015, and   4 million   shares (with a value of   $32 million  ) in January 2016) under its 2015 at-the-market equity programs. At October 31, 2016, FCX has approximately   $12 million   remaining under these at-the-market equity programs. FCX used the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness. 
    
  On   July 27, 2016  , FCX commenced a new registered at-the-market equity offering of up to   $1.5 billion   of common stock. Through September 30, 2016, FCX sold   33.5 million   shares of its common stock at an average price of   $12.39   per share, which generated gross proceeds of   $415 million   (net proceeds of   $411 million   after   $4 million   of commissions and expenses). From October 1, 2016, through   November 8, 2016  , FCX sold   26.3 million   shares of its common stock at an average price of   $11.54   per share, which generated gross proceeds of   $304 million   (net proceeds of   $301 million   after   $3 million   of commissions and expenses). FCX will use the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness. 
    
  During second-quarter 2016, FCX issued   48 million   shares of its common stock (with a value of   $540 million  , excluding   $5 million   of commissions paid by FCX) in connection with the settlement of two drilling rig contracts (refer to Note   9   for further discussion).  
    
  During second-quarter 2016 and through August 4, 2016, FCX negotiated private exchange transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, whereby   28 million   shares of FCX's common stock were issued (with an aggregate value of   $311 million  ), in exchange for   $369 million   principal amount of FCX s senior notes.

NOTE 7.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has entered into derivative financial instruments in limited instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  
    
  Commodity Contracts.   From time to time, FCX has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent provisions. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , FCX had no price protection contracts relating to its mine production or future sales of oil and gas. In connection with the agreement to sell FM O G's onshore California properties, FCX entered into derivative contracts for oil and gas (see Note 2). A discussion of FCX s derivative contracts and programs, except for the oil and gas derivative contracts discussed in Note 2, follows. 
    
  Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments   Fair Value Hedges 
  Copper Futures and Swap Contracts.   Some of FCX s U.S. copper rod customers request a fixed market price instead of the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), a division of NYMEX, average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not have any significant gains or losses during the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. At   September 30, 2016  , FCX held copper futures and swap contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for   53 million   pounds at an average contract price of   $2.18   per pound, with maturities through   April 2018  . 
    
  A summary of gains (losses) recognized in revenues for derivative financial instruments related to commodity contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedge transactions, along with the unrealized gains (losses) on the related hedged item follows (in millions):

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
  Embedded Derivatives.   As described in Note 1 to FCX's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as recast in the Form 8-K filed on   November 9, 2016  , under  Revenue Recognition,  certain FCX copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold sales contracts provide for provisional pricing primarily based on the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper price or the COMEX copper price and the London Bullion Market Association (London) gold price at the time of shipment as specified in the contract. Similarly, FCX purchases copper under contracts that provide for provisional pricing. FCX applies the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives and hedge accounting guidance to the host sales agreements since the contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery. Sales and purchases with a provisional sales price contain an embedded derivative (  i.e.  , the price settlement mechanism is settled after the time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host contract is the sale or purchase of the metals contained in the concentrate or cathode at the then-current LME or COMEX copper price or the London gold price as defined in the contract. Mark-to-market price fluctuations from these embedded derivatives related to continuing operations are recorded through the settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales contracts and in cost of sales as production and delivery costs for purchase contracts. Mark-to-market price fluctuations associated with embedded derivatives for discontinued operations, which were minimal, are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in these financial statements. 
    
  A summary of FCX s embedded derivatives at   September 30, 2016  , follows:  

Crude Oil Contracts.   As a result of the acquisition of the oil and gas business, FCX had derivative contracts in 2015 that consisted of crude oil options. These derivatives were not designated as hedging instruments and were recorded at fair value with the mark-to-market gains and losses recorded in revenues. The crude oil options were entered into to protect the realized price of a portion of expected future sales in order to limit the effects of crude oil price decreases. The remaining contracts matured in 2015.  
    
  Copper Forward Contracts.   Atlantic Copper, FCX's wholly owned smelting and refining unit in Spain, enters into copper forward contracts designed to hedge its copper price risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not match. These economic hedge transactions are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices, with the mark-to-market hedging gains or losses recorded in cost of sales. At   September 30, 2016  , Atlantic Copper held net copper forward purchase contracts for   10 million   pounds at an average contract price of   $2.17   per pound, with maturities through   November 2016  . 
    
  Summary of Gains (Losses).   A summary of the realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized in FCX's income (loss) before income taxes and equity in affiliated companies  net earnings (losses) for commodity contracts that do not qualify as hedge transactions, including embedded derivatives, follows (in millions):

FCX's commodity contracts have netting arrangements with counterparties with which the right of offset exists, and it is FCX's policy to offset balances by counterparty on its balance sheet. FCX's embedded derivatives on provisional sales/purchases are netted with the corresponding outstanding receivable/payable balances. A summary of these unsettled commodity contracts that are offset in the balance sheet follows (in millions):

     Table of Contents                  

Credit Risk.   FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial institutions with which FCX has entered into derivative transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. FCX does not anticipate that any of the counterparties it deals with will default on their obligations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum amount of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions was   $48 million  . 
    
  Other Financial Instruments.   Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,  restricted cash, investment securities, legally restricted funds, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and long-term debt. The carrying value for cash and cash equivalents (which included time deposits of   $58 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $34 million   at December 31, 2015), accounts receivable, restricted cash, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value because of their short-term nature and generally negligible credit losses (refer to Note   8   for the fair values of investment securities, legally restricted funds and long-term debt). 
    
  In addition, FCX has contingent liabilities related to the settlement of FM O G's drilling rig contracts (refer to Note   8   for the fair value and Note   9   for further discussion of these instruments).

Table of Contents                  

NOTE 8.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
    
  Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  
    
  FCX recognizes transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period. FCX did not have any significant transfers in or out of Level 1, 2 or 3 for   third  -quarter   2016  .  
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, FCX retrospectively adopted the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) associated with investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient. As a result, investments valued using NAV per share are shown in the tables below in a column separate from the levels within the fair value hierarchy. A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of FCX s financial instruments, other than cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities (refer to Note   7  ) follows (in millions):

     Table of Contents                  

Valuation Techniques.   Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. 
    
  Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  
    
  Fixed income securities (government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds) are valued using a bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. A bid-evaluation price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  FCX s embedded derivatives on provisional copper concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales are valued using only quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper forward prices and the London gold forward price at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note   7   for further discussion); however, FCX's contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange. As a result, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
    
  FCX s derivative financial instruments for copper futures and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted monthly COMEX or LME prices at each reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to Note   7   for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX and LME forward prices.  
    
  Contingent liabilities for the settlement of drilling rig contracts (refer to Note 9 for further discussion) are based on the average price forecasts of WTI crude oil over the 12-month period ending June 30, 2017. The fair value is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses various observable inputs, including WTI crude oil forward prices, volatilities, discount rate and settlement terms. As a result, these contingent liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Long-term debt, including current portion, is valued using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The U.S. core fixed income fund is valued at NAV. The fund strategy seeks total return consisting of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions (usually within one business day of notice). 
    
  The techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the techniques used at   September 30, 2016  . 

NOTE 9.  CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  
    
  Litigation.   During third-quarter 2016, there were no significant updates to previously reported legal proceedings included in Note 12 of FCX's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as recast in the Form 8-K filed on   November 9, 2016  . 
    
  Tax and Other Matters 
  Cerro Verde Royalty Dispute 
  As reported in Note 12 of FCX s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as recast in the Form 8-K filed on   November 9, 2016  , SUNAT, the Peru national tax authority, has assessed mining royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator, which commenced operations in late 2006, for the period December 2006 to December 2007 and the years 2008 and 2009. In April 2016, SUNAT issued assessments for the year 2010 and the period January 2011 to September 2011. Cerro Verde has contested the assessments, of which  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents                  

the aggregate amount covering the period December 2006 to September 2011 totals   $430 million   (based on the exchange rate as of September 30, 2016), including estimated accumulated interest and penalties. Additionally, in April 2016, Peru s Twentieth Contentious Administrative Court, which specializes in taxation matters, rendered its decision upholding the Peru Tax Tribunal s July 2013 decision affirming SUNAT s assessments for the period December 2006 through December 2007. On May 2, 2016, Cerro Verde appealed this decision to Peru s Twentieth Contentious Administrative Court. 
    
  SUNAT may make additional assessments for mining royalties and associated penalties and interest for the period from October 2011 through December 2013, which Cerro Verde will contest. As of September 30, 2016, FCX estimates the total exposure associated with these mining royalties for the period from December 2006 through December 2013 approximates   $537 million   (based on the exchange rate as of September 30, 2016), including estimated accumulated interest and penalties. No amounts have been accrued for these assessments as of September 30, 2016, because Cerro Verde believes its 1998 stability agreement exempts it from these royalties and believes any payments will be recoverable. 
    
  Other Peru Tax Matters 
  There were no significant changes to other Peru tax matters during third-quarter 2016 (refer to Note 12 of FCX s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as recast in the Form 8-K filed on   November 9, 2016  , for further discussion of these matters). 
    
  Indonesia Tax Matters 
  The following information includes a discussion of updates to previously reported Indonesia tax matters included in Note 12 of FCX s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as recast in the Form 8-K filed on   November 9, 2016  . 
    
  In December 2009, PT-FI was notified by Indonesian tax authorities that it was obligated to pay value-added taxes on certain goods imported after the year 2000. In December 2014, PT-FI paid   $269 million   for valued-added taxes for the period from November 2005 through the year 2009 and sought a refund. In March 2016, PT-FI collected a cash refund of   $196 million   and   $38 million   was offset against other tax liabilities. The remaining balance of the amount originally paid was reduced by currency exchange and other losses.  
    
  Required estimated income tax payments for 2014 significantly exceeded PT-FI s 2014 reported income tax liability, which resulted in a   $284 million   overpayment. During second-quarter 2016, the Indonesian tax authorities issued tax assessments for 2014 of   $156 million   and agreed to refund   $128 million   associated with income tax overpayments made by PT-FI in 2014. PT-FI filed objections for   $152 million   of the tax assessments in third-quarter 2016.  
    
  PT-FI received assessments from the local regional tax authority in Papua, Indonesia, for additional taxes and penalties related to surface water taxes for the period from January 2011 through August 2016. PT-FI has filed or will file objections to these assessments. The local government of Papua rejected PT-FI s objections to the assessments related to the period from January 2011 through April 2016, and PT-FI has filed or will file appeals with the Indonesia Tax Court. The aggregate amount of all assessments received through September 30, 2016, including penalties, was   3.0 trillion   Indonesian rupiah (  $231 million   based on the exchange rate as of September 30, 2016). Additional penalties, which could be significant, may be assessed depending on the outcome of the appeals process.   No   amounts have been accrued for these assessments as of September 30, 2016, because PT-FI believes its Contract of Work (COW) exempts it from these payments and that it has the right to contest these assessments in the Indonesia Tax Court and ultimately the Indonesia Supreme Court.  
    
  Indonesia Mining Contract.   There were no significant updates related to PT-FI's COW during third-quarter 2016 (refer to Note 13 of FCX s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as recast in the Form 8-K filed on   November 9, 2016  , for further discussion). 
  In August 2016, PT-FI's export permit was renewed through   January 11, 2017  , and the Indonesian government continues to impose a five percent export duty while it reviews PT-FI's smelter development plans. Current regulations published by the Indonesian government prohibit exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes after January 12, 2017. Indonesian government officials have indicated an intent to revise this regulation to protect employment and government revenues. The nature of any potential revisions of the regulation is currently uncertain. PT-FI is actively engaged with Indonesian government officials on this matter.

Other.   During second-quarter 2016, FCX negotiated the termination and settlement of FM O G's drilling rig contracts with Noble Drilling (U.S.) LLC (Noble) and Rowan Companies plc (Rowan). Under the settlement with Noble, FCX issued   48 million   shares of its common stock (representing a value of   $540 million  ) during second-quarter 2016, and Noble immediately sold these shares. Under the settlement with Rowan, FCX paid   $85 million   in cash during second-quarter 2016 and FCX paid the remaining   $130 million   during third-quarter 2016. FCX also agreed to provide contingent payments of up to   $75 million   to Noble and   $30 million   to Rowan, depending on the average price of crude oil over the 12-month period ending June 30, 2017. The fair value of these contingent payments totaled   $18 million   as of   September 30, 2016   (refer to Note   8  ). As a result of the settlements, FM O G was released from a total of   $1.1 billion   in payment obligations under its three drilling rig contracts. 

NOTE 10.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
    
  FCX has organized its continuing mining operations into four primary divisions   North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. For oil and gas operations, FCX determines its operating segments on a country-by-country basis. Separately disclosed in the following table are FCX's reportable segments, which include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg copper mines, the Rod   Refining operations, the Atlantic Copper Smelting   Refining operation and U.S. Oil   Gas operations.  
  FCX's reportable segments previously included Africa mining, which consisted of the Tenke mine located in the DRC. As discussed in Note 2, FCX has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its interest in TFHL, and as a result, Tenke has been removed from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  
  On May 31, 2016, FCX completed the sale of an additional   13 percent   undivided interest in the Morenci unincorporated joint venture. As a result, FCX's undivided interest in Morenci was prospectively reduced from   85 percent   to   72 percent  .     
    
  Intersegment sales between FCX s mining operations are based on similar arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums. In addition, intersegment sales from Tenke to FCX's other consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in discontinued operations (refer to Note 2). 
    
  FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mines to other divisions, including Atlantic Copper (FCX's wholly owned smelter and refinery in Spain) and on   25 percent   of PT-FI's sales to PT Smelting (PT-FI's   25 percent  -owned smelter and refinery in Indonesia), until final sales to third parties occur. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices result in variability in FCX's net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. 
  FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other   Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, most mining exploration and research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and those costs, along with some selling, general and administrative costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual segments. Accordingly, the following segment information reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity.

NOTE 12.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
    
  In May 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an ASU that removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016, and the prior period disclosures have been restated to remove these investments from the levels within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note   8  ). 
    
  In January 2016, FASB issued an ASU that amends the current guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. This ASU makes limited changes to existing guidance and amends certain disclosure requirements. For public entities, this ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted, except for the provision on recording fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option. FCX is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its financial reporting and disclosures, but at this time does not expect the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on its financial statements. 
  In February 2016, FASB issued an ASU that will require lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. This ASU allows lessees to make an accounting policy election to not recognize a lease asset and liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less and do not have a purchase option that is expected to be exercised. For public entities, this ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. This ASU must be applied using the modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. FCX is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial statements. 
  In March 2016, FASB issued an ASU that simplifies various aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, statutory tax withholding requirements, an accounting policy election for forfeitures and the classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, this ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Each of the amendments in this ASU provides specific transition requirements. FCX expects to adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2017, and does not expect adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements. 
  In June 2016, FASB issued an ASU that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, and will also require expanded disclosures. For public entities, this ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The provisions of the ASU must be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. FCX is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its financial statements. 
   
  NOTE 13.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
    
  On   October 14, 2016  , FM O G entered into an agreement to sell its onshore California oil and gas properties. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion. 
    
  FCX evaluated events after   September 30, 2016  , and through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued, and determined any events or transactions occurring during this period that would require recognition or disclosure are appropriately addressed in these consolidated financial statements.

REVIEW REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF 
  FREEPORT-McMoRan INC. 
    
  We have reviewed the consolidated balance sheet of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. as of September 30, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the     three  - and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the consolidated statement of equity for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. 
    
  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
    
  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. as of   December 31, 2015  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, cash flows and equity for the year then ended (not presented herein) and we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements in our report dated February 26, 2016, except for Note 2, as to which the date is November 9, 2016. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. as of December 31, 2015, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Item 2. 
       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

In Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "we," "us" and "our" refer to Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) and its consolidated subsidiaries. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our financial statements, the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the discussion of our Business and Properties in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as recast in the Form 8-K filed on   November 9, 2016  , for the presentation of TF Holdings Limited (TFHL) as discontinued operations. The results of operations reported and summarized below are not necessarily indicative of future operating results (refer to "Cautionary Statement" for further discussion). References to "Notes" are Notes included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, all references to earnings or losses per share are on a diluted basis. Additionally, in accordance with accounting guidelines, TFHL, through which we hold an interest in the Tenke Fungurume (Tenke) mine, is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. 
    
  OVERVIEW 
    
  We are a premier U.S.-based natural resources company with an industry-leading global portfolio of mineral assets. We are the world's largest publicly traded copper producer. Our portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits, and significant mining operations in the Americas, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in North America and the Cerro Verde operation in South America. 
    
  Net income (loss) attributable to common stock totaled   $217 million   in third-quarter 2016 and   $(4.4) billion   for the first nine months of 2016, compared with   $(3.8) billion   in third-quarter 2015 and   $(8.2) billion   for the first nine months of 2015. The   third   quarter and first nine months of   2016  , compared with the 2015 periods, benefited from lower charges for the impairment of oil and gas properties and higher copper sales volumes, partly offset by lower copper price realizations. The first nine months of 2016 also reflected net gains on sales of assets, mostly offset by net charges associated with the termination and settlements of drilling rig contracts. Refer to  Consolidated Results  for further discussion. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.1 billion   in consolidated cash and cash equivalents and   $19.0 billion   in total debt. We had no borrowings and   $3.5 billion   available under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. Refer to Note   6   for further discussion of debt. 
    
  We are taking actions to strengthen our balance sheet through a combination of asset sale transactions, cash flow from operations and capital market transactions. During 2016, we have announced $6.6 billion in asset sale transactions and have received aggregate cash consideration of $1.4 billion. The remaining $5.2 billion in gross proceeds associated with the pending sale of our interest in TFHL and the sales of our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and onshore California oil and gas properties is expected to be received in fourth-quarter 2016. As further discussed in Note 2, we have entered into agreements to sell (i) our Deepwater GOM properties for cash consideration of   $2.0 billion   (before closing adjustments) and up to   $150 million   in contingent payments, (ii) our onshore California oil and gas properties for cash consideration of $592 million (before closing adjustments) and up to $150 million of contingent consideration and (iii) our interest in TFHL for $2.65 billion and contingent consideration of up to $120 million. In connection with the sale of the Deepwater GOM properties, Freeport McMoRan Oil   Gas LLC (FM O G) entered into an agreement to amend the terms of the Plains Offshore Operations Inc. (Plains Offshore) preferred stock to provide FM O G the option to call these securities for $582 million, which FM O G expects to exercise at the time the Deepwater GOM sale closes. 
    
  In July 2016, we commenced a registered at-the-market offering of up to $1.5 billion of common stock. Through   November 8, 2016  ,   we have sold 59.8 million shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $719 million ($12.02 per share average price)  . Additionally, through August 4, 2016, FCX redeemed $369 million in senior notes (including $101 million in third-quarter 2016) for 28 million shares of its common stock in a series of privately negotiated transactions. Refer to Note   6   for further discussion.  
    
  During second-quarter 2016, we terminated contracts for FM O G's deepwater drillships, and settled aggregate commitments totaling $1.1 billion for $755 million, of which $540 million was funded with shares of our common stock. We also agreed to provide contingent payments of up to $105 million, depending on the average price of crude oil over the 12-month period ending June 30, 2017. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion.

     Table of Contents                  

FCX continues to aggressively manage production, exploration and administrative costs and capital spending. With the successful completion of the Cerro Verde expansion and anticipated access to higher grade ore from the Grasberg mine in future quarters, we expect to generate cash flows for debt reduction. 
    
  We remain focused on our high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to generate value as market conditions improve. In addition to debt reduction plans, we are pursuing opportunities to create additional value through mine designs that would increase copper reserves, reduce costs and provide opportunities to enhance net present values, and we continue to advance studies for future development of our copper resources, the timing of which will be dependent on market conditions.  

OUTLOOK 
    
  We view the long-term outlook for our business positively, supported by limitations on supplies of copper and by the requirements for copper in the world s economy. Our financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in market prices, primarily for copper, gold, molybdenum and oil, as well as other factors. World market prices for these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Because we cannot control the price of our products, the key measures that management focuses on in operating our business are sales volumes, unit net cash costs for our mining operations, cash production costs per barrel of oil equivalents (BOE) for our oil and gas operations, operating cash flow and capital expenditures.  
    
  Projections and other forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q assume a resolution with respect to Indonesian regulations prohibiting exports of concentrate and anode slimes after January 12, 2017 (refer to "Operations   Indonesia Mining" for further discussion).  
    
  Sales Volumes    
  Following are our projected consolidated sales volumes for the year   2016  : 

a. 
    Projected molybdenum sales include   23 million   pounds produced by our Molybdenum mines and   50 million   pounds produced by our North and South America copper mines. 
       
  Consolidated sales volumes for fourth-quarter   2016   (excluding 120 million pounds of copper for Tenke) are expected to approximate 1.2 billion pounds of copper,   590 thousand   ounces of gold,   21 million   pounds of molybdenum and 11.5 MMBOE. Projected sales volumes are dependent on a number of factors, including operational performance, shipping schedules and the completion of pending asset sale transactions. For other important factors that could cause results to differ materially from projections, refer to "Cautionary Statement" and Part II, Item IA. "Risk Factors." 
    
  Mining Unit Net Cash Costs    
  Assuming average prices of   $1,250   per ounce of gold and   $7   per pound of molybdenum for fourth-quarter   2016   and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for our copper mines (both including and excluding Tenke) are expected to average   $1.20   per pound of copper for the year   2016  . The impact of price changes for fourth-quarter   2016   on consolidated unit net cash costs would approximate   $0.0075   per pound for each   $50   per ounce change in the average price of gold and   $0.004   per pound for each   $2   per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. Quarterly unit net cash costs vary with fluctuations in sales volumes and realized prices primarily for gold and molybdenum. Refer to  Consolidated Results

Production and Delivery Costs  for further discussion of consolidated production and delivery costs for our mining operations.  
    
  Oil and Gas Cash Production Costs per BOE 
  Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, cash production costs for our oil and gas operations are expected to approximate   $16.00   per BOE for the year   2016  . Refer to  Operations   Oil and Gas  for further discussion of oil and gas production costs. 
    
  Consolidated Operating Cash Flow 
  Our consolidated operating cash flows vary with volumes, prices realized from copper, gold, molybdenum and oil sales, production costs, income taxes, other working capital changes and other factors. Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming average prices of   $2.10   per pound of copper,   $1,250   per ounce of gold,   $7   per pound of molybdenum and   $51   per barrel of Brent crude oil for fourth-quarter   2016  , consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to approximate   $3.6 billion   for the year 2016 (including   $0.3 billion   in working capital sources and other tax payments). Projected consolidated operating cash flows for the year 2016 also reflect an estimated income tax provision of $0.5 billion, primarily associated with income from our international mining operations (refer to "Consolidated Results - Income Taxes" for further discussion of our projected income tax rate for the year 2016). The impact of price changes during fourth-quarter   2016   on operating cash flows would approximate   $150 million   for each   $0.10   per pound change in the average price of copper,   $20 million   for each   $50   per ounce change in the average price of gold,   $15 million   for each   $2   per pound change in the average price of molybdenum and   $28 million   for each   $5   per barrel change in the average price of Brent crude oil. 
    
  Consolidated Capital Expenditures    
  Consolidated capital expenditures are expected to approximate   $2.8 billion   for the year 2016, consisting of   $1.6 billion   for mining operations (including   $1.2 billion   for major projects, primarily for the development of underground mines by PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) and for the Cerro Verde expansion, which was completed earlier in the year) and   $1.2 billion   for oil and gas operations.

MARKETS 
    
  Metals 
  World prices for copper, gold and molybdenum can fluctuate significantly. During the period from January 2006 through   October 2016  , the London Metal Exchange (LME) spot copper price varied from a low of   $1.26   per pound in 2008 to a record high of   $4.60   per pound in 2011; the London Bullion Market Association (London) PM gold price fluctuated from a low of   $525   per ounce in 2006 to a record high of   $1,895   per ounce in 2011; and the   Metals Week   Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price ranged from a low of   $4.46   per pound in 2015 to a high of   $33.88   per pound in 2008. Copper, gold and molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control as described further in  Risk Factors  contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

This graph presents LME spot copper prices and the combined reported stocks of copper at the LME, Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), a division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and the Shanghai Futures Exchange from January 2006 through   October 2016  . Since mid-2014, copper prices have declined because of concerns about slowing growth rates in China, a stronger U.S. dollar and a broad-based decline in commodity prices. During   third-quarter     2016  , LME spot copper prices ranged from a low of   $2.07   per pound to a high of   $2.25   per pound, averaged   $2.16   per pound, and closed at   $2.19   per pound on   September 30, 2016  . The LME spot copper price was   $2.19   per pound on   October 31, 2016  . 
    
  We believe the underlying long-term fundamentals of the copper business remain positive, supported by the significant role of copper in the global economy and a challenging long-term supply environment attributable to difficulty in replacing output of existing large mines with new production sources. Future copper prices are expected to be volatile and are likely to be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, as well as economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of the development of new supplies of copper, and production levels of mines and copper smelters.

b. 
    Reflects per pound weighted-average production and delivery costs and unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for all copper mines (excluding Tenke), before net noncash and other costs. Including Tenke, mining unit net cash costs averaged   $1.14   per pound in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $1.52   per pound in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $1.28   per pound for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $1.56   per pound for   the first nine months   of   2015  . For reconciliations of per pound unit costs by operating division to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements, refer to "Product Revenues and Production Costs." 
              c. 
    Cash operating margin for oil and gas operations reflects realized revenues less cash production costs. Cash production costs exclude accretion and other costs. For reconciliations of realized revenues and cash production costs per BOE to revenues and production and delivery costs reported in our consolidated financial statements, refer to "Product Revenues and Production Costs." 
        
  Revenues 
  Consolidated revenues totaled   $3.9 billion   in   third-quarter     2016   and   $10.5 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   $3.4 billion   in   third-quarter     2015   and   $11.1 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2015  . Revenues from our mining operations primarily include the sale of copper concentrate, copper cathode, copper rod, gold and molybdenum. During     the first nine months   of   2016  , our mined copper (excluding volumes from Tenke) was sold   56 percent   in concentrate,   22 percent   as cathode and   22 percent   as rod from North America operations. Revenues from our oil and gas operations include the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). During   the first nine months   of   2016  , approximately 90 percent of our oil and gas revenues were from oil and NGLs.

     Table of Contents                  

Following is a summary of changes in our consolidated revenues between periods (in millions): 

Mining Operations 
  Sales Volumes.   Consolidated copper sales increased to   1.1 billion   pounds in   third-quarter     2016   and   3.1 billion   pounds for   the first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   888 million   pounds in   third-quarter     2015   and   2.6 billion   pounds for   the first nine months   of   2015  , primarily reflecting higher volumes from Cerro Verde and PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI).  
    
  Consolidated gold sales volumes totaled   317 thousand   ounces in   third-quarter     2016  ,   294 thousand   ounces in   third-quarter     2015  ,   674 thousand   ounces for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   909 thousand   ounces for   the first nine months   of   2015  . Lower gold sales volumes in the first nine months of 2016, compared with the 2015 period, primarily reflects lower ore grades at PT-FI. 
    
  Consolidated molybdenum sales volumes decreased to   16 million   pounds in   third-quarter     2016   and   52 million   pounds for   the first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   23 million   pounds in   third-quarter     2015   and   69 million   pounds for   the first nine months   of   2015  , primarily reflecting weak demand. 
    
  Refer to  Operations  for further discussion of sales volumes at our mining operations. 
    
  Metals Realized Prices.   Our consolidated revenues can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum, and to a lesser extent silver.   Third-quarter     2016   average realized prices, compared with   third-quarter     2015  , were 8 percent lower for copper, 19 percent higher for gold and 16 percent higher for molybdenum. Average realized prices for   the first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   the first nine months   of   2015  , were 15 percent lower for copper, 12 percent higher for gold and 9 percent lower for molybdenum. Refer to "Markets" for further discussion.  
    
  Provisionally Priced Copper Sales.   Impacts of net adjustments for prior period provisionally priced sales primarily relate to copper sales. Substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based primarily on quoted LME monthly average spot copper prices. We receive market prices based on prices in the specified future period, which results in price fluctuations recorded through revenues until the date of settlement. We record revenues and invoice customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME prices, which results in an embedded derivative on our provisionally priced concentrate and cathode sales that is adjusted to fair value through earnings  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents                  

each period, using the period-end forward prices, until final pricing on the date of settlement. To the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising copper prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper prices, the opposite occurs. (Unfavorable) favorable impacts of net adjustments to prior periods' provisionally priced copper sales from continuing operations totaled   $(15) million   for   third-quarter     2016   and   $5 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   $(117) million   for   third-quarter     2015   and   $(100) million   for   the first nine months   of   2015  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had provisionally priced copper sales at our copper mining operations (excluding Tenke) totaling   521 million   pounds of copper (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average of   $2.20   per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. We estimate that each $0.05 change in the price realized from the   September 30, 2016  , provisional price recorded would have an approximate   $17 million   effect on   2016   net loss attributable to common stock. The LME spot copper price was   $2.19   per pound on October 31, 2016.  
    
  Treatment Charges.   Revenues from our South America and Indonesia concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment charges.  Higher treatment charges for the 2016 periods, compared with the 2015 periods, primarily reflect higher sales volumes from our Cerro Verde and PT-FI mining operations. 
    
  Purchased Copper.   We purchase copper cathode primarily for processing by our Rod   Refining operations. Purchased copper volumes of   61 million   pounds in   third-quarter     2016   and   131 million   pounds for   the first nine months   of   2016   were higher than purchased volumes of   28 million   pounds in   third-quarter     2015   and   92 million   pounds for   the first nine months   of   2015  . 
    
  Atlantic Copper Revenues.   Atlantic Copper revenues totaled $445 million in   third-quarter     2016  , $439 million in   third-quarter     2015  , $1.4 billion for the   first nine months   of   2016   and $1.5 billion for the   first nine months   of   2015  . Revenues for the 2016 periods, compared with the 2015 periods, reflect lower copper prices and higher sales volumes.  
    
  Oil and Gas Operations 
  Oil Sales Volumes.   Oil sales volumes of   9.1 million   barrels (MMBbls) in   third-quarter     2016   and   26.1   MMBbls for   the first nine months   of   2016   were lower than oil sales volumes of   9.3   MMBbls in   third-quarter     2015   and   26.3   MMBbls for   the first nine months   of   2015  , primarily reflecting lower volumes from California. 
    
  Realized Oil Prices Excluding Derivative Contracts.   The average realized price for oil of   $40.63   per barrel in   third-quarter     2016   was 9 percent lower than our average realized price of   $44.85   per barrel in   third-quarter     2015   (excluding cash gains on derivative contracts). Our average realized price for oil of   $37.11   per barrel for   the first nine months   of   2016   was 23 percent lower than our average realized price of   $48.34   per barrel for   the first nine months   of   2015   (excluding cash gains on derivative contracts). 
  Crude Oil Derivative Contracts.   During 2015, we had crude oil derivative contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments; accordingly, they were recorded at fair value with the mark-to-market gains and losses recorded in revenues each period. Net mark-to-market gains on crude oil derivative contracts totaled   $29 million   (consisting of cash gains of   $103 million  , partly offset by net noncash mark-to-market losses of   $74 million  ) in   third-quarter     2015   and   $87 million   (consisting of cash gains of   $304 million  , partly offset by net noncash mark-to-market losses of   $217 million  ) for   the first nine months   of   2015  .  
    
  Production and Delivery Costs 
  Consolidated production and delivery costs totaled   $2.5 billion   in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $2.6 billion   in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $8.0 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $7.9 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2015  . Production and delivery costs for mining operations were $603 million lower for   the first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   the first nine months   of   2015  , primarily reflecting the impact of cost reduction initiatives. Production and delivery costs for our U.S. oil and gas operations were $670 million higher for   the first nine months   of   2016   compared with the first nine months of 2015, primarily reflecting higher charges for drillship settlements/idle rig costs, which totaled   $823 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $13 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015  , partly offset by the impact of cost reduction efforts.

     Table of Contents                  

Mining Unit Site Production and Delivery Costs.   Site production and delivery costs for our copper mining operations primarily include labor, energy and commodity-based inputs, such as sulphuric acid, reagents, liners, tires and explosives. Consolidated unit site production and delivery costs (before net noncash and other costs) for our copper mines (excluding Tenke) totaled   $1.37   per pound of copper in   third-quarter     2016   and   $1.42   per pound for   the first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   $1.75   per pound in   third-quarter     2015   and   $1.88   per pound for   the first nine months   of   2015  . Lower consolidated unit site production and delivery costs for the   2016   periods, compared with the   2015   periods, primarily reflect higher volumes and the impact of ongoing cost reduction initiatives. Refer to  Operations   Unit Net Cash Costs  for further discussion of unit net cash costs associated with our operating divisions and to  Product Revenues and Production Costs  for reconciliations of per pound costs by operating division to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Oil and Gas Cash Production Costs per BOE.   Production costs for our oil and gas operations primarily include costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, such as lease operating expenses, steam gas costs, electricity, production and ad valorem taxes, and gathering and transportation expenses. Lower cash production costs for our oil and gas operations of   $15.00   per BOE in   third-quarter     2016   and   $15.28   per BOE for   the first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   $18.85   per BOE in   third-quarter     2015   and   $19.42   per BOE for   the first nine months   of   2015  , primarily reflect ongoing cost reduction efforts. Refer to  Operations - Oil and Gas  for further discussion of cash production costs at our oil and gas operations. 
    
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 
  Depreciation will vary under the unit-of-production (UOP) method as a result of changes in sales volumes and the related UOP rates at our mining and oil and gas operations. Consolidated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) totaled   $643 million   in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $823 million   in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $1.9 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $2.5 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2015  . DD A from mining operations was $47 million higher in   third-quarter     2016   and $184 million higher for   the first nine months   of   2016  , compared with the   2015   periods, primarily reflecting higher copper sales volumes from Cerro Verde and PT-FI. DD A from U.S. oil and gas operations was $227 million lower in   third-quarter     2016   and $769 million lower for   the first nine months   of   2016  , compared with the   2015   periods, primarily reflecting lower DD A rates as a result of reduced oil and gas property costs subject to amortization following impairment charges. 
    
  Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties 
  Under full cost accounting rules, a "ceiling test" is conducted each quarter to review the carrying value of oil and gas properties for impairment, which resulted in the recognition of impairment charges totaling   $239 million   in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $3.7 billion   in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $4.3 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $9.4 billion   for   the first nine months   of   2015  . Refer to Note 1 and "Operations - Oil and Gas" for further discussion. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses totaled   $110 million   in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $122 million   in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $408 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $421 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015  . Selling, general and administrative expenses includes net restructuring-related charges of   $38 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016   associated with our oil and gas operations.  
    
  Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were net of capitalized general and administrative expenses at our oil and gas operations totaling $16 million in   third-quarter     2016  , $27 million in   third-quarter     2015  , $66 million for   the first nine months   of   2016   and $97 million for   the first nine months   of   2015  .  
    
  Mining Exploration and Research Expenses 
  Consolidated exploration and research expenses for our mining operations totaled   $13 million   in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $26 million   in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $46 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $83 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015  . Our mining exploration activities are generally associated with our existing mines focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity. Exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North and South America. Exploration spending continues to be constrained by market conditions and is expected to approximate   $45 million   for the year   2016  .  
    
  Exploration costs for our oil and gas operations are capitalized to oil and gas properties.

  Environmental obligation costs reflect net revisions to our long-term environmental obligations, which vary from period to period because of changes to environmental laws and regulations, the settlement of environmental matters and/or circumstances affecting our operations that could result in significant changes in our estimates. Shutdown costs include care-and-maintenance costs and any litigation, remediation or related expenditures associated with closed facilities or operations. Net (credits) charges for environmental obligations and shutdown costs from continuing operations totaled   $(3) million   in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $37 million   in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $18 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $61 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015  .  
    
  Net Gain on Sales of Assets 
  Net gain on sales of assets totaled   $13 million   in   third-quarter     2016   and   $762 million   for the   the first nine months   of   2016  , primarily associated with the Morenci and Timok transactions (refer to Note 2 for further discussion). Net gain on sales of assets totaled   $39 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015   related to the sale of our interest in the Luna Energy power facility.  
    
  Interest Expense, Net 
  Consolidated interest expense (excluding capitalized interest and interest expense allocated to discontinued operations) totaled   $211 million   in both   third-quarter     2016   and   2015  ,   $647 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $622 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015  . Refer to Note   2   for interest allocated to discontinued operations. 
    
  Capitalized interest varies with the level of expenditures for our development projects and average interest rates on our borrowings and totaled   $24 million   in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $54 million   in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $73 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $184 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015  .  
    
  Net Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
  Net gain on early extinguishment of debt totaled   $15 million   in   third-quarter     2016   and   $51 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016  , primarily related to the redemption of certain senior notes in exchange for common stock. Refer to Note   6   for further discussion.  
    
  Income Taxes 
  Following is a summary of the approximate amounts used in the calculation of our consolidated income tax benefit  
  (provision) from continuing operations for the first nine months of   2016   and   2015   (in millions, except percentages): 

a. 
    Represents income (loss) from continuing operations by geographic location before income taxes and equity in affiliated companies  net earnings (losses). 
              b. 
    Includes net tax credits of   $290 million   for the   first nine months   of   2016   primarily associated with alternative minimum tax credits, changes to valuation allowances and net operating loss carryback claims. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion. 
              c. 
    Includes a gain of $92 million related to net proceeds received from insurance carriers and other third parties related to the shareholder derivative litigation settlement for which there was no related tax provision. 
              d. 
    As a result of the impairment to U.S. oil and gas properties, we recorded tax charges to establish valuation allowances against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets that will not generate a future benefit. 
              e. 
    In accordance with applicable accounting rules, we adjust our interim provision for income taxes to equal our consolidated tax rate.

f. 
    The consolidated effective income tax rate is a function of the combined effective tax rates for the jurisdictions in which we operate. Accordingly, variations in the relative proportions of jurisdictional income result in fluctuations to our consolidated effective income tax rate. Assuming achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and average prices of   $2.10   per pound for copper,   $1,250   per ounce for gold,   $7   per pound for molybdenum and   $51   per barrel of Brent crude oil for fourth-quarter   2016  , we estimate our consolidated effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the year 2016 will approximate   40 percent  , excluding U.S. domestic losses. 
       
  Net (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations 
  In May 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in TFHL, through which we have an effective 56 percent interest in the Tenke copper and cobalt mining concessions in the Southeast region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In accordance with accounting guidelines, the results of Tenke have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Net (loss) income from discontinued operations totaled   $(6) million   in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $25 million   in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $(191) million   for   the first nine months   of   2016   and   $95 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015  . The 2016 periods also include an estimated loss on disposal of   $5 million   for   third-quarter     2016   and   $182 million   for   the first nine months   of   2016  , which will be adjusted through closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 2 for a summary of the components of discontinued operations and to "Discontinued Operations" for a discussion of operating results.  

OPERATIONS 
    
  North America Copper Mines 
  We operate seven open-pit copper mines in North America   Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. All of the North America mining operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci.  
    
  We record our undivided joint venture interest in Morenci using the proportionate consolidation method. On May 31, 2016, we completed the sale of an additional 13 percent undivided interest in Morenci for $1.0 billion in cash. As a result of the transaction, our undivided interest in Morenci was prospectively reduced from 85 percent to 72 percent. Refer to Note   2   for further discussion.  
    
  The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and solution extraction/electrowinning (SX/EW) operations. A majority of the copper produced at our North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by our Rod   Refining segment. The remainder of our North America copper sales is in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate, a portion of which is shipped to Atlantic Copper. Molybdenum concentrate and silver are also produced by certain of our North America copper mines.  
    
  Operating and Development Activities.   We have significant undeveloped reserves and resources in North America and a portfolio of long-term development projects. In the near term, we are deferring development of new projects as a result of current market conditions. Future investments will be undertaken based on the results of economic and technical feasibility studies, and market conditions.  
    
  During 2015, we revised plans for our North America copper mines to incorporate reductions in mining rates to reduce operating and capital costs. In addition, we curtailed operations at the Miami and Tyrone mines, and we are  operating our Sierrita mine at reduced rates. The revised plans at each of the operations incorporate the impacts of lower energy, acid and other consumables, reduced labor costs and a significant reduction in capital spending plans. These operating plans will continue to be reviewed and additional adjustments will be made as market conditions warrant.

Operating Data.   Following is a summary of consolidated operating data for the North America copper mines for the   third quarters     and first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  : 

a. 
    Refer to "Consolidated Results" for our consolidated molybdenum sales volumes, which includes sales of molybdenum produced at the North America copper mines. 
       
  Copper sales volumes from our North America copper mines of   458 million   pounds in   third-quarter     2016   were less than   third-quarter     2015   sales of   483 million   pounds, primarily attributable to the May 2016 sale of a portion of our interest in Morenci. Copper sales volumes from our North America mines of   1.43 billion   pounds   for the first nine months of     2016   were slightly lower than   1.44 billion   pounds   for the first nine months of     2015  . 
    
  Copper sales from North America are expected to approximate   1.8 billion   pounds for the year   2016  , compared with   2.0 billion   pounds in   2015  .  
    
  Unit Net Cash Costs.   Unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Gross Profit per Pound of Copper and Molybdenum 
  The following tables summarize unit net cash costs and gross profit per pound at our North America copper mines for the   third quarters     and first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  . Refer to  Product Revenues and Production Costs  for an explanation of the  by-product  and  co-product  methods and a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements. 

a. 
    Reflects sales of molybdenum produced by certain of the North America copper mines to our molybdenum sales company at market-based pricing. 
        
  Our North America copper mines have varying cost structures because of differences in ore grades and characteristics, processing costs, by-product credits and other factors. Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) of   $1.37   per pound of copper in   third-quarter     2016   and   $1.40   per pound   for the first nine months of     2016   were lower than unit net cash costs of   $1.68   per pound in   third-quarter     2015   and   $1.73   per pound   for the first nine months of     2015  , primarily reflecting cost reduction initiatives.

Because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, North America's average unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper production and sales. 
    
  Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for our North America copper mines are expected to approximate   $1.41   per pound of copper for the year   2016  , based on achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming an average molybdenum price of   $7   per pound for fourth-quarter   2016  . North America's average unit net cash costs would change by approximately   $0.005   per pound for each   $2   per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. 
    
  South America Mining 
  We operate two copper mines in South America   Cerro Verde in Peru (in which we own a 53.56 percent interest) and El Abra in Chile (in which we own a 51 percent interest), which are consolidated in our financial statements. 
    
  South America mining includes open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. Production from our South America mines is sold as copper concentrate or cathode under long-term contracts. Our South America mines also ship a portion of their copper concentrate inventories to Atlantic Copper. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. 
    
  Operating and Development Activities.   The Cerro Verde expansion project commenced operations in September 2015 and achieved capacity operating rates during first-quarter 2016. Cerro Verde's expanded operations benefit from its large-scale, long-lived reserves and cost efficiencies. The project expanded the concentrator facilities from 120,000 metric tons of ore per day to 360,000 metric tons of ore per day and is on track to provide incremental annual production of approximately 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum.  
    
  During 2015, we revised operating plans for our South America mines, principally to reflect adjustments to our mine plan at El Abra to reduce mining and stacking rates by approximately 50 percent to achieve lower operating and labor costs, defer capital expenditures and extend the life of the existing operations. 
    
  We continue to evaluate a potential large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. Exploration results in recent years at El Abra indicate a significant sulfide resource, which could potentially support a major mill project. Future investments will depend on technical studies, economic factors and global copper market conditions.

Gross Profit per Pound of Copper 
  The following tables summarize unit net cash costs and gross profit per pound of copper at the South America mining operations for the   third quarters     and first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  . Unit net cash costs per pound of copper are reflected under the by-product and co-product methods as the South America mining operations also had small amounts of molybdenum and silver sales. Refer to  Product Revenues and Production Costs  for an explanation of the  by-product  and  co-product  methods and a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements. 

Our South America mines have varying cost structures because of differences in ore grades and characteristics, processing costs, by-product credits and other factors. Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) of   $1.40   per pound of copper in   third-quarter     2016   and   $1.37   per pound   for the first nine months of     2016  , were lower than unit net cash costs of   $1.68   per pound in   third-quarter     2015   and   $1.80   per pound   for the first nine months of     2015  , primarily reflecting higher copper sales volumes and efficiencies associated with the Cerro Verde expansion and higher by-product credits. 
    
  Revenues from Cerro Verde's concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and refining charges. Accordingly, treatment charges will vary with Cerro Verde's sales volumes and the price of copper.

Because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, South America's unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper production and sales.  
    
  Revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior periods. Refer to  Consolidated Results - Revenues  for further discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced copper sales. 
    
  Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for our South America mining operations are expected to approximate   $1.42   per pound of copper for the year   2016  , based on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming average prices of   $7   per pound of molybdenum for fourth-quarter   2016  .  
    
  Indonesia Mining 
  Indonesia mining includes PT-FI s Grasberg minerals district, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits, in Papua, Indonesia. We own 90.64 percent of PT-FI, including 9.36 percent owned through our wholly owned subsidiary, PT Indocopper Investama.  
    
  PT-FI proportionately consolidates an unincorporated joint venture with Rio Tinto plc (Rio Tinto), under which Rio Tinto has a 40 percent interest in certain assets and a 40 percent interest through 2021 in production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver. Refer to Note 3 in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , for discussion of our joint venture with Rio Tinto.  
    
  PT-FI produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. Substantially all of PT-FI s copper concentrate is sold under long-term contracts, and during the first nine months of 2016, approximately half of PT-FI's concentrate production was sold to PT Smelting, its 25-percent-owned smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia.  
    
  Regulatory Matters.   PT-FI continues to engage with Indonesian government officials regarding its long-term operating rights under its Contract of Work (COW), and its rights to export concentrate without restriction. 
    
  In July 2014, PT-FI and the Indonesian government entered into a Memorandum of Understanding, in which subject to concluding an agreement to extend PT-FI's operations beyond 2021 on acceptable terms, PT-FI agreed to construct new smelter capacity in Indonesia and to divest an additional 20.64 percent interest in PT-FI at fair market value. PT-FI also agreed to pay higher royalties and to pay export duties until certain smelter development milestones were met. 
    
  In October 2015, the Indonesian government provided a letter of assurance to PT-FI indicating that it would revise regulations allowing it to approve the extension of operations beyond 2021, and provide the same rights and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under its current COW.  
    
  In August 2016, PT-FI's export permit was renewed through January 11, 2017. Current regulations published by the Indonesian government prohibit exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes after January 12, 2017. Indonesian government officials have indicated an intent to revise this regulation to protect employment and government revenues. The nature of any potential revisions of the regulation is currently uncertain. PT-FI is actively engaged with Indonesian government officials on this matter. Refer to "Risk Factors" contained in Part II, Item IA. for further discussion. 
    
  Operating and Development Activities.   PT-FI is currently mining the final phase of the Grasberg open pit, which contains high copper and gold ore grades. PT-FI expects to mine high-grade ore over the next several quarters prior to transitioning to the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine in the first half of 2018. 
    
  PT-FI has several projects in progress in the Grasberg minerals district related to the development of its large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies. In aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to produce large-scale quantities of copper and gold following the transition from the Grasberg open pit. From 2017 to 2020, estimated aggregate capital spending on these projects is currently expected to average $1.0 billion per year ($0.8 billion per year net to PT-FI). Considering the long-term nature and size of these projects, actual costs could vary from these estimates. In response to market conditions and Indonesian regulatory uncertainty, the timing of these expenditures continues to be reviewed.

The following provides additional information on the continued development of the Common Infrastructure project, the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine and the Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) ore body that lies below the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine. Our current plans and mineral reserves in Indonesia assume that PT-FI will be able to continue to export copper concentrate directly and through PT Smelting after January 12, 2017, and that PT-FI's COW will be extended beyond 2021. 
    
  Common Infrastructure and Grasberg Block Cave Mine.   In 2004, PT-FI commenced its Common Infrastructure project to provide access to its large undeveloped underground ore bodies located in the Grasberg minerals district through a tunnel system located approximately 400 meters deeper than its existing underground tunnel system. In addition to providing access to our underground ore bodies, the tunnel system will enable PT-FI to conduct future exploration in prospective areas associated with currently identified ore bodies. The tunnel system was completed to the Big Gossan terminal, and the Big Gossan mine was brought into production in 2010. Production from the Big Gossan mine, which is currently suspended, is expected to restart in the first half of 2017 and ramp up to 7,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2022. Development of the DMLZ and Grasberg Block Cave underground mines is advancing using the Common Infrastructure project tunnels as access. 
    
  The Grasberg Block Cave underground mine accounts for more than 45 percent of our recoverable proven and probable reserves in Indonesia. Production at the Grasberg Block Cave mine is expected to commence in 2018, following the end of mining of the Grasberg open pit. Targeted production rates once the Grasberg Block Cave mining operation reaches full capacity are expected to approximate 160,000 metric tons of ore per day. As a result of current market conditions, PT-FI is reviewing its operating plans to determine the optimum mine plan for the Grasberg Block Cave.  
    
  Aggregate mine development capital for the Grasberg Block Cave mine and associated Common Infrastructure is expected to approximate   $6.0 billion   (incurred between 2008 and 2022), with PT-FI s share totaling approximately   $5.5 billion  . Aggregate project costs totaling   $2.6 billion   have been incurred through   September 30, 2016   (  $416 million   during   the first nine months   of   2016  ).  
    
  DMLZ.   The DMLZ ore body lies below the DOZ mine at the 2,590-meter elevation and represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the Ertsberg East Skarn system and neighboring Ertsberg porphyry. In September 2015, PT-FI initiated pre-commercial production that represents ore extracted during the development phase for the purpose of obtaining access to the ore body. Targeted production rates once the DMLZ underground mine reaches full capacity are expected to approximate 80,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021. 
    
  Drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of the ore body. Aggregate mine development capital costs for the DMLZ underground mine are expected to approximate   $2.6 billion   (incurred between 2009 and 2020), with PT-FI s share totaling approximately   $1.6 billion  . Aggregate project costs totaling   $1.8 billion   have been incurred through   September 30, 2016   (  $243 million   during   the first nine months   of   2016  ).

a. 
    Amounts represent the approximate average daily throughput processed at PT-FI s mill facilities from each producing mine and from development activities that result in metal production. 
        
  Indonesia's consolidated copper sales of   332 million   pounds in   third-quarter     2016   and   702 million   pounds   for the first nine months of     2016  , were higher than sales of   198 million   pounds in   third-quarter     2015   and   549 million   pounds   for the first nine months of     2015  , primarily reflecting higher copper ore grades. 
    
  Indonesia's gold sales totaled   307 thousand   ounces in   third-quarter     2016   and   653 thousand   ounces   for the first nine months of     2016  , compared with   285 thousand   ounces in   third-quarter     2015   and   891 thousand   ounces   for the first nine months of     2015  . Lower gold volumes in the first nine months of 2016, compared with the first nine months of 2015, primarily reflect lower ore grades. During third-quarter 2016, PT-FI experienced labor productivity issues and a 10-day work stoppage beginning in late September, which affected the timing of access to higher grade ore and resulted in a deferral of production into future periods.  
    
  At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing of mining areas with varying ore grades causes fluctuations in quarterly and annual production of copper and gold. Consolidated sales volumes from our Indonesia mining operations are expected to approximate   1.2 billion   pounds of copper and   1.24 million   ounces of gold for the year   2016  , compared with   744 million   pounds of copper and   1.2 million   ounces of gold for the year   2015  . Ore grades are expected to further improve in 2017 because of increased access to higher grade sections of the Grasberg open pit. Indonesia mining's projected sales volumes are dependent on a number of factors, including operational performance, the timing of shipments and approval by the Indonesian government to continue the export of copper concentrate and anode slimes.

A significant portion of PT-FI's costs are fixed and unit costs vary depending on volumes and other factors. Indonesia's unit net cash costs (including gold and silver credits) of   $0.57   per pound of copper in   third-quarter     2016   and   $0.92   per pound of copper   for the first nine months of     2016  , were lower than   $1.18   per pound of copper in   third-quarter     2015   and   $1.09   per pound of copper   for the first nine months of     2015  , primarily reflecting higher copper sales volumes, partly offset by lower gold and silver credits.  
    
  Treatment charges vary with the volume of metals sold and the price of copper, and royalties vary with the volume of metals sold and the prices of copper and gold. 
    
  Export duties were initially set at 7.5 percent in July 2014 and were reduced to 5.0 percent in July 2015 as a result of smelter development progress. Export duties totaled   $34 million   in   third-quarter   2016,   $35 million   in   third-quarter   2015,   $63 million     for the first nine months of   2016 and   $92 million     for the first nine months of   2015. 
    
  Because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, PT-FI s unit depreciation rate varies with the level of copper production and sales. 
    
  Revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior periods. Refer to  Consolidated Results - Revenues  for further discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced copper sales. 
    
  PT Smelting intercompany (loss) profit represents the change in the deferral of 25 percent of PT-FI's profit on sales to PT Smelting. Refer to "Operations - Smelting   Refining" for further discussion. 
    
  Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming an average gold price of   $1,250   per ounce for fourth-quarter   2016  , unit net cash costs (net of gold and silver credits) for Indonesia mining are expected to approximate   $0.62   per pound of copper for the year 2016. Indonesia mining's unit net cash costs for the year   2016   would change by approximately   $0.03   per pound for each   $50   per ounce change in the average price of gold for fourth-quarter 2016. Because of the fixed nature of a large portion of Indonesia's costs, unit costs vary from quarter to quarter depending on copper and gold volumes. Anticipated higher ore grades from Grasberg are expected to result in lower unit net cash costs in fourth-quarter 2016 and for the year 2017.

Molybdenum Mines 
  We have two wholly owned molybdenum mines in North America   the Henderson underground mine and the Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. The majority of the molybdenum concentrate produced at the Henderson and Climax mines, as well as from our North and South America copper mines, is processed at our own conversion facilities.  
    
  Operating and Development Activities.   In response to market conditions, the revised plans for our Henderson molybdenum mine incorporate lower operating rates, resulting in an approximate 65 percent reduction in Henderson's annual production volumes. We have also adjusted production plans at our by-product mines, including reduced production at the Sierrita mine. Additionally, we have incorporated changes in the commercial pricing structure for our chemical products to promote continuation of chemical-grade production. 
    
  Production from the Molybdenum mines totaled   5 million   pounds of molybdenum in   third-quarter     2016   and   19 million   pounds of molybdenum   for the first nine months of     2016  , compared with   13 million   pounds of molybdenum in   third-quarter     2015   and   39 million   pounds of molybdenum   for the first nine months of     2015  . Refer to "Consolidated Results" for our consolidated molybdenum operating data, which includes sales of molybdenum produced at our Molybdenum mines, and from our North and South America copper mines, and refer to "Outlook" for projected consolidated molybdenum sales volumes. 
    
  Unit Net Cash Costs Per Pound of Molybdenum.   Unit net cash costs per pound of molybdenum is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
    
  Average unit net cash costs for our Molybdenum mines of   $10.28   per pound of molybdenum in   third-quarter     2016   and   $8.39   per pound of molybdenum   for the first nine months of     2016  , were higher than average unit net cash costs of   $6.93   per pound in   third-quarter     2015   and   $7.10     for the first nine months of     2015  , primarily reflecting lower volumes. Assuming achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, we estimate unit net cash costs for the Molybdenum mines to average   $8.50   per pound of molybdenum for the year   2016  . Refer to  Product Revenues and Production Costs  for a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Smelting and Refining 
  We wholly own and operate a smelter in Arizona (Miami smelter) and a smelter and refinery in Spain (Atlantic Copper). Additionally, PT-FI owns 25 percent of a smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia (PT Smelting). Treatment charges for smelting and refining copper concentrate consist of a base rate per pound of copper and per ounce of gold and are generally fixed. Treatment charges represent a cost to our mining operations and income to Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting. Thus, higher treatment charges benefit our smelter operations and adversely affect our mining operations. Our North America copper mines are less significantly affected by changes in treatment charges because these operations are largely integrated with our Miami smelter. Through this form of downstream integration, we are assured placement of a significant portion of our concentrate production. 
    
  Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. During   the first nine months   of   2016  , Atlantic Copper's concentrate purchases from our copper mining operations included 11 percent from our North America copper mines, 9 percent from South America mining and 5 percent from Indonesia mining, with the remainder purchased from third parties.  
    
  PT-FI's contract with PT Smelting provides for PT-FI to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements (subject to a minimum or maximum rate) necessary for PT Smelting to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis. PT-FI may also sell copper concentrate to PT Smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205,000 metric tons of copper annually. During   the first nine months   of   2016  , PT-FI supplied approximately 90 percent of PT Smelting's concentrate requirements, and PT Smelting processed approximately half of PT-FI's concentrate production.

Refer to "Risk Factors" contained in Part II, Item IA. for information regarding current Indonesian regulations that prohibit the export of anode slimes by PT Smelting after January 12, 2017. 
    
  We defer recognizing profits on sales from our mining operations to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FI's sales to PT Smelting until final sales to third parties occur. Changes in these deferrals attributable to variability in intercompany volumes resulted in net additions to net income attributable to common stock of   $17 million   in   third-quarter     2016  , less than $1 million in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $6 million   for   the first nine months   of 2016 and   $37 million   for   the first nine months   of   2015  . Our net deferred profits on our inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods  net income attributable to common stock from continuing operations totaled   $19 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices will result in variability in our net deferred profits and quarterly earnings.  
    
  Oil and Gas  
  Through our wholly owned oil and gas subsidiary, FM O G, our principal oil and gas assets include oil production facilities in the Deepwater GOM and in California.  
    
  In July 2016, FM O G completed the sale of its Haynesville shale assets for $87 million (before closing adjustments) and in second-quarter 2016, completed the sale of certain oil and gas royalty interests for $102 million (before closing adjustments). Under full cost accounting rules, the proceeds from these transactions were recorded as a reduction of capitalized oil and gas properties, with no gain or loss recognition.  
    
  In September 2016, FM O G entered into an agreement to sell its Deepwater GOM properties for cash consideration of $2.0 billion (before closing adjustments) and up to $150 million in contingent payments, which would be received over time as the purchaser realizes future cash flows in connection with our third-party production handling agreement for the Marlin platform. The transaction has an effective date of August 1, 2016, and is expected to close in fourth-quarter 2016, subject to customary closing conditions. In connection with the transaction, FM O G entered into an agreement to amend the terms of the Plains Offshore preferred stock to provide FM O G the option to call these securities for   $582 million  , which FM O G expects to exercise at the time the Deepwater GOM sale closes. 
    
  In October 2016, FM O G entered into an agreement to sell its onshore California oil and gas properties for cash consideration of $592 million (before closing adjustments) and contingent consideration of up to $150 million, consisting of $50 million per year for each of 2018, 2019 and 2020 if the price of Brent crude oil averages $70 per barrel or higher in each of those calendar years. The transaction has an effective date of July 1, 2016, and is expected to close in fourth-quarter 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.  
    
  Under full cost accounting rules, the Deepwater GOM and onshore California transactions will require gain or loss recognition because of their significance to the full cost pool, but the amounts are not expected to be material. Refer to Note   2   for further discussion of these oil and gas transactions, including the derivative contracts entered into during October 2016 as part of the sales agreement for the onshore California oil and gas properties. 
    
  Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties.    As discussed in Note 1, under full cost accounting rules, a "ceiling test" is conducted each quarter to review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties for impairment. The SEC requires the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference oil price be used in determining the ceiling test limitation. The reference pricing in ceiling test impairment calculations may cause results that do not reflect current market conditions that exist at the end of an accounting period. For example, in periods of increasing oil and gas prices, the use of a twelve-month historical average price in the ceiling test calculation may result in an impairment. Conversely, in times of declining prices, ceiling test calculations may not result in an impairment.  
    
  Using West Texas Intermediate (WTI) as the reference oil price, the average price was   $41.68   per barrel at   September 30, 2016  , compared with $43.12 per barrel at June 30, 2016. Combined with the impact of the reduction in twelve-month historical prices and reserve revisions, net capitalized costs exceeded the related ceiling test limitation under full cost accounting rules, which resulted in the recognition of impairment charges totaling   $239 million   in   third-quarter     2016   and   $4.3 billion   for the first nine months of   2016  .

U.S. Oil   Gas Operating Data.   Following is summary operating results for the U.S. oil and gas operations for the   third quarters     and first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  :  

a. 
    Cash operating margin for oil and gas operations reflects realized revenues less cash production costs. Cash production costs exclude accretion and other costs. For reconciliations of realized revenues (including average realized prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs) and cash production costs to revenues and production and delivery costs reported in our consolidated financial statements, refer to "Product Revenues and Production Costs." 
               c. 
    Includes charges of   $2.81   per BOE in   third-quarter     2016   and   $25.32   per BOE for   the first nine months   of   2016  , primarily for idle rig/drillship settlements, inventory adjustments and asset impairments and charges of   $1.54   per BOE in   third-quarter     2015   and   $1.48   per BOE for   the first nine months   of   2015  , primarily for idle rig costs, inventory adjustments and prior period  property tax assessments related to the California properties. 
       
  FM O G's average realized price for crude oil was   $40.63   per barrel (  86 percent   of the average Brent crude oil price of   $46.99   per barrel) in   third-quarter     2016   and   $37.11   per barrel (  86 percent   of the average Brent crude oil price of   $43.17   per barrel)   for the first nine months of     2016  .  
    
  FM O G's average realized price for natural gas was   $2.84   per MMBtu in   third-quarter     2016  , compared to the NYMEX natural gas price average of   $2.81   per MMBtu for the July through   September 2016   contracts; and   $2.24   per MMBtu   for the first nine months of     2016  , compared to the NYMEX natural gas price average of   $2.28   per MMBtu for the January through   September 2016   contracts. 
    
  Realized revenues for oil and gas operations of   $34.99   per BOE in   third-quarter     2016   and   $30.50   per BOE   for the first nine months of     2016   were lower than realized revenues of   $43.00   per BOE in   third-quarter   2015 and   $45.57   per BOE   for the first nine months of   2015, primarily reflecting lower oil prices and the impact of realized cash gains on derivative contracts of   $7.44   per BOE in third-quarter 2015 and   $7.72   per BOE for the first nine months of 2015.  
    
  Cash production costs for oil and gas operations of   $15.00   per BOE in   third-quarter     2016   and   $15.28   per BOE   for the first nine months of     2016   were lower than cash production costs of   $18.85   per BOE in   third-quarter   2015 and   $19.42   per BOE   for the first nine months of   2015, primarily reflecting ongoing cost reduction efforts. The first nine months of 2016, compared with the 2015 period, also reflects the impact of higher production from the GOM. Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, cash production costs are expected to approximate   $16.00   per BOE for the year   2016  .

Following is a summary of average sales volumes per day by region for oil and gas operations for the   third quarters     and first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  :  

a. 
    In September 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the Deepwater GOM properties. This transaction is expected to close in fourth-quarter 2016. 
              b. 
    In October 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the onshore California properties. This transaction is expected to close in fourth-quarter 2016. 
              c. 
    In July 2016, we completed the sale of the Haynesville shale assets. 
       
  Daily sales volumes averaged   131   MBOE in   third-quarter     2016  , including   99   thousand barrels (MBbls) of crude oil,   150   million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and   7   MBbls of NGLs, and   133   MBOE   for the first nine months of     2016  , including   95   MBbls of crude oil,   191   MMcf of natural gas and   6   MBbls of NGLs.  
    
  Following completion of the Deepwater GOM and onshore California transactions, our portfolio of oil and gas assets would include oil and natural gas production onshore in South Louisiana and on the GOM Shelf, oil production offshore California and natural gas production from the Madden area in Central Wyoming. In third-quarter 2016, these properties produced an average of 7 MBbls of oil and NGLs per day and 74 MMcf of natural gas per day. 
    
  Oil and Gas Capital Expenditures  . Capital expenditures for our oil and gas operations in   third-quarter     2016   totaled   $160 million   (including   $75 million   incurred for GOM). Capital expenditures for our oil and gas operations   for the first nine months of     2016   totaled   $1.0 billion   in the U.S. (including   $0.6 billion   incurred for GOM) and   $47 million   for international oil and gas properties, primarily associated with Morocco. Capital expenditures for oil and gas operations are estimated to total   $1.2 billion   for the year   2016  .  
    
  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
    
  Africa Mining 
  As further discussed in Note   2  , in May 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in TFHL, through which we hold an effective 56 percent interest in the Tenke copper and cobalt mining concessions in the Southeast region of the DRC. In accordance with accounting guidelines, the operating results of Africa mining have been separately reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. The closing of the transaction is currently subject to customary closing conditions, including the resolution of the right of first offer (which expires on November 15, 2016) of Lundin Mining Corporation (which holds a 30 percent interest in TFHL), and the parties are working towards a satisfactory resolution in order to complete the transaction in fourth-quarter 2016. In addition, La G n rale des Carri res et des Mines (G camines), which is wholly owned by the DRC government and holds a 20 percent non-dilutable interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining S.A.) recently filed an arbitration proceeding with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) International Court of Arbitration challenging the transaction; however, we believe that G camines  claims have no legal basis. 
    
  The Tenke operation includes open-pit mining, leaching and SX/EW operations. Copper production from the Tenke minerals district is sold as copper cathode. In addition to copper, the Tenke minerals district produces cobalt hydroxide.

Operating Data.   Following is a summary of consolidated operating data for our Africa mining operations for the   third quarters     and first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  : 

a. 
    Includes point-of-sale transportation costs as negotiated in customer contracts. 
       
  Africa mining's copper sales of   118 million   pounds in   third-quarter     2016   and   365 million   pounds   for the first nine months of     2016  , were higher than sales of   113 million   pounds in   third-quarter     2015   and   350 million   pounds   for the first nine months of     2015  , primarily reflecting higher mining and milling rates. The third-quarter 2016 also reflects higher copper ore grades. 
    
  Africa mining's sales for   2016   are expected to approximate   485 million   pounds of copper and   38 million   pounds of cobalt, compared with   467 million   pounds of copper and   35 million   pounds of cobalt for the year   2015  . Africa mining's projected sales for the year 2016 would be impacted by the timing of the completion of the sale of our interest in TFHL. 
    
  Unit Net Cash Costs.   Unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Gross Profit per Pound of Copper and Cobalt.   The following tables summarize the unit net cash costs and gross profit per pound of copper and cobalt at our Africa mining operations for the   third quarters     and first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  . Refer to  Product Revenues and Production Costs  for an explanation of  by-product  and  co-product  methods and a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to net (loss) income from discontinued operations reported in our consolidated financial statements. 

a. 
    Includes point-of-sale transportation costs as negotiated in customer contracts.  
              b. 
    Net of cobalt downstream processing and freight costs. 
       
  Unit net cash costs (net of cobalt credits) for Africa mining were   $1.16   per pound of copper in   third-quarter     2016  ,   $1.15   per pound of copper in   third-quarter     2015  ,   $1.27   per pound of copper   for the first nine months of     2016   and  $1.17   per pound of copper   for the first nine months of     2015  . The third quarter and first nine-months of 2016, compared with the 2015 periods, reflect lower cobalt credits.  
    
  Because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, Africa mining's unit depreciation rate may vary with the level of copper production and sales.

     Table of Contents                  

Based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average cobalt price of   $11   per pound for fourth-quarter   2016  , unit net cash costs (net of cobalt credits) for Africa mining are expected to approximate   $1.26   per pound of copper for   2016  .  

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
    
  Our operating cash flows vary with prices realized from copper, gold, molybdenum and oil sales, our sales volumes, production costs, income taxes, other working capital changes and other factors. In response to weak market conditions, we have taken actions to enhance our financial position, including significant reductions in capital spending, production curtailments at certain North and South America mines and actions to reduce operating, exploration and administrative costs. 
    
  In addition to reducing costs and capital expenditures to maximize cash flows from our global business, we have announced $6.6 billion in asset sale transactions from which we have received aggregate cash consideration of $1.4 billion. The remaining $5.2 billion in gross proceeds associated with the pending sale of our interest in TFHL and the sales of our Deepwater GOM and onshore California oil and gas properties is expected to be received in fourth-quarter 2016. Refer to Note   2   for further discussion of these disposal transactions.  
    
  In July 2016, we commenced a new registered at-the-market equity offering of up to $1.5 billion in common stock. Through   November 8, 2016  ,   we have sold 59.8 million shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $719 million ($12.02 per share average price)  . 
    
  We remain focused on our high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to generate value as market conditions improve. In addition to debt reduction plans, we are pursuing opportunities to create additional value through mine designs that would increase copper reserves, reduce costs and provide opportunities to enhance net present values, and we continue to advance studies for future development of our copper resources, the timing of which will be dependent on market conditions.  
    
  Cash 
  Following is a summary of the U.S. and international components of consolidated cash and cash equivalents available to the parent company (excluding cash and cash equivalents in assets held for sale of   $68 million   at September 30, 2016, and $29 million at December 31, 2015), net of noncontrolling interests' share, taxes and other costs (in millions): 

Cash held at our international operations is generally used to support our foreign operations' capital expenditures, operating expenses, working capital and other tax payments, or other cash needs. Management believes that 
  sufficient liquidity is available in the U.S. from cash balances and availability from our revolving credit facility and uncommitted lines of credit. We have not elected to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, and we have recorded deferred tax liabilities for foreign earnings that are available to be repatriated to the U.S. From time to time, our foreign subsidiaries distribute earnings to the U.S. through dividends that are subject to applicable withholding taxes and noncontrolling interests' share.

Debt 
  Following is a summary of our total debt and the related weighted-average interest rates (in billions, except percentages):  

a.  In accordance with the mandatory prepayment provision of the amended Term Loan, 50 percent of the proceeds associated with our pending asset sale transactions must be applied toward repaying the Term Loan. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had no borrowings,   $43 million   in letters of credit issued and availability of   $3.5 billion   under the FCX revolving credit facility. 
    
  Through August 4, 2016, we exchanged $369 million in senior notes (including $101 million during third-quarter 2016) maturing in 2022, 2023, 2034 and 2043 for   28 million   shares of our common stock in a series of privately negotiated transactions. 
    
  Refer to Note   6   for further discussion of debt.  
    
  Operating Activities 
  We generated consolidated operating cash flows of   $2.6 billion   (including   $463 million   in working capital sources and changes in other tax payments) for the first nine months of 2016 and   $2.6 billion   (including   $342 million   for working capital sources and changes in other tax payments) for the first nine months of 2015. Lower copper price realizations for the first nine months of 2016 were offset by an increase in working capital sources mostly resulting from lower tax payments from our international mining operations. Additionally, the first nine months of 2015 included tax payments of approximately $0.3 billion associated with our November 2014 sale of Candelaria. 
    
  Based on current operating plans, subject to future commodity prices for copper, gold and molybdenum and subject to a favorable resolution of Indonesian regulatory matters, we expect estimated consolidated operating cash flows for the year 2017, plus available cash and availability under our credit facility and uncommitted lines of credit, to be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, noncontrolling interest distributions and other cash requirements for the year. Refer to  Outlook  for further discussion of projected operating cash flows for the year   2016  . 
    
  Investing Activities 
  Capital Expenditures.   Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled   $2.3 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , consisting of   $1.2 billion   for mining operations (including   $0.9 billion   for major projects) and   $1.1 billion   for oil and gas operations. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled   $5.06 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , consisting of   $2.5 billion   for mining operations (including $1.8 billion for major projects) and $2.5 billion for oil and gas operations. Lower capital expenditures for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with the first   nine   months of   2015  , primarily reflect a decrease in major mining projects associated with the completion of the Cerro Verde expansion and a decrease in oil and gas activities in Deepwater GOM. Refer to  Outlook  for further discussion of projected capital expenditures for the year 2016. 
    
  Dispositions.   Net proceeds from asset sales totaled $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2016 primarily associated with the   $1.0 billion   sale of an additional   13 percent   undivided interest in Morenci, the sale of an interest in the Timok exploration project in Serbia and from oil and gas asset sales, including the Haynesville shale assets and certain oil and gas royalty interests. Refer to Note   2   for further discussion of these transactions.

Net repayments of debt for the first nine months of 2016 primarily reflect   $0.6 billion   of payments on the Term Loan, $0.2 billion of payments on the Cerro Verde credit facility and $0.2 billion of payments on lines of credit. Refer to Note   6   for further discussion of debt. 
    
  Net proceeds from debt for the first nine months of 2015 primarily included net borrowings of $1.1 billion under Cerro Verde's senior unsecured credit facility primarily to fund its expansion project, $0.5 billion under our revolving credit facility and $0.2 billion under our unsecured lines of credit. 
    
  Equity Transactions.   Net proceeds from the sale of common stock for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 reflect sales of our common stock under registered at-the-market equity programs (refer to Note 6).   
    
  In January 2016, we sold   4 million   shares of our common stock (with a value of   $32 million  ) under our 2015 at-the-market equity programs. In July 2016, we commenced a new registered at-the-market equity offering of up to   $1.5 billion   of common stock, and through September 30, 2016, we sold   33.5 million   shares of our common stock, for gross proceeds of   $415 million   (  $12.39   per share average price). From October 1, 2016, through   November 8, 2016  , we sold   26.3 million   shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of   $304 million   (  $11.54   per share average price). 
    
  During third-quarter 2015, we sold   97.5 million   shares of common stock under our 2015 at-the-market equity programs, which generated gross proceeds of   $1.0 billion  .  
    
  Dividends.   The Board reduced our annual common stock dividend from $1.25 per share to $0.20 per share in March 2015, and subsequently suspended the annual common stock dividend in December 2015. Common stock dividends of   $5 million   for the first nine months of 2016 relate to accumulated dividends paid for vested stock-based compensation, and common stock dividends of   $547 million   for the first nine months of   2015   include $115 million for special dividends paid in accordance with the settlement terms of the shareholder derivative litigation. The declaration of dividends is at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Additionally, in connection with the February 2016 amendment to the revolving credit facility and Term Loan, we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock on or prior to March 31, 2017. 
    
  Cash dividends and other distributions paid to noncontrolling interests totaled   $87 million   for the first   nine   months of 2016 and   $89 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . These payments will vary based on the cash requirements of the related consolidated subsidiaries. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
    
  As further discussed in Note   9  , during second-quarter 2016, we terminated FM O G's three drilling rig contracts for cash and common stock representing a value of $755 million (excluding contingent consideration) and settled aggregate commitments totaling $1.1 billion. Additionally, as further discussed in Note   6  , during the first nine months of 2016, we have reduced our December 31, 2015, debt balance by $1.45 billion. There have been no other material changes in our contractual obligations since   December 31, 2015  . Refer to Part II, Items 7. and 7A. in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , for further information regarding our contractual obligations. 

CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Environmental and Asset Retirement Obligations 
  Our current and historical operating activities are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We perform a comprehensive annual review of our environmental and asset retirement obligations and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. There have been no material changes to our environmental and asset retirement obligations since December 31, 2015. Updated cost assumptions, including increases and decreases to cost estimates, changes in the anticipated scope and timing of remediation activities, and settlement of environmental matters may result in additional revisions to certain of our environmental obligations. Refer to Note 12 in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , for further information regarding our environmental and asset retirement obligations.

Litigation and Other Contingencies 
  Other than as discussed in Note   9  , there have been no material changes to our contingencies associated with legal proceedings and other matters since   December 31, 2015  . Refer to Note 12 and "Legal Proceedings" contained in Part I, Item 3. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , for further information regarding legal proceedings and other matters. 

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
    
  Refer to Note   12   for discussion of recently issued accounting standards and their impact on our future financial statements and disclosures.  

PRODUCT REVENUES AND PRODUCTION COSTS 
    
  Mining Product Revenues and Unit Net Cash Cost 
  Unit net cash costs per pound of copper and molybdenum are measures intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for the respective operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
    
  We present gross profit per pound of copper in the following tables using both a  by-product  method and a  co-product  method. We use the by-product method in our presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (i) the majority of our revenues are copper revenues, (ii) we mine ore, which contains copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals, (iii) it is not possible to specifically assign all of our costs to revenues from the copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals we produce, (iv) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (v) it is the method used by our management and our Board to monitor operations. In the co-product method presentations below, shared costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent our metals sales volumes and realized prices change. 
    
  We show revenue adjustments for prior period open sales as a separate line item. Because these adjustments do not result from current period sales, we have reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and other costs consist of items such as stock-based compensation costs, start-up costs, inventory adjustments, long-lived asset retirements/impairments, restructuring and/or unusual charges. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs. As discussed above, gold, molybdenum and other metal revenues at copper mines are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. The following schedules for our mining operations are presentations under both the by-product and co-product methods together with reconciliations to amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  U.S. Oil and Gas Product Revenues and Cash Production Costs per Unit 
  Realized revenues and cash production costs per unit are measures intended to provide investors with information about the cash operating margin of our oil and gas operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our oil and gas operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
    
  Accretion charges for asset retirement obligations and other costs, such as drillship settlements/idle rig costs, inventory write downs and/or unusual charges, are removed from production and delivery costs in the calculation of cash production costs per BOE. Additionally, in the 2015 periods, we had crude oil derivative contracts. We show revenue adjustments from these derivative contracts as separate line items. Because these adjustments did not result from oil and gas sales, gains and losses have been reflected separately from revenues on current period sales. The following schedules include calculations of oil and gas product revenues and cash production costs together with a reconciliation to amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT  
    
  Our discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements in which we discuss factors we believe may affect our future performance. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates; production and sales volumes; unit net cash costs; cash production costs per BOE; operating cash flows; capital expenditures; debt reduction initiatives, including our ability to complete pending asset sales and the anticipated timing thereof, and to sell additional assets; exploration efforts and results; development and production activities and costs; liquidity; tax rates; the impact of copper, gold, molybdenum, cobalt, crude oil and natural gas price changes; the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings; reserve estimates; future dividend payments, and share purchases and sales. The words  anticipates,   may,   can,   plans,   believes,   estimates,   expects,   projects,   targets,   intends,   likely,   will,   should,   to be,   potential,  and any similar expressions are intended to identify those assertions as forward-looking statements. Under our term loan and revolving credit facility, as amended, we are not permitted to pay dividends on common stock on or prior to March 31, 2017. The declaration of dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors (Board), subject to restrictions under our credit agreements, and will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.  
    
  We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include supply of and demand for, and prices of, copper, gold, molybdenum, cobalt, crude oil and natural gas, mine sequencing, production rates, drilling results, potential effects of cost and capital expenditure reductions and production curtailments on financial results and cash flow, the outcome of our debt reduction initiatives, our ability to secure regulatory approvals, satisfy closing conditions and consummate pending asset sales, potential additional oil and gas property impairment charges, potential inventory adjustments, potential impairment of long-lived mining assets, the outcome of ongoing discussions with the Indonesian government regarding PT Freeport Indonesia's (PT-FI) Contract of Work (COW), the potential effects of violence in Indonesia generally and in the province of Papua, the resolution of administrative disputes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, industry risks, regulatory changes, political risks, labor relations, weather- and climate-related risks, environmental risks, litigation results and other factors described in more detail in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC and Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this report. With respect to our operations in Indonesia, such factors include whether PT-FI will be able to continue to export its copper concentrate, or whether PT Smelting (PT-FI's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit) will be able to export its anode slimes after the January 12, 2017, effective date of regulations prohibiting exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes, including whether and when those regulations may be revised and whether any such revisions would impose conditions or costs on PT-FI not contained in its COW. The inability of PT-FI and PT Smelting to export copper concentrate and anode slimes, respectively, for any extended period of time would lead to the suspension of all of our production in Indonesia.  
    
  Investors are cautioned that many of the assumptions upon which our forward-looking statements are based are likely to change after the forward-looking statements are made, including for example commodity prices, which we cannot control, and production volumes and costs, some aspects of which we may not be able to control. Further, we may make changes to our business plans that could affect our results. We caution investors that we do not intend to update forward-looking statements more frequently than quarterly notwithstanding any changes in our assumptions, changes in business plans, actual experience or other changes, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures.    
       
           (a) 
    Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.   Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, with the participation of management, have evaluated the effectiveness of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on their evaluation, they have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
       
           (b) 
    Changes in internal control over financial reporting.    There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings by government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. 
    
  Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any proceeding reported in Note 9 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016  , and in Part I, Item 3.  Legal Proceedings  and Note 12 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition; although individual outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period.  

Item 1A.    Risk Factors. 
    
  The risk factor    Because our Grasberg mining operations in Indonesia is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in Indonesia   , which was included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, is amended to add the following:  
    
  PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. Substantially all of PT-FI s copper concentrate is sold under long-term contracts, and during the first nine months of 2016, approximately half of PT-FI s concentrate production was sold to PT Smelting (PT-FI's 25-percent owned smelter and refinery), which is the only copper smelter in Indonesia. 
    
  In August 2016, PT-FI s export permit was renewed through January 11, 2017. Current regulations published by the Indonesian government prohibit exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes (a by-product of the copper refining process containing metals including gold, produced by PT Smelting) after January 12, 2017. The Indonesian government has indicated it intends to revise these regulations in order to protect employment and government revenues, but we cannot predict whether and when those regulations may be revised or whether any such revisions would impose conditions or costs on PT-FI not contained in its Contract of Work (COW), such as additional royalty payments or export duties, increased smelter development commitments, increased depository

requirements, or conversion of contracts of work to less favorable licenses under the 2009 mining law framework. PT-FI is actively engaged with Indonesian government officials to resolve this matter.  
    
  We also cannot predict whether PT-FI will be able to continue to export its copper concentrate, or whether PT Smelting will be able to export its anode slimes, after January 12, 2017. The inability of PT-FI and PT Smelting to export copper concentrate and anode slimes, respectively, for any extended period of time, would lead to the suspension of all of our production in Indonesia, which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, liquidity and profitability, and could result in asset impairments, inventory write downs, difficulty in meeting covenants under our credit facilities, and a significant reduction in our reported mineral reserves.   
    
  The initial term of PT-FI s COW expires in 2021, but the COW explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesian government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. PT-FI has been engaged in discussions with officials of the Indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its COW, including extending its term. We cannot predict whether PT-FI will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of its long-term mining rights. If PT-FI is unable to reach agreement with the Indonesian government on its long-term rights, we may be required to reduce or defer investments in underground development projects, which would have a material adverse effect on our future production, cash flow, liquidity and profitability, and could result in asset impairments, inventory write downs, difficulty in meeting covenants under our credit facilities, and a significant reduction in our reported mineral reserves. 
    
  In the event PT-FI is unable to reach a satisfactory resolution of these matters, PT-FI would intend to pursue any and all claims against the Indonesian government for breach of contract through international arbitration. 
    
  On October 14, 2016, a new Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources was appointed, the fourth person to hold the office since July 2016. We cannot predict what impact the transition will have on any amendments to existing regulations, or the progress or outcome of PT-FI s COW negotiations. 
    
  The risk factor    Mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations, and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations. We also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our oil and gas properties, and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those operations. Changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us   , which was included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, is amended to add the following: 
    
  With respect to our mining operations, our financial assurance obligations are based principally on state laws that may vary by jurisdiction, depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality. Although Section 108(b) of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to identify classes of facilities that must establish evidence of financial responsibility, currently there are no financial assurance requirements for active mining operations under CERCLA. In August 2014, several environmental organizations initiated litigation against the EPA to require it to set a schedule for adopting financial assurance regulations under CERCLA governing the hard rock mining industry. The EPA and the environmental organizations reached a joint agreement and submitted it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for approval. Notwithstanding industry objections, the court approved the agreement on January 29, 2016, thereby requiring the EPA to propose financial assurance regulations for the hard rock mining industry by December 1, 2016, and to provide notice of its final action by December 1, 2017. The EPA recently filed a status update with the court confirming that it intended to proceed with promulgation of the proposed rules by December 1, 2016. Based on limited information contained in recent conceptual presentations made by the EPA, the proposed rules, if promulgated as apparently envisioned by the EPA, would result in onerous financial responsibility obligations for our U.S. hard rock mining operations. For instance, the form, cost and availability of financial mechanisms necessary to meet such obligations is uncertain (if they could be met at all). In addition, complying with these obligations could be very costly, harm the international competitiveness of our U.S. hard rock mining operations and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operations and profitability. 
    
  Except as described above, there have been no material changes to our risk factors during the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . For additional information on risk factors, refer to Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
       
  (a) We entered into privately negotiated share exchange agreements to exchange certain of our outstanding senior notes for shares of our common stock, plus cash representing accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 8 million shares of common stock and approximately $2 million in cash representing accrued and unpaid interest, in exchange for an aggregate of $101 million in senior notes, consisting of: (i) $23 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.550% Senior Notes due 2022; (ii) $25 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.875% Senior Notes due 2023; and (iii) $53 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.450% Senior Notes due 2043. 
    
  The issuance of shares of common stock in the exchange transactions was made in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof, as the exchanges were made with existing security holders exclusively in a series of privately negotiated transactions where no commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting the exchanges. 
    
           (c) 
    The following table sets forth information with respect to shares of our common stock purchased by us during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

a. 
    On July 21, 2008, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our open-market share purchase program for up to 30 million shares. There have been no purchases under this program since 2008. This program does not have an expiration date. 

Item 4. 
    Mine Safety Disclosures. 
       
  The safety and health of all employees is our highest priority. Management believes that safety and health considerations are integral to, and compatible with, all other functions in the organization and that proper safety and health management will enhance production and reduce costs. Our approach towards the safety and health of our workforce is to continuously improve performance through implementing robust management systems and providing adequate training, safety incentive and occupational health programs. The information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95.1 to this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

  Section 1.3        Effective Time; Proration of Costs and Revenues  . 
  (a)        Possession of the Assets shall be transferred from Seller to Purchaser at the Closing, but certain financial benefits and burdens in respect of the Assets shall be transferred effective as of the Effective Time, as described below. 
  (b)        Purchaser shall be entitled to all production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Assets on and after the Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets on and after the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Operating Expenses incurred on and after the Effective Time.

     11 

the platform located on the Lands or, if there are no such storage facilities, when they pass through the lease automated custody transfer (LACT) meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they are transported from the Lands, and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be  from or attributable to  the Assets when they pass through the delivery point sales meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they are transported from the Lands.

Seller shall provide to Purchaser, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing, evidence of all meter readings conducted on or about the Effective Time in connection with the Assets, together with all data necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to   Section 2.2  .  Taxes (other than Taxes measured by gross proceeds, income, profits or capital gains), surface use fees, insurance premiums and other Operating Expenses that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable period falling before and at or after the Effective Time, except that production, severance and similar Taxes measured by units of production shall be prorated based on the amount of Hydrocarbons actually produced, purchased or sold, as applicable, before, or at and after the Effective Time.  In each case, Purchaser shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period at and after the Effective Time and Seller shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period before the Effective Time.

If, after the Parties  agreement upon the Final Settlement Statement, (i) any Party receives monies belonging to the other pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including proceeds of production, then such amount shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the end of the month in which such amounts were received, be paid over to the proper Party, (ii) any Party pays monies for Operating Expenses which are the obligation of the other Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then such other Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the end of the month in which the applicable invoice and proof of payment of such invoice were received, reimburse the Party which paid such Operating Expenses, (iii) a Party receives an invoice of an expense or obligation which is owed by the other Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, such Party receiving the invoice shall promptly forward such invoice to the Party obligated to pay the same, and (iv) an invoice or other evidence of an obligation is received by a Party, which is partially an obligation of both Seller and Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the Parties shall consult with each other, and each shall promptly pay its portion of such obligation to the obligee. 
  (f)        Possession of any (i) cash call funds received and held by Seller as operator of the Assets but not expended pursuant to a joint operating agreement prior to Closing, and (ii) other Third Party funds being held by Seller as operator of the Assets shall be credited by Seller to Purchaser at Closing pursuant to   Section 2.2(e)  .    
  (g)        JIB Expense and JIB Credit Audit  . As soon as reasonably practicable following December 31, 2016, Seller and Purchaser shall, at Purchaser s sole expense, jointly conduct a joint interest audit in accordance with each applicable joint operating agreement or unit  
  
     12 

operating agreement (the    JIB Audit   ) with respect to all JIB Expenses actually paid and all JIB Credits actually received, in each case, by Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates that are attributable to any JIB for the calendar year of 2016.  If a particular operator under a joint operating agreement or unit operating agreement that constitutes a Contract is unable to support a physical audit within this timeframe, a review of activity date information provided by such operator is acceptable.  With respect to any JIB Audit exceptions, (i) Seller shall control with respect to any exception attributable to any period prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) Purchaser shall control with respect to any exception attributable to any period from and after the Effective Time.  Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in the conduct of the JIB Audit.  If following completion of the JIB Audit, the Parties determine that (A) (1) Seller paid any amount of JIB Expenses attributable to any period on or after the Effective Time, or (2) Purchaser received any JIB Credit attributable to any period prior to the Effective Time, then, in each case, Seller shall be entitled to reimbursement from Purchaser for such amount to the extent no Purchase Price adjustment was effected pursuant to   Section 2.2   with respect to such payment of JIB Expenses or (B) (1) Purchaser paid any amount of JIB Expenses attributable to any period prior to the Effective Time, or (2) Seller received any JIB Credit attributable to any period from and after the Effective Time, then, in each case, Purchaser shall be entitled to reimbursement from Seller for such amount to the extent no Purchase Price adjustment was effected pursuant to   Section 2.2   with respect to such receipt of JIB Credit.  Any such post-JIB Audit reimbursement obligation owed pursuant to this   Section 1.3(g)   shall be made within five (5) days following completion of the JIB Audit and shall be made by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Party receiving such reimbursement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, pursuant to the JIB Audit, it is determined that each Party owes a reimbursement amount to the other Party, the Party with the greater reimbursement obligation shall pay to the other Party, a net amount equal to such Party s reimbursement obligation owed to the other Party reduced by the reimbursement amount owed to such Party. If following the completion of the JIB Audit, either Party disputes whether any JIB Expense or JIB Credit is attributable to any period prior to or after the Effective Time, the dispute shall be resolved by the accounting firm set forth in   Section 9.4(b)   or if such accounting firm is unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under this Section, such other nationally recognized independent accounting firm as may be accepted by Purchaser and Seller, for review and final determination.  Purchaser shall bear the costs and expenses of the JIB Audit.  Any payments made pursuant to this   Section 1.3(g)   shall be deemed to constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price.

  (f)        Subject to the special warranty of title contained in the Conveyance,   Section 3.4(d)   shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with respect to any Title Defect, and Purchaser hereby waives any and all other rights or remedies with respect thereto. 
  (g)        The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined as follows: 
  
     20 

(i)        if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount; 
  (ii)        if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the affected Title Defect Property; 
  (iii)        if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest for any Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated on   Exhibit A-1   for such Property, and there is a proportional decrease of the Working Interest with respect thereto, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value for the affected Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the decrease between the Net Revenue Interest with respect to such Title Defect Property as stated on   Exhibit A-1   and the actual Net Revenue Interest held by Seller with respect to such Title Defect Property and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on   Exhibit A-1  , provided that if the Title Defect is not effective or does not affect a Property throughout its entire term, the Title Defect Amount determined under this   Section 3.4(g)(iii)   shall be reduced accordingly; 
  (iv)        if the Title Defect represents an Encumbrance of a type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property so affected, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the affected Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;  
  (v)        notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this   Article 3  , (A) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to any given Title Defect Property shall not exceed the lesser of (I) the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and (II) the cost to cure such Title Defects and (B) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect Property for which the aggregate Title Defect Amount(s) relating thereto do not exceed Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the    Individual Title Threshold   ), and then only to the extent the (I) aggregate amount of all Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Threshold, but excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller prior to Closing,   minus   (II) the aggregate amount of all Title Benefit Amounts, exceeds Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the    Title Defect Deductible   ), after which point any adjustments to the Purchase Price for such Title Defects shall be applicable only with respect to the Title Defect Amounts attributable to such Title Defects that are in excess of the Title Defect Deductible; and  
  (vi)        the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses (A) included in another Title Defect Amount hereunder, (B) included in any remedy for a Casualty Loss under   Section 3.6  , or  
  
     21 

(C) for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price.  
  (h)        If Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount. If Purchaser and Seller do not agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then the Title Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Property, the portion of such Property affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Property and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation. 
  (i)        Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on the existence of Title Defects, Title Benefits, any curative matters, all Title Defect Amounts and all Title Benefit Amounts by three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.  If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree by that date, a numerical average of Purchaser s good faith estimate and Seller s good faith estimate shall be used to determine the Closing Payment pursuant to   Section 9.4(a)   and the Title Defects, Title Benefits, curative matters, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this   Section 3.4(i)  .  During the 10-day period following the Closing Date, Title Defects, Title Benefits, curative matters, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be submitted to an attorney with at least ten (10) years  experience in Gulf of Mexico oil and gas titles as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller or absent such agreement during the 10-day period, by the Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association (the    Title Arbitrator   ).  The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section.  The Title Arbitrator s determination shall be made within 30 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal.  In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in   Sections 3.4(g)   and   3.4(h)   and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination.  Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the arbitrator, including title attorneys from other states and petroleum engineers.  In no event shall any Title Defect Amount exceed the estimate given by Purchaser in its claim notice delivered in accordance with   Section 3.4(a)   and in no event shall any Title Benefit Amount exceed the estimate given by Seller, as applicable, in a claim notice delivered in accordance with   Section 3.4(b)  .  The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the existence of any Title Defect or Title Benefit, the effect of any disputed curative matters and the specific disputed Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.  Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case.  Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator. 
   
  Section 3.5        Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase  . 
  (a)        Promptly after the Execution Date, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Execution Date, Seller shall prepare and send (i) notices in form and substance  
  
     22 

substantially similar to that attached hereto as   Exhibit F   and that have been approved by Purchaser in its reasonable discretion (each a    Consent Request Notice   ), to the holders of any Consents set forth on   Schedule 5.12   in compliance with the terms of such consents and requesting consents to the Conveyance and, to the extent applicable, an express waiver of any provision that would require the assignment of the applicable Asset subject to such Consent to be delayed until after the Closing Date, and (ii) notices in form and substance substantially similar to that attached hereto as   Exhibit G   and that have been approved by Purchaser in its reasonable discretion (each a    Preferential Right Notice   ), to the holders of any Preferential Rights set forth on   Schedule 5.12   in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights. With respect to each Consent (other than a Customary Post-Closing Consent) or Preferential Right that is not set forth on   Schedule 5.12   but is discovered by Seller prior to Closing, as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of any such Preferential Right or Consent, Seller shall prepare and send (A) a Consent Request Notice to the holders of any such Consents in compliance with the terms of such consents and requesting consents to the Conveyance and, to the extent applicable, an express waiver of any provision that would require the assignment of the applicable Asset subject to such Consent to be delayed until after the Closing Date, and (B) a Preferential Right Notice to the holders of any such Preferential Rights in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights.  Seller shall provide Purchaser with a copy of all notices sent to applicable Preferential Right and Consent holders.  Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Consents and waivers of Preferential Rights (or the exercise thereof) required to be requested pursuant to this   Section 3.5(a)   to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing.  Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such Consents and waivers of Preferential Rights, including providing reasonably requested financial and other information, and for the avoidance of doubt Purchaser shall not be permitted to (I) take any action intended to frustrate the receipt of any Consent or waiver or (II) to cause any contract or agreement to become an Excluded Asset by refusing to take assignment thereof or refusing to grant any Consent or waiver.   
  (b)        Any Preferential Right must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.  The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of Preferential Right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset.   
  (c)        (i) If any Preferential Right is exercised prior to Closing, or (ii) if prior to the Closing, the time period in which the holder of a Preferential Right has the right to exercise such Preferential Right has not yet expired and such holder has not waived such Preferential Right, then, in each case (A) the Assets subject to such Preferential Right shall be excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, (B) the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the Allocated Values of the Assets so excluded and (C) subject to   Section 3.5(d)  , such Assets so excluded shall become Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder. 
  (d)        With respect to any Preferential Right described in   Section 3.5(c)(i)   or   Section 3.5(c)(ii)   above (i) if for any reason (A) the purchase and sale of the Assets covered by such Preferential Right is not or cannot be consummated with the holder of such Preferential Right in accordance with the instrument under which such Preferential Right arises, or (B) the holder of the Preferential Right is unable to satisfy the conditions to closing contained therein, or (ii) the period in which to exercise such Preferential Right has expired without the exercise thereof, then, in each  
  
     23 

case, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser and, if less than 180 days have elapsed since the Closing Date, then, within ten (10) Business Days after Purchaser s receipt of such notice, the Parties shall conduct an additional closing whereby Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and accept from Seller, such previously Excluded Assets (1) for the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at the initial Closing with respect to such Excluded Assets (subject to any applicable adjustments contained in   Section 2.2   with respect to such Excluded Assets and any applicable closing conditions), (2) pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the Conveyance, except the  Closing Date  with respect to any such Excluded Asset shall mean the date of assignment of such Excluded Asset from Seller to Purchaser, and (3) thereafter, such previously Excluded Assets shall become Assets for all purposes hereunder.  
  (e)        All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Right has been waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable Preferential Right has expired without the applicable Preferential Right having been validly exercised, in each case, prior to Closing, shall be transferred to Purchaser at Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.  With respect to any Preferential Right, until the Assets subject to such Preferential Right are transferred to Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, Seller shall control any dispute between Seller and a holder of a Preferential Right with respect to such Preferential Right. 
  (f)        If Seller fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and (i) the failure to obtain such Consent would cause (A) the assignment of the Assets affected thereby to Purchaser to be void or voidable, (B) the termination of (or the right to terminate) a Lease or other Asset under the express terms thereof, or (C) any material Liability to the transferee of such Asset, (ii) the Consent requested by Seller is denied in writing, or (iii) the Consent is required from a Governmental Authority (other than a Customary Post-Closing Consent), (x) the Assets subject to or otherwise affected by such Consent shall be excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, (y) the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the Allocated Values of the Assets so excluded and (z) subject to   Section 3.5(g)  , such Assets so excluded shall become Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder; provided however that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may elect, by written notice to Seller prior to Closing, to receive an assignment of such affected Assets (including all Assets subject to or otherwise affected by such Consent), and such Assets shall be assigned to Purchaser at Closing and shall not be Excluded Assets, and   Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for all Liabilities arising out of such assignment as if such Liabilities were Assumed Obligations hereunder  .  
  (g)        In the event that any such Consent (with respect to an Asset excluded pursuant to   Section 3.5(f)  ) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser and, if less than 270 days have elapsed since the Closing Date, then, within ten (10) Business Days after Purchaser s receipt of such notice, the Parties shall conduct an additional closing whereby Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and accept from Seller, such previously Excluded Assets (1) for the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at the initial Closing with respect to such Excluded Assets (subject to any applicable adjustments contained in   Section 2.2   with respect to such Excluded Assets and any applicable closing conditions), (2) pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the Conveyance, except the  Closing Date  with respect to any such Excluded Asset shall mean the date of assignment  
  
     24 

of such Excluded Asset from Seller to Purchaser, and (3) thereafter, such previously Excluded Assets shall become Assets for all purposes hereunder. 
  (h)        If Seller fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and (i) the failure to obtain such Consent would not cause (A) the assignment of the Asset (or portion thereof) affected thereby to Purchaser to be void or voidable, (B) the termination of (or the right to terminate) a Lease or other Asset under the express terms thereof, or (C) any material Liability to the transferee of such Asset, (ii) such Consent requested by Seller is not denied in writing by the holder thereof, and (iii) such Consent is not required from a Governmental Authority (or is a Customary Post-Closing Consent) then, the Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Purchaser at Closing as part of the Assets. 
  (i)        Prior to Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents required to be requested pursuant to this   Section 3.5   and waivers of all Preferential Rights; in addition, following the Closing, Seller agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser to obtain any Consents and waivers of Preferential Rights that were not obtained prior to Closing, regardless of whether or not the affected Assets were excluded from the transactions at Closing. 
  (j)        If a Consent has not been obtained prior to Closing and Seller has otherwise complied with the provisions of this   Section 3.5  , Purchaser shall have no claim against Seller and Seller shall have no Liability for the failure to obtain such Consent; provided, that, upon the agreement of the Parties, the Parties shall have executed and delivered such instruments and taken such other actions as the Parties may mutually agree to carry out the intent of this Agreement and the transfer of the benefits and burdens of such Assets to Purchaser.      Such instruments and actions may include the execution of back-to-back agreements to effect the transfer to Purchaser of the benefits and burdens of such Assets which Seller is obligated to perform and/or is entitled to receive, as applicable (provided that entering into such back-to-back agreements is not impracticable or does not: (x) result in a breach of any obligations under any such Assets, (y) result in a violation of Law or (z) impose a burden on Seller or Purchaser disproportionate to the benefit received by Purchaser under such Asset).  In any such back-to-back agreement (whether in writing or otherwise), (i) Seller shall continue to be bound thereby and (ii) (A) Seller shall, without further consideration therefor, pay, assign and remit to Purchaser promptly all monies, rights and other considerations received in respect of such Asset, (B) Seller shall continue to operate the Assets in compliance with   Section 7.3  , (C) Seller shall promptly exercise or exploit the beneficial rights and options of Purchaser under such Asset at Purchaser s request and expense, (D) if and when any such Consent shall be obtained or such an Asset shall otherwise become assignable, Seller shall promptly assign, in a manner consistent with   Section 2.1  , its rights and obligations under such Asset to Purchaser and   Purchaser shall, without the payment of any further consideration therefor (if the Purchase Price was not reduced at the initial Closing with respect to such Asset) or in exchange for the payment by Purchaser of the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at the initial Closing with respect to such Excluded Asset (subject to any applicable adjustments contained in   Section 2.2   with respect to such Excluded Asset), assume such rights and obligations, and (E)     Purchaser shall perform and discharge fully all of the obligations of Seller thereunder after the Effective Time and indemnify Seller for all Liabilities arising out of such performance by  
  
     25 

Purchaser as if such obligations and Liabilities were Assumed Obligations hereunder; provided, however, Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify Seller to the extent any such Liability arises from, or is attributable to (1) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Seller Indemnified Party or (2) Seller s breach of any provision of this   Section 3.5(j)  .    To the extent that Seller is unable to assign an Asset with respect to which the Parties have elected that this   Section 3.5(j)   applies, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to seek the Consent applicable to such Asset until the earlier of (I) the third anniversary of the Closing Date or (II) the date such Asset terminates in accordance with its terms or otherwise at the direction of Purchaser. 
   
  Section 3.6        Casualty or Condemnation Loss  .  
  (a)        From the Execution Date until Closing, Seller shall provide written notice to Purchaser of any (i) physical damage to a Well or any Equipment, and any Environmental Defect resulting therefrom or arising in connection therewith, that occurs and (A) is not the result of normal wear and tear, mechanical failure or gradual structural deterioration of materials, equipment, and infrastructure, or reservoir changes or depletion due to normal production (including (1) failures arising or occurring during drilling or completing operations, (2) junked or lost holes, or (3) sidetracking or deviating a well), and (B) is a result of acts of God, fire, explosion, pipeline or gathering line failure, earthquake, hurricane, tropical storm, tropical depression, storm, windstorm or blowout or (ii) any condemnation or other taking related to any Asset that occurs (each, a    Casualty Loss   ) (provided that Casualty Loss shall not include any physical damage related to Decommissioning and NORM). Such written notice shall be provided promptly upon Seller becoming aware of any Casualty Loss and shall include, to the extent known by Seller at such time, (I) a reasonably detailed description of the events leading to such Casualty Loss, (II) a description of the Equipment and/or Wells affected by such Casualty Loss and (III) Seller s estimate of the costs to repair or replace the Equipment and/or Wells affected by such Casualty Loss. 
  (b)        From the Execution Date until Closing, should any Property suffer a Casualty Loss in an amount that exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), net to Seller s interest in the applicable  Property, then (subject to   Section 8.1  ,   Section 8.2   and   Section 10.1  ) Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to proceed to Closing and Seller may elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing to either (A) require Seller, at Seller s sole cost, expense and Liability (to the extent Purchaser does not otherwise own an interest in such Property), to repair or restore (or cause to be repaired or restored, including debris and wreck removal to the extent required by applicable Law) any such Property affected by such Casualty Loss to a quality and condition comparable to that existing with respect to such Property immediately before such Casualty Loss, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date, so long as Seller is diligently pursuing such repairs or restoration activities but not longer than one hundred eighty (180) Days after the Closing Date unless mutually acceptable to the Parties), (B) reduce the Purchase Price by an amount that would be necessary to repair or restore (or cause to be repaired or restored, including debris and wreck removal to the extent required by applicable Law) any such Property affected by such Casualty Loss to a quality and condition comparable to that existing with respect to such Equipment or Well immediately before such Casualty Loss, or (C) (I) cause the Property affected by such Casualty Loss to be excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, (II)  
  
     26 

have such excluded Asset (or portion thereof) to be an  Excluded Asset  for all purposes hereunder, and (III) reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Excluded Asset. 
  (c)        Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on the amount of the costs and expenses associated with Casualty Losses prior to Closing.  If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement by Closing, then a numerical average of Purchaser s good faith estimate and Seller s good faith estimate thereof shall be used at the Closing and either Party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with   Section 4.2(g)   within the 10-day period following the Closing Date to resolve the amount of the costs and expenses associated with Casualty Losses.

     28 

Excluded Assets  for all purposes hereunder, and (C) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Values of all such Excluded Assets, provided, that if the Parties are unable to mutually agree to any such remedy, then (I) if the Remediation Amount is less than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000), the Parties shall be deemed to have selected the option in subsection (i) above, or (II) if the Remediation Amount is greater than or equal to Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000), the Parties shall be deemed to have selected the option in subsection (ii) above.

  (f)        The Remediation Amount with respect to an Environmental Defect Property shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses (i) included in another Remediation Amount hereunder, (ii) included in any remedy for a Casualty Loss under   Section 3.6  , or (iii) for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price.  
  (g)        Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on the existence of Environmental Defects, any Remediation matters and all Remediation Amounts by three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall timely file any Tax Returns with respect to Asset Taxes required to be filed after the Closing Date, including such Tax Returns for any Straddle Period (a    Post-Closing Tax Return   ), and shall pay any Asset Taxes shown due and owing on such Post-Closing Tax Return, subject to Purchaser s right to reimbursement for any Asset Taxes for which Seller is responsible under   Section 7.6(a)  .  Purchaser shall file any Post-Closing Tax Return relating to a Straddle Period in a manner consistent with past practice.  Within fifteen (15) days prior to filing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a draft of any such Pre-Closing Tax Return for Purchaser s review and approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  Within fifteen (15) days prior to filing, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a draft of any such Post-Closing Tax Return for Seller s review and approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  The Parties agree that (i) this   Section 7.6(c)   is intended to solely address the timing and manner in which certain Tax returns relating to Asset Taxes are filed and the Asset Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable Taxing Authority, and  
  
     50 

(ii) nothing in this   Section 7.6(c)   shall be interpreted as altering the manner in which Asset Taxes are allocated to and economically borne by the Parties. 
  (d)        Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing upon receipt by Seller of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the income, properties or operations of Seller (for the avoidance of doubt, other than pending or threatened Income Tax audits or assessments) of Seller that are reasonably expected to give rise to a lien or Encumbrance on the Assets after the Closing Date.  Each of Purchaser and Seller shall promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment challenging the Allocation Schedule or that otherwise could give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. 
  (e)        Any payments made to any Party pursuant to   Section 1.3(g)  ,   Section 7.6(b)   or   Article 11   shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by Purchaser and Seller on their Tax returns to the extent permitted by Law. 
  (f)        Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, each Party shall have the right to structure the transactions contemplated under the terms of this Agreement as a non-simultaneous like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code, and its implementing Treasury Regulations (a    Like-Kind Exchange   ).  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in connection with effectuating a Like-Kind Exchange, each Party shall have the right, at or prior to the Closing Date or any subsequent closing, to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement (the    Assigned Rights   ) to a  qualified intermediary  (as that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) or to a  qualified exchange accommodation titleholder  (as that term is defined in U.S. Revenue Procedure 2000-37).  In the event a Party (in its capacity as an exchanging party, referred to in this   Section 7.6(f)   as an    Exchanging Party   ) assigns the Assigned Rights to a  qualified intermediary  pursuant to this   Section 7.6(f)  , then such Exchanging Party agrees to notify the other Party in writing of such assignment reasonably in advance of the Closing Date.  In addition, should a Party choose to effectuate a Like-Kind Exchange, the Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one another in the completion of such an exchange, including the execution of all documents reasonably necessary to effectuate such a Like-Kind Exchange; provided, however, that (a) the Closing Date shall not be delayed or affected by reason of the Like-Kind Exchange, (b) the Exchanging Party shall effect its Like-Kind Exchange through an assignment of the Assigned Rights to a  qualified intermediary  or to a  qualified exchange accommodation titleholder,  but such assignment shall not release such Exchanging Party from any of its liabilities or obligations under this Agreement and (c) the non-Exchanging Party shall incur no additional unreimbursed costs, expenses, fees or liabilities as a result of or in connection with the exchange requested by the Exchanging Party.  Each of Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge and agree that any assignment of this Agreement pursuant to this   Section 7.6(f)   shall not release a Party from, or modify, any of its respective liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other) under this Agreement.  Neither Party, by its consent to a Like-Kind Exchange, shall be responsible in any way for the Exchanging Party s compliance with such Like-Kind Exchange.

As soon as reasonably practicable after Closing, Purchaser shall record the Conveyance in the appropriate recording jurisdictions as well as with the appropriate Governmental Authorities, shall make all filings necessary to be made with any Governmental Authority to effectuate the transfer of the Assets and shall provide Seller with copies of all recorded, filed or approved instruments.

Seller shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) enter into any agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or directly related to, or which is reasonably likely to lead to, a Third Party Acquisition or any proposal for a Third Party Acquisition. 
   
  Section 7.10        Representations and Warranties  .

The Parties shall provide to each other such information as the other Party may reasonably request in writing as is necessary for Purchaser to evaluate the Employees, for the Parties to comply with and implement the terms and conditions of   Sections 7.12   through   7.20   and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  (d)        In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.  The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such 30 day period (or such shorter period until notification from the Indemnifying Party is received), at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. 
  (e)        If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, such Third Party Claim.  The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof.  If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest (provided that in no event shall an Indemnified Party be obligated to bring any cross-complaint or counterclaim against any Person).  The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, at its own expense, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this   Section 11.3(e)  .  An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity). 
  (f)        If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute or settle such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (to the extent the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified Party s choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof.  If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the Liability and consent to such settlement, (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement, or (iii) deny liability.  If the Indemnified Party settles any Third Party Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Party after the Indemnifying Party has timely admitted its obligation in writing and has actually assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified  
  
     70 

Party shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity for such claim.  Any failure to respond to such notice by the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an election under subsection (i) above.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this   Section 11.3  , if the Indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to the Indemnified Party under this   Section 11.3   and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to bear any costs and expenses of the Third Party Claim or the Indemnified Party s defense pursuant to this   Section 11.3   and, to the extent incurred by the Indemnifying Party, such costs and expenses shall be promptly reimbursed by the Indemnified Party. 
  (g)        In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its liability for such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities.  If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30 day period that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for such Liabilities, the amount of such Liabilities shall conclusively be deemed a Liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

 EXHIBIT 95.1

Exhibit 95.1 
    
  Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Safety Data 
    
  FCX's U.S. mining operations are subject to regulations issued by MSHA under the U.S. Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act). MSHA inspects our U.S. mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it also generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, related to the alleged violation. Citations or orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments varies depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine, among other factors.  
    
  The following disclosures have been provided pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act). 
    
  Mine Safety Data  . Following provides additional information about references used in the table below to describe the categories of violations, orders or citations issued by MSHA under the Mine Act: 

Section 104 S S Citations  : Citations issued by MSHA under Section 104(a) of the Mine Act for violations of health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to a serious injury if left unabated.  

Section 104(b) Orders  : Orders issued under Section 104(b) of the Mine Act, which represent a failure to abate a citation under Section 104(a) within the period prescribed by MSHA. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated. 

Section 104(d) Citations and Orders  : Citations and orders issued by MSHA under Section 104(d) of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety standards. These types of violations could significantly and substantially contribute to a serious injury; however, the conditions do not cause imminent danger (refer to discussion of imminent danger orders below). 

Section 110(b)(2) Violations  : Flagrant violations identified by MSHA under Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. The term flagrant with respect to a violation is defined as  a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health or safety standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury.  

Section 107(a) Orders  : Orders issued by MSHA under Section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an imminent danger existed. Orders issued under Section 107(a) of the Mine Act require the operator of the mine to cause all persons (except authorized persons) to be withdrawn from the mine until the imminent danger and the conditions that caused such imminent danger cease to exist. 

The following table details the violations, citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  :  

(1) 
    MSHA assigns an identification number to each mine or operation and may or may not assign separate identification numbers to related facilities.  
              (2) 
    Amounts represent the total dollar value of proposed assessments received on or before   October 31, 2016  , for citations or orders issued by MSHA during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . FCX is currently contesting approximately $40 thousand of these proposed assessments.  

Pending Legal Actions  .   The table below provides a summary of legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) as well as the aggregate number of legal actions instituted and resolved during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Commission is an independent adjudicative agency established by the Mine Act that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act. These cases may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and penalties they have received from MSHA, or complaints of discrimination by miners under Section 105 of the Mine Act.  

The following provides additional information of the types of proceedings that may be brought before the Commission: 
             
    Contest Proceedings   - A contest proceeding may be filed by an operator to challenge the issuance of a citation or order issued by MSHA. 
                
    Civil Penalty Proceedings   - A civil penalty proceeding may be filed by an operator to challenge a civil penalty MSHA has proposed for a violation contained in a citation or order. FCX does not institute civil penalty proceedings based solely on the assessment amount of proposed penalties. Any initiated adjudications described in the table below address substantive matters of law and policy instituted on conditions that are alleged to be in violation of mandatory standards or the Mine Act.  
                
    Discrimination Proceedings   - Involves a miner's allegation that he or she has suffered adverse employment action because he or she engaged in activity protected under the Mine Act, such as making a safety complaint. Also includes temporary reinstatement proceedings involving cases in which a miner has filed a complaint with MSHA stating that he or she has suffered discrimination and the miner has lost his or her position. 
                
    Compensation Proceedings   - A compensation proceeding may be filed by miners entitled to compensation when a mine is closed by certain closure orders issued by MSHA. The purpose of the proceeding is to determine the amount of compensation, if any, due to miners idled by the orders.   
                
    Temporary Relief -   Applications for temporary relief are applications filed under section 105(b)(2) of the Mine Act for temporary relief from any modification or termination of any order. 
                
    Appeals -   An appeal may be filed by an operator to challenge judges decisions or orders to the commission, including petitions for discretionary review and review by the commission on its own motion. 

(1) 
    MSHA assigns an identification number to each mine or operation and may or may not assign separate identification numbers to related facilities. Refer to "Mine Safety Data" table for related mine or operation name.  
              (2) 
    Legal actions pending at   September 30, 2016  , and legal actions instituted during the three month period are based on the date that a docket number was assigned to the proceeding.  
              (3) 
    Legal actions resolved during the three month period are based on the date that the settlement motion resolving disputed matters is filed with the Commission and the matter is effectively closed by MSHA.
