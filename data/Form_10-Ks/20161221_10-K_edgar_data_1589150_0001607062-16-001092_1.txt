CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

This
annual report on Form 10-K and other reports that we file with the SEC contain statements that are considered forward-looking
statements.  Forward-looking statements give the Company s current expectations, plans, objectives, assumptions
or forecasts of future events. All statements other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this annual report,
including statements regarding the Company s future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs and
plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
statements by terminology such as  anticipate,   estimate,   plans,   potential, 
 projects,   ongoing,   expects,   management believes,   we believe, 
 we intend,  and similar expressions. These statements are based on the Company s current plans and are subject
to risks and uncertainties, and as such the Company s actual future activities and results of operations may be materially
different from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this annual
report may turn out to be inaccurate and as such, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  The
Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events and
financial trends that it believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.
The forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions
due to a number of factors, including:  

dependence on key personnel;   

competitive factors;   

degree of success of research and development programs   

the operation of our business; and   

general economic conditions   

These
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and except to the extent required by federal securities
laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on
which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of
each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable
to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained
in this annual report.  

PART
I   

Item
1. Business   

We
were incorporated April 24, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are a controlled subsidiary of Bio-Matrix Scientific
Group, Inc, a Delaware corporation. We intend to engage primarily in the development of regenerative medical applications which
we intend to license from other entities up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials after
which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further
to Phase III clinical trials. The primary factor to be considered by us in arriving at a decision to advance an application further
to Phase III clinical trials would be a greater than anticipated indication of efficacy seen in Phase I trials.  

As
of December 13, 2015 , we have not licensed any existing therapies which may be marketed. On June 23, 2015 Regen Biopharma, Inc.
(  Regen ) entered into an agreement ( Agreement ) with Zander Therapeutics, Inc. (  Zander )
whereby Regen granted to Zander an exclusive worldwide right and license for the development and commercialization of certain
intellectual property controlled by Regen (  License IP ) for non-human veterinary therapeutic use for a term of fifteen
years. Zander is a wholly owned subsidiary of Entest Biomedical, Inc.  

Pursuant
to the Agreement, Zander shall pay to Regen one-time, non-refundable, upfront payment of one hundred thousand US dollars ($100,000)
as a license initiation fee which must be paid within 90 days of June 23, 2015 and an annual non-refundable payment of one hundred
thousand US dollars ($100,000) on on July 15th, 2016 and each subsequent anniversary of the effective date of the Agreement.  

  The
abovementioned payments may be made, at Zander s discretion, in cash or newly issued common stock of Zander or in common
stock of Entest BioMedical Inc. valued as of the lowest closing price on the principal exchange upon which said common stock trades
publicly within the 14 trading days prior to issuance.  

Pursuant
to the Agreement, Zander shall pay to Regen royalties equal to four percent (4%) of the Net Sales , as such term is defined in
the Agreement, of any Licensed Products, as such term is defined in the Agreement, in a Quarter.  

Pursuant
to the Agreement, Zander will pay Regen ten percent (10%) of all consideration (in the case of in-kind consideration, at fair
market value as monetary consideration) received by Zander from sublicensees ( excluding royalties from sublicensees based on
Net Sales of any Licensed Products for which Regen receives payment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement).  

Zander
is obligated pay to Regen minimum annual royalties of ten thousand US dollars ($10,000) payable per year on each anniversary of
the Effective Date of this Agreement, commencing on the second anniversary of June 23, 2015. This minimum annual royalty is only
payable to the extent that royalty payments made during the preceding 12-month period do not exceed ten thousand US dollars ($10,000).  

The
Agreement may be terminated by Regen:  

If
Zander has not sold any Licensed Product by ten years of the effective date of the Agreement or Zander has not sold any Licensed
Product for any twelve (12) month period after Zander s first commercial sale of a Licensed Product.  

The
Agreement may be terminated by Zander with regard to any of the License IP if by five years from the date of execution of the
Agreement a patent has not been granted by the United States patent and Trademark Office to Regen with regard to that License
IP.  

The
Agreement may be terminated by Zander with regard to any of the License IP if a patent that has been granted by the United States
patent and Trademark Office to Regen with regard to that License IP is terminated.  

The
Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party.  

David
R. Koos serves as sole officer and director of both Zander and Entest Biomedical, Inc. and also serves as Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Regen.  

Zander
will be required to obtain approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in order to market
any Licensed Product which may be developed within the United States and no assurance may be given that such approval would be
granted.  

We
have acquired certain intellectual property from Dr. Wei Ping Min on May 1, 2013and licensed certain intellectual property from
Benitec Australia Limited on August 5, 2013. These collective intellectual properties comprise the therapeutic concept behind
dCellVax , a cancer therapy in early stage development by the Company.

all right, title and interest in US Patent # 8,389,708 as well as all Patent applications from the same family corresponding to
numbers PCT/CA2006/000984, CA2612200 and EP1898936.( Min IP ) US Patent # 8,389,708 was granted to Min with regard
to his invention of a method directed to the silencing of immunosuppressive cancer causing genes using short interfering RNA (siRNA)
leading to an increase in the immune response, a decrease in tumor-induced immunosuppression and a decrease in in vivo tumor progression.

On
November 9, 2016 the Company formed Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  

Principal
Products and Services   

HemaXellarate
I   

The
Company has begun development of HemaXellerate I, a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow. HemaXellerate I is
a patient-specific composition of cells that have been demonstrated to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of
blood cells based on previous animal studies. The initial application of HemaXellerate I will be the treatment of severe aplastic
anemia which is characterized by immune-mediated bone marrow hypoplasia (underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue)
and pancytopenia (reduction in the number of blood cells and platelets).  

Adipose
tissue is collected from the patient and processed in order to separate, extract and isolate Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF),
a mix of various cell types including mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. Mesenchymal stem cells are connective tissue
cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types and endothelial cells are the cells that line the interior surface of
blood vessels and lymphatic vessels and which play a vital role in angiogenesis ( the physiological process through which new
blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels).  

The
isolated SVF is then intravenously administered to the patient. The Company believes that the isolated SVF will generate growth
factors with the ability to repair damaged hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells are immature cells that can develop
into all types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Hematopoietic stem cells are found
in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow.  

On
February 5, 2013 Regen filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration
( FDA ) to initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate I I in patients with drug-refractory aplastic
anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous
SVF cells in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility
and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse.  

Under
the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a previously unapproved drug or biologic intended
to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually
in the United States. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval
for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven year period of marketing exclusivity,
which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for that time period. The sponsor of the
product would also be entitled to a United States federal tax credit equal to 50% of clinical investigation expenses as well as
exemptions from certain fees.  

The
Company believes that this application of HemaXellerate I qualifies for Orphan designation under the Orphan Drug Act due to the
fact that aplastic anemia is a rare disease with prevalence in the United States of less than 200,000 and intends to apply to
the FDA for Orphan designation for HemaXellerate.  

On
December 10, 2015 Regen was informed by the United States Food and Drug Administration that Regen has satisfactorily addressed
all clinical hold issues related to Regen s Investigational New Drug Application for HemaXellerate I and may initiate a
Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is
intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells
in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and
secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse.  

HemaXellerate
II   

Also
in early stage development by the Company is a version of HemaXellerate called HemaXellerate II.  

HemaXellerate
II is intended to be a universal donor endothelial cell based therapeutic and is intended to be manufactured by obtaining cells
from a part of the placenta called the  vascular lobules . The cells are processed and utilized for the purpose of
stimulating bone marrow hematopoetic stem cell repair and proliferation. The mechanism of action for HemaXellerate II is similar
to HemaXellerate I whereby the harvested and processed cells would produce growth factors which would mediate the therapeutic
effects of the product. The Company has not begun preclinical development of HemaXellerate II as of December 29, 2015.  

The
therapeutic concept behind the HemaXellerate products derives from intellectual property licensed to the Company by Oregon Health 
Science University (US patent No. 6,821,513  Method for enhancing hematopoiesis  issued Nov. 23, 2004) pursuant to
an agreement entered into by the parties on June 5, 2013. This agreement was terminated by mutual consent on August 8, 2013 due
to the fact that US patent No. 6,821,513 had expired due to nonpayment of the required maintenance fees by Oregon Health  
Science University. The Company has been informed by its counsel and believes that the expiration of US patent No. 6,821,513 signifies
that no party can be sued for future infringement based on the patent. Thus the Company is free to practice the claimed methods
recited in the expired patent in the future without being liable for patent infringement based on the patent.  

dCell
Vax    

dCellVax
is intended to be a therapy whereby dendritic cells of the cancer patient are harvested from the body , treated with plasmid DNA
that has the ability to block the dendritic cell from expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) and subsequently
reimplanted in the cancer patient.  

The
dendritic cells that are treated with the IDO-blocking plasmid become resistant to the influence of tumor cells which produce
factors which cause the dendritic cell to express the IDO. Expression of IDO on the dendritic cell halts the dendritic cell from
activating T cells and causes the dendritic cell to suppress T cells. T lymphocytes ( T cells ) are a lymphocyte that
play a central role in the human immune system s attempt to eradicate tumors. The Company has filed an Investigational New
Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to initiate a Phase I/II clinical
trial assessing safety with signals of efficacy of the dCellVax gene silenced dendritic cell immunotherapy for treating breast
cancer. The proposed trial will recruit 10 patients with metastatic breast cancer and will involve 4 monthly injections of the
dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell therapy. The trial is anticipated to l last one year, with tumor assessment before therapy
and at 6 and 12 months.  

The
concepts utilized in formulating dCellVax are derived  

(a)  
         
      from
    patented intellectual property acquitted by the Company from Dr. Wei Ping Min which is method directed to the silencing of
    immunosuppressive cancer causing genes using short interfering RNA (siRNA) and which has been granted patent protection under
    US Patent # 8,389,708   

(b)  
         
      from
    patented intellectual property licensed to the Company by Benitec.   

NR2F6   

Regen
has been assigned intellectual property with regard to the gene NR2F6 . It is believed by the Company that NR2F6 expression leads
to the shutting down of the immune system s natural ability to kill cancerous cells. The Company believes that identification
of a small molecule which could inhibit this receptor would potentially provide an avenue for immunotherapy of cancer.  

Tcellvax   

  Tcellvax
is intended to be an autologous cellular product comprised of NR2F6 gene-silenced peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It has been
demonstrated that mice genetically deficient for NR2F6 are capable of immunologically rejecting tumors. The Company has filed
an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to initiate
a clinical trial .The proposed clinical trial would be a single center, open label, non-randomized Phase I/II trial to test the
safety and efficacy of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells that have been gene-silenced for NR2F6 using short interfering
RNA (siRNA)  

Small
Molecules   

  The
Company is also actively identifying small molecules via a high throughput screening program that inhibit NR2F6 leading to immune
cell activation for oncology applications.  

On
December 15, 2015 Regen entered into an agreement ( Agreement ) with the National Center for Advancing Translational
Sciences ( NCATS ), which is a component of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ), an agency of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services whereby Regen and NCATS shall collaborate to screen for small molecule compounds
that activate or inhibit the orphan nuclear receptor, NR2F6.  

Regen
will be required to obtain approval from the FDA in order to market any of Regen s products or therapies. No approval has
been granted by the FDA for the marketing and sale of any of the Company s products and therapies and no assurance may be
given that any of the Company s products or therapies will be granted such approval. The Company s current plans include
the development of regenerative medical applications up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and/ or Phase II clinical
trials after which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application
further to Phase III clinical trials. We can provide no assurance that the Company will be able to sell or license any product
or that, if such product is sold or licensed, such sale or license will be on terms favorable to the Company.  

Distribution
methods of the products or services:   

  It
is anticipated that Regen will enter into licensing and/or sublicensing agreements with outside entities in order that Regen may
obtain royalty income on the products and services which it may develop and commercialize.  

Competitive
business conditions and Regen's competitive position in the industry and methods of competition   

We
are recently formed and have yet to achieve revenues or profits. The pharmaceutical and biologics industries in which we intend
to compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological advancement. Many of our competitors have greater resources
than we do.  

We
intend to be competitive by utilizing the services and advice of individuals that we believe have expertise in their field in
order that we can concentrate our resources on projects in which products and services in which we have the greatest potential
to secure a competitive advantage may be developed and commercialized .  

To
that effect, we have established a Scientific Advisory Board of (the Advisory Board) comprised of individuals who we believe have
a high level of expertise in their professional fields and who have agreed to provide counsel and assistance to us in (a) determining
the viability of proposed projects (b) obtaining financing for projects and (c) obtaining the resources required to initiate and
complete a project in the most cost effective and rapid manner.

domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals,
an Investigational New Drug Application ( IND ) must be filed with the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing.
Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to
demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans.  

Phase
I  

Phase
1 trials are designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug.
These trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. The subject who
receives the drug is usually observed until several half-lives of the drug have passed. Phase I trials normally include dose-ranging,
also called dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. The tested range of doses
usually are a fraction of the dose that causes harm in animal testing and involve a small group of healthy volunteers. However,
there are some circumstances when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment
options.  

Phase
II  

Phase
II trials are designed to assess how well the drug or biologic works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger
group of volunteers and patients. Phase II trials are performed on larger groups.  

Phase
III  

Phase
III trials are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the product is in comparison with current best standard
treatment and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials may also be conducted for the purposes of
(i)  label expansion  (to show the product works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for
which the drug was approved for marketing or (ii) to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the product.  

On
occasion Phase IV (Post Approval) trials may be required by the FDA. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance)
and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold.The safety surveillance is designed to detect
any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the
Phase I-III clinical trials.  

All
phases, must be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in
humans. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board ( IRB ).
The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.
The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development
initially required to create the product. No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until
an appropriate New Drug Application ( NDA ) or Biologic License Application ( BLA ) or has been approved
by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to NDA or BLA approval.  

Even
after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain
approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In addition, use
of these products during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent FDA marketing
approval, resulting in FDA-ordered product recall, or in FDA-imposed limitations on permissible  

The
FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be
produced in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMP ) . The FDA also regulates the content of
advertisements used to market pharmaceutical products. Generally, claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy
of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA
or an amendment to an NDA, and statements regarding the use of a product must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and
dosage information for that product.  

Sales
of drugs and biologics outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country
to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries
must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval
may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.  

Regen
has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA to initiate clinical trials assessing the company s
HemaXellerate I drug currently in development in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. Regen has also filed an IND to
initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial assessing safety with signals of efficacy of the dCellVax gene silenced dendritic cell immunotherapy
for treating breast cancer. The clinical trials for which the INDs were submitted may not commence until approval to commence
such trials has been granted to Regen by the FDA. On December 10, 2015 the Company was informed by the United States Food and
Drug Administration that Regen has satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold issues related to Regen s Investigational
New Drug Application for HemaXellerate and may initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate I in patients with drug-refractory
aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered
autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the
primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response,
partial response or relapse.

Item
5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities   

The
Company s common stock is a  penny stock,  as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. The penny stock
rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized
risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.
The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of
the broker-dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny
stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt
from such rules, must make a special written determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity
in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. So long as the common stock of the Company
is subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell common stock of the Company.  

The
Company s authorized capital stock consists of the following:  

  Common
stock, $ 0.0001 par value; 500,000,000 shares authorized: 145,212,605 shares issued and outstanding as of December 13, 2016.

cast that number of votes which is equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock owned by such holder times one (1).  

  On
any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall
receive, out of assets legally available for distribution to the Company s stockholders, a ratable share in the assets of
the Corporation.  

  Preferred
Stock, $0.0001 par value, 800,000,000 shares authorized of which 600,000 is designated as Series AA Preferred Stock: 30,000 shares

  The
abovementioned shares authorized pursuant to the Company s certificate of incorporation may be issued from time to time
without prior approval of the shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Company shall have the full authority permitted by law
to establish one or more series and the number of shares constituting each such series and to fix by resolution full or limited,
multiple or fractional, or no voting rights, and such designations, preferences, qualifications, restrictions, options, conversion
rights and other special or relative rights of any series of the Stock that may be desired.

As
of September 30, 2016, we had Cash in the amount of $ 24,822 and as of September 30, 2015 we had Cash in the amount of $38,620.  

The
decrease in Cash of approximately 35.7% is attributable to funds expended in the operation of the Company s business offset
by:  

(c)    Series
                                         A Preferred Stock of the Issuer sold for cash consideration of $628,563    

(d)    $50,000
                                         deposited with the Company by an unaffiliated investor pursuant to an agreement ( Agreement )
                                         whereby the investor agreed to buy and the Company agreed to sell 1,000,000 Units for
                                         consideration of $50,000. Each Unit issuable pursuant to the Agreement shall consist
                                         of one share of the Company s common stock and three shares of the Company s
                                         Series A Preferred Stock. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 the outside investor
                                         paid consideration to the Company of $50,000 for One Million Units. As of September 30,

As
of September 30, 2016 we had Prepaid Expenses of $ 69,905 and as of September 30, 2015 we had Prepaid Expenses of $10,000.  

The
increase in Prepaid Expenses of approximately 599% is primarily attributable to:  

(a)    Recognition
                                         of the fair market value of stock that was issued to a consultant to the Company as prepayment
                                         for services to be rendered, such fair market value being $68,905,     

Offset
by:  

$10,000
of salary prepaid to the Company s former Chief Scientific Officer having been reclassified during the quarter ended December
31, 2015 as amounts Due from Former Employee as a result of the resignation of the Company s former Chief Scientific Officer

As
of September 30, 2016 we had Accounts Receivable of $ 83,000 and as of September 30, 2015 we had Accounts Receivable of $0.

30,2016 such revenue consisting of a $100,000 fee ( Fee ) due and payable to the Company by Zander Therapeutics, Inc.
pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement ( Agreement ) with Zander Therapeutics, Inc. (  Zander )
whereby The Company granted to Zander an exclusive worldwide right and license for the development and commercialization of certain

Securities of $158,400

of Entest Biomedical, Inc. owned by the Company.  

As
of September 30, 2016 we had Accounts Payable of $240,759 and as of September 30, 2015 we had Accounts payable of $25,854.

of $0.

  (b)
the issuance by the Company of a convertible note in the face amount of $50,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.

of $0.  

  Amount
due to Shareholder of $50,000 as of September 30, 2016 is attributable to the following:  

  On
July 13, 2016 the Company entered into an agreement ( Agreement ) with an outside investor whereby the investor agreed
to buy and the Company agreed to sell 1,000,000 Units for consideration of $50,000. Each Unit issuable pursuant to the Agreement

Material
Changes in Results of Operations   

  Revenues
from continuing operations were $192,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and $100,000 for the fiscal year ended September
30, 2016. Net losses were$11,195,147 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and $7,750,594 for the same year ended 2016.  

The
decrease in Net Losses of 30.7 % is primarily attributable to  

(a)    $9,191,857
                                         of expenses recognized during the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 resulting from
                                         the issuance for less than fair value of equity in satisfactions of indebtedness as opposed
                                         to $4,748,408 of expenses recognized during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016
                                         resulting from the issuance for less than fair value of equity in satisfactions of indebtedness.    

(b)    $3,475
                                         of expenses recognized during the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 resulting from
                                         Preferred Shares issued pursuant to contractual obligations.    

  Offset
by increases in Research and Development Related expenses, General and Administrative Expenses, Consulting and Professional Fees
, Interest Expense and expenses related to amortization of Beneficial Conversion Features recognized as a result of the issuance
of Convertible Debt during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016 we had $24,822 cash on hand and current liabilities of $799,201 such liabilities consisting of Accounts
Payable, Notes Payable, Amounts Due to Shareholder and Accrued Expenses. We feel we will not be able to satisfy our cash requirements
over the next twelve months and shall be required to seek additional financing.  

The
Company plans to meet cash needs through applying for governmental and non-governmental grants as well as selling its securities
for cash. Management has yet to decide what type of offering the Company will use or how much capital the Company will raise.
There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through any type of offerings. Management can give no
assurance that any governmental or non-governmental grant will be obtained by the Company despite the Company s best efforts.
As of February 19, 2014 The Company has identified the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Clinical Trial Pilot Studies (R34)
grant which provides up to $450,000 in funding over a period of three years as well as the Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH for
Small Business Technology Transfer Grant Applications administered by the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program of
the National Institute of Health as grants for which the Company intends to apply.  

We
cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining additional financing necessary to implement our business plan. We have not
received any commitment or expression of interest from any financing source that has given us any assurance that we will obtain
the amount of additional financing in the future that we currently anticipate. For these and other reasons, we are not able to
assure that we will obtain any additional financing or, if we are successful, that we can obtain any such financing on terms that
may be reasonable in light of our current circumstances. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 the Company raised
$300,000 through the issuance of convertible debt and $1,254,751 through the issuance of equity securities.  

As
of December 13, 2016 we are not party to any binding agreements which would commit Regen to any material capital expenditures.

    REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    

   To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of   

   Regen
BioPharma, Inc.    

  We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Regen BioPharma, Inc. as of September 30, 2016 and the related statements of operations,
comprehensive income, stockholders  equity (deficit), and cash flows for the period ended September 30, 2016. Regen BioPharma,
Inc. s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.  

  We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

  In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regen
BioPharma, Inc. as of September 30, 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

  The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has negative working capital at September 30, 2016, has incurred recurring
losses and recurring negative cash flow from operating activities, and has an accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans concerning these matters are also described in Note
3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

   Notes
to Financial Statements   

   As
of September 30, 2016   

NOTE
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
Company was organized April 24, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is a controlled subsidiary of Bio-Matrix
Scientific Group, Inc, ( BMSN ) a Delaware corporation.  

The
Company intends to engage primarily in the development of regenerative medical applications which we intend to license from other
entities up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials after which we would either attempt
to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials  

A.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING  

The
financial statements have been prepared using the basis of accounting generally accepted in the United States of America. Under
this basis of accounting, revenues are recorded as earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. The
Company has adopted a September 30 year-end.  

B.
USE OF ESTIMATES  

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  

C.
CASH EQUIVALENTS  

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  

D.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs are expensed in the year in which they are incurred. Expenditures
that enhance the value of property and equipment are capitalized.  

E.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

Fair
value is the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal
or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  A fair value
hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels
of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:  

Level
1:  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  

Level
2:  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in
markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially
the full term of the related assets or liabilities.  

Level
3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of
the assets or liabilities.  

F.
INCOME TAXES  

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method prescribed by ASC 740,  Income Taxes.  Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The
Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates
is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The
Company applied the provisions of ASC 740-10-50,  Accounting For Uncertainty In Income Taxes , which provides clarification
related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods
remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute
of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company s liability for income taxes. Any such
adjustment could be material to the Company s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part,
upon the results of operations for the given period. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had no uncertain tax positions, and
will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future.  

The
Company generated a deferred tax credit through net operating loss carry forward.  However, a valuation allowance of 100%
has been established.  

Interest
and penalties on tax deficiencies recognized in accordance with ACS accounting standards are classified as income taxes in accordance
with ASC Topic 740-10-50-19.  

G.
 BASIC EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE  

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 260,  Earnings Per Share ,
which specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly
held common stock. ASC 260 requires the presentation of basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share.
The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 260 effective from inception.  

Basic
net loss per share amounts is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  

H.
ADVERTISING  

Costs
associated with advertising are charged to expense as incurred. Advertising expenses were $0 for the year ended September 30,
2016 and $0 for the year ended September 30, 2015.  

I.
REVENUE RECOGNITION  

Sales
of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery
has occurred; (iii) the price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. These terms are typically
met upon the prepayment or invoicing and shipment of products.  

  The
Company determines the amount and timing of royalty revenue based on its contractual agreements with intellectual property licensees.
The Company recognizes royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when the Company considers realization
of payment to be probable. Where royalties are based on a percentage of licensee sales of royalty-bearing products, the Company
recognizes royalty revenue by applying this percentage to the Company s estimate of applicable licensee sales. The Company
bases this estimate on an analysis of each licensee s sales results. Where warranted, revenue from licensees for contractual
obligations such as License Initiation Fees are recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions required to be satisfied in order
for that revenue to have been earned by the Company.  

NOTE
2.    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In
June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, which eliminated certain financial
reporting requirements of companies previously identified as  Development Stage Entities  (Topic 915). The amendments
in this ASU simplify accounting guidance by removing all incremental financial reporting requirements for development stage entities.
The amendments also reduce data maintenance and, for those entities subject to audit, audit costs by eliminating the requirement
for development stage entities to present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder
equity. Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the
entity s financial statements have not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other
entities). Upon adoption, entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by Topic 915. The Company has adopted
this standard.  

The
following accounting standards updates were recently issued and have not yet been adopted by us. These standards are currently
under review to determine their impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  

In
May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The revenue recognition
standard affects all entities that have contracts with customers, except for certain items. The new revenue recognition standard
eliminates the transaction-and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replaces it with a principle-based
approach for determining revenue recognition. Public entities are required to adopt the revenue recognition standard for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is not permitted
for public entities. The Company has reviewed the applicable ASU and has not, at the current time, quantified the effects of this
pronouncement, however it believes that there will be no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  

  In
June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-12 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting
for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service
Period. A performance target in a share-based payment that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service
period should be accounted for as a performance condition under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, Compensation  
Stock Compensation. As a result, the target is not reflected in the estimation of the award s grant date fair value. Compensation
cost would be recognized over the required service period, if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.
The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after 15 December 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company has reviewed the applicable ASU and has not, at the current time, quantified the effects
of this pronouncement, however it believes that there will be no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  

  In
August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15 Preparation of Financial Statements   Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP), continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing
financial statements unless and until the entity s liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under
this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entity s liquidation becomes
imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30,
Presentation of Financial Statements Liquidation Basis of Accounting. Even when an entity s liquidation is not imminent,
there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.
In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the
amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events.
The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim
periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU, however,
at the current period, management does not believe that it has met the conditions which would subject these financial statements
for additional disclosure.  

On
January 31, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-01, entitled Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about
Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. The guidance in ASU 2013-01 amends the requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
[FASB ASC] Topic 210, entitled Balance Sheet. The ASU 2013-01 amendments to FASB ASC 210 clarify that ordinary trade receivables
and receivables in general are not within the scope of ASU 2011-11, entitled Disclosure about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities,
where that ASU amended the guidance in FASB ASC 210. As those disclosures now are modified with the ASU 2013-01 amendments, the
FASB ASC 210 balance sheet offsetting disclosures now clearly are applicable only where reporting entities are involved with bifurcated
embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions
that either are offset using the FASB ASC 210 or 815 requirements, or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements
or similar agreements. ASU 2013-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim
periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.  

On
February 28, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-04, entitled Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several
Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date. The ASU 2013-04 amendments
add to the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC] Topic 405, entitled Liabilities and require reporting
entities to measure obligations resulting from certain joint and several liability arrangements where the total amount of the
obligation is fixed as of the reporting date, as the sum of the following:  

The
amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among co-obligors.  

Any
additional amounts the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors.  

While
early adoption of the amended guidance is permitted, for public companies, the guidance is required to be implemented in fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The amendments need to be implemented retrospectively
to all prior periods presented for obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that exist at the beginning
of the year of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2013-04 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s operating
results or financial position.  

On
April 22, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-07, entitled Liquidation Basis of Accounting. With ASU
2013-07, the FASB amends the guidance in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC] Topic 205, entitled Presentation
of Financial Statements. The amendments serve to clarify when and how reporting entities should apply the liquidation basis of
accounting. The guidance is applicable to all reporting entities, whether they are public or private companies or not-for-profit
entities. The guidance also provides principles for the recognition of assets and liabilities and disclosures, as well as related
financial statement presentation requirements. The requirements in ASU 2013-07 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2013, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods. Reporting entities are required to apply the
requirements in ASU 2013-07 prospectively from the day that liquidation becomes imminent. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption
of ASU 2013-07 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s operating results or financial position.  

  A
variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and
various regulatory agencies.  Due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, the Company s
management has not determined whether implementation of such standards would be material to its financial statements.  

NOTE
3. GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company generated
net losses of $ 20,224,319 during the period from April 24, 2012 (inception) through September 30, 2016. This condition raises
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going
concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately
to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Management
plans to raise additional funds by offering securities for cash. Management has yet to decide what type of offering the Company
will use or how much capital the Company will raise. During the year ended year ended September 30, 2016 the Company raised $1,254,751
through the issuance of equity securities for cash and $300,000 through the issuance of convertible debentures.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures   

a)
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  

The
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, they have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective
to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. David Koos is the Company s CEO and Todd Caven is the Company s CFO. They function
as the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively.  

b)
Management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting.  

Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 13a-15(f) defines internal control over financial
reporting as follows:  

The
term internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer's
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer's board
of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and includes those policies and procedures that:  

Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the issuer;  

Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and  

Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

The
Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s management
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures,
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only a reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure
controls and procedures are met.  

The
Company s management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2010 based
on the framework in  Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Guidance for Smaller Public Companies (2006) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its assessment, management believes that,
as of August 31, 2010, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective.  

Management's
report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's report in this annual report. This exemption for
smaller reporting companies provided under the temporary rules referenced above has been made permanent under Section 989G of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  

(c)
There have been no changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 in the Company s internal controls over financial
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

Code
of Ethics   

On
September 25, 2013 we adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.   

Director
Independence   

Audit
Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert  

The
members of the Company s board of Directors may not be considered independent. The Company is not a  listed company 
under Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and is therefore not required to have an audit committee comprised
of independent directors. The Company does not currently have an audit committee, however, for certain purposes of the rules and
regulations of the SEC and in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company s Board of Directors is deemed
to be its audit committee and as such functions as an audit committee and performs some of the same functions as an audit committee
including: (1) selection and oversight of our independent accountant; (2) establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and
treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal controls and auditing matters; and (3) engaging outside advisors. The Board
of Directors has determined that its member is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements and has substantial
business experience that results in that member's financial sophistication. Accordingly, the Board of Directors believes that
its member has the sufficient knowledge and experience necessary to fulfill the duties and obligations that an audit committee
would have.  

Nominating
and Compensation Committees  

The
Company does not have standing nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. The board of
directors believes that it is not necessary to have a compensation committee at this time because the functions of such committee
are adequately performed by the board of directors. The board of directors also is of the view that it is appropriate for the
Company not to have a standing nominating committee because the board of directors has performed and will perform adequately the
functions of a nominating committee. The Company is not a  listed company  under SEC rules and is therefore not required
to have a compensation committee or a nominating committee.  

Shareholder
Communications  

There
has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors.
There are no specific, minimum qualifications that the board of directors believes must be met by a candidate recommended by the
board of directors. Currently, the entire board of directors decides on nominees, on the recommendation of any member of the board
of directors followed by the board s review of the candidates  resumes and interview of candidates. Based on the information
gathered, the board of directors then makes a decision on whether to recommend the candidates as nominees for director. The Company
does not pay any fee to any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominee.  

Because
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Board of Directors
has determined not to adopt a formal methodology for communications from shareholders on the belief that any communication would
be brought to the Board of Directors  attention by virtue of the co-extensive capacities of the Chairman of the Board of
Directors.

promises to pay to the order of ________ ON DEMAND any time after September 20, 2017, the principal amount of Fifty Thousand Dollars
($50,000) and interest on the whole amount of said principal sum outstanding and remaining from time to time unpaid (the  Note ),
commencing from the date hereof and continuing until payment in full of this Note or conversion as hereinafter provided, at an
annual rate equal to ten percent (10%) simple interest. Interest shall be payable quarterly upon demand or upon conversion pursuant
to Section 2 hereunder. Interest shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365. Principal
and interest shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America, at the principal place of business of the Lender
or at such other place as the Lender may have designated from time to time in writing to the Company. 

2.  Conversion.  

2.1 Conversion
Right.  The Lender shall have the right from time to time to convert all or a part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount
of this Note into fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock, as such Common Stock and/or
Series A Preferred Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company into which
such Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the  Conversion
Price ) determined as provided herein (a  Conversion ). The Lender shall have the right to convert one hundred
percent (100%) of the Principal Amount immediately upon execution of this agreement and any accrued interest may be converted as
well. 

The number of shares
of Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing
the principal amount of this Note to be converted (the  Conversion Amount ) by the applicable Conversion Price as defined
in this Section 2 then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
 Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Company by the Lender on such conversion date (the  Conversion Date ).

Stock of the Company

amount of this Note is so converted. The Lender and the Company shall maintain records showing the principal amount so converted
and the dates of such conversions so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In the event
of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Company shall, prima facie, be controlling and determinative in the absence
of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as aforesaid, the Lender may not transfer
this Note unless the Lender first physically surrenders this Note to the Company, whereupon the Company will forthwith issue and
deliver upon the order of the Lender a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Lender (upon payment by the Lender of any applicable
transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note. 

Upon receipt by
the Company from the Lender of a facsimile transmission, e-mail, or other reasonable means of communication of a Notice of Conversion
meeting the requirements for conversion, the Company shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the
order of the Lender certificates for the Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon such conversion within five
(5) business days after such receipt. Upon receipt by the Company of a Notice of Conversion, the Lender shall be deemed to be the
Lender of record of the Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount
and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion. All rights with respect
to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock and/or Series

or at such other place as the Lender may have designated from time to time in writing to the Company. 

2.  Conversion.  

2.1 Conversion
Right.  The Lender shall have the right from time to time to convert all or a part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount
of this Note into fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock, as such Common Stock and/or
Series A Preferred Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company into which
such Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the  Conversion
Price ) determined as provided herein (a  Conversion ). The Lender shall have the right to convert one hundred
percent (100%) of the Principal Amount immediately upon execution of this agreement and any accrued interest may be converted as
well. 

The number of shares
of Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing
the principal amount of this Note to be converted (the  Conversion Amount ) by the applicable Conversion Price as defined
in this Section 2 then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
 Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Company by the Lender on such conversion date (the  Conversion Date ). 

2.2 Conversion
Price.  The  Conversion Price  shall be defined as $0.0125 per share for either the Common and/or the Series A Preferred
Stock of the Company 

2.3 Method of
Conversion.  Subject to Section 2.1, this Note may be converted by the Lender by submitting to the Company a Notice of Conversion
by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 5:00 p.m., New York,
New York time. The Lender shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless the entire unpaid principal
amount of this Note is so converted. The Lender and the Company shall maintain records showing the principal amount so converted
and the dates of such conversions so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In the event
of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Company shall, prima facie, be controlling and determinative in the absence
of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as aforesaid, the Lender may not transfer
this Note unless the Lender first physically surrenders this Note to the Company, whereupon the Company will forthwith issue and
deliver upon the order of the Lender a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Lender (upon payment by the Lender of any applicable
transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note. 

Upon receipt by
the Company from the Lender of a facsimile transmission, e-mail, or other reasonable means of communication of a Notice of Conversion
meeting the requirements for conversion, the Company shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the
order of the Lender certificates for the Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon such conversion within five
(5) business days after such receipt. Upon receipt by the Company of a Notice of Conversion, the Lender shall be deemed to be the
Lender of record of the Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount
and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion. All rights with respect
to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock and/or Series
A Preferred Stock or other securities as herein provided on such conversion. In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing
the Common Stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Company is participating in the Depository
Trust Company ( DTC ) Fast Automated Securities Transfer ( FAST ) program, upon request of the Lender,
the Company shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock and/or Series A
Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion to the Lender by crediting the account of Lender s Prime Broker with DTC through
its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system. 

2.4
Concerning the Shares.   The shares of Common Stock  and/or Series A Preferred Stock 
issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Act or (ii) the Company or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion
shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares
to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold

accordance with this Section 2.5 and who is an Accredited Investor as the term Accredited Investor is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation
D, promulgated under the Act.  

Subject
to the removal provisions set forth below, until such time as the shares of Common Stock  and/or Series A Preferred Stock 
issuable upon conversion of this Note have been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without
any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each certificate for
shares of issuable upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement or that has
not been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a
legend substantially in the following form, as appropriate:

legend if (i) the Company or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope customary
for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock  and/or
Series A Preferred Stock  may be made without registration under the Act and the shares are so sold
or transferred, (ii) such Lender provides the Company or its transfer agent with reasonable assurances that the Common Stock  and/or

for sale by under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or (iv) otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without
