 (Unaudited)     A. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Basis of Presentation     The condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Gordmans Stores, Inc. (the  Company ) and its subsidiaries, Gordmans Intermediate Holding Corp., Gordmans, Inc., Gordmans Management Company, Inc., Gordmans Distribution Company, Inc. and Gordmans LLC. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 30, 2016 was derived from the Company s audited
consolidated balance sheet as of that date. All other condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein are unaudited and reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to summarize fairly our financial
position and results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. All of these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.      Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies     The accounting policies followed by the Company are reflected in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016, included in our fiscal year 2015
Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year
ended January 30, 2016. Due to the seasonality of our business, the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year. In addition, quarterly results of operations can vary
based upon the timing and amount of net sales and costs associated with the opening of new stores.      Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
    In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-04,  Extinguishments of Liabilities , to provide specific guidance for the derecognition of
prepaid store-valued product liabilities. ASU 2016-04 is effective retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of
the adoption of ASU 2016-04 on the consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock
Compensation , to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
ASU 2016-09 will now require all excess tax benefits and tax shortfalls to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The Company recorded excess tax shortfalls of $0.2 in additional paid-in-capital during the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 and $0.3 million in both fiscal years 2015 and 2014. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016.  
   Adoption of New Accounting Principle     During the three months ended April 30, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability and is effective
retrospectively for all years reported. The following table summarizes the effects of this new guidance on amounts previously reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at the periods ended:

   B. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS   
 Gordmans Stores, Inc. operated 106 everyday value price department stores under the trade name  Gordmans  located in 22 states as of October 29,
2016. Gordmans offers a wide merchandise assortment including apparel and footwear for men, women and children, accessories, fragrances and home fashions for up to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day in a fun,
easy-to-shop environment. We also operate an eCommerce site which provides a broad selection of merchandise in a convenient, user-friendly digital platform.  
 The Company defines an operating segment on the same basis that it uses to evaluate performance internally. The Company has determined that its Chief
Executive Officer is the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Company has one reportable segment. The Company opened five new stores and closed one existing store during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 and opened six new stores and
closed one existing store during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015.    The following table reflects the percentage of revenues by major
merchandising category:      
    C. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   
 Property and equipment consist of the following:      
    D. DEBT OBLIGATIONS   
   Revolving Line of Credit Facility     Gordmans, Inc. (the  Borrower ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has a $100.0
million revolving line of credit facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ), as arranger and administrative agent for the lenders. On September 2, 2016, Gordmans, Inc. entered into the Ninth Amendment
to Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement (the  Ninth Amendment ) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The amendment increases the borrowing availability under its revolving line of credit facility from $80.0 million to $100.0
million. In connection with the revolving line of credit facility increase, the Company s borrowing base term loan reserve calculation now includes a minimum term loan reserve of $5.0 million. The Company s requirement to maintain minimum
excess availability under the revolving line of credit facility of at least $20.0 million, which includes up to $3.0 million of unrestricted cash, remains unchanged.  
 The agreement expires June 28, 2020, at which time all outstanding indebtedness under the agreement becomes due and payable.  
 The Joinder and Eighth Amendment to Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement dated June 29, 2015 established a $30.0 million secured term loan facility
provided by Wells Fargo, Pathlight Capital LLC and Gordon Brothers Finance Company, as discussed below. The amendment extended the maturity date of the revolving line of credit facility from August 27, 2018 to June 28, 2020. The amendment
also eliminated the seasonal borrowing periods during which periods the applicable interest rate increased by 75 basis points and advance rates under the borrowing base were increased by 5.0%, amended the minimum excess availability covenant, and
amended certain negative and affirmative covenant requirements.

  Borrowings under this facility bear interest at various rates, with two rate options at the discretion of
management as follows: (1) for base rate advances, borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus 1.00% when average excess availability is less than or equal to $40.0 million and the prime rate plus 0.75% when average excess availability is
greater than $40.0 million, and (2) for LIBOR rate advances, borrowings bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.00% when average excess availability is less than or equal to $40.0 million and the LIBOR rate plus 1.75% when average excess
availability is greater than $40.0 million. The Company is required to maintain minimum excess availability under the revolving line of credit facility of at least $20.0 million, the calculation which includes up to $3.0 million of unrestricted
cash. Excess availability under our revolving line of credit facility was $36.1 million at October 29, 2016 compared to $59.3 million at January 30, 2016 and $40.6 million at October 31, 2015. The Company had $33.1 million, $56.3
million and $37.6 million available to borrow at October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. Borrowings under this facility totaling $5.0 million bore interest at a rate of 4.25% under the base rate option
and $53.0 million bore interest at rates between 2.28% and 2.29% under the LIBOR option at October 29, 2016. Borrowings under this facility bore interest at a rate of 4.25% and 4.00% under the base rate option at January 30, 2016 and
October 31, 2015, respectively. The Company had outstanding letters of credit included in the borrowing base totaling approximately $9.0 million, $6.7 million and $6.5 million as of October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016 and
October 31, 2015, respectively.    Borrowings are secured by the Company s inventory, accounts receivable and all other personal property, except
as specifically excluded in the agreement. The revolving line of credit facility has a first lien on all collateral other than term loan priority collateral and a second lien on the term loan priority collateral.  
   Term Loan Facility     The Borrower entered into a $45.0 million senior term loan on August 27, 2013, as amended November 14, 2014,
with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC ( Cerberus ) to partially fund the $69.9 million special cash dividend declared in August 2013. This senior term loan with Cerberus was extinguished in full on June 29, 2015 with the proceeds from a
new $30.0 million secured term loan facility established by the June 29, 2015 amendment discussed above.    The new secured term loan facility matures
on the same date as the revolving line of credit facility and has principal payments of $0.4 million due on a quarterly basis beginning in October 2015 through the maturity date, with the remaining principal due on the maturity date of June 28,
2020. The Company may repay at any time all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the new secured term loan facility, subject to a prepayment premium equal to 3.0% in the first year, 1.5% in the second year, 0.5% in the third year and
0.0% thereafter. The term loan facility carries an interest rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus 6.25% with a floor of 1.0%. The interest rate on the new secured term loan facility was 7.25% at October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016 and
October 31, 2015. The secured term loan facility includes a borrowing base in addition to the revolving loan borrowing base. The secured term loan facility is secured by the same collateral as the revolving line of credit facility but has a
priority lien on real estate, fixtures, equipment, intellectual property and books, records, permits, licenses, insurance and proceeds thereof and a second lien on the revolving priority collateral, as defined in the June 29, 2015 amendment.
   The Cerberus senior term loan had a maturity date of August 27, 2018, with payments of $0.3 million due on a quarterly basis from October 2014
through October 2015. In connection with the extinguishment of the Cerberus senior term loan, the Company wrote off deferred financing fees of $1.7 million and paid a prepayment penalty of $0.3 million. These expenses are recorded as loss on
extinguishment of debt in the condensed consolidated statement of operations during the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.    Among other provisions, the
Company s debt agreement with Wells Fargo contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a negative covenant that restricts the level and form of indebtedness entered into by the Company or its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Exceptions to this covenant include borrowings under our $30.0 million senior term loan and, subject to certain conditions, indebtedness with all acquisitions not to exceed $10.0 million in the aggregate. The revolving line of credit facility also
includes a negative covenant that restricts dividends and other upstream distributions by the Company and its subsidiaries to the extent the Company does not meet minimum excess availability thresholds. Exceptions to this covenant include dividends
or other upstream distributions: (i) by subsidiaries of Gordmans, Inc. to Gordmans, Inc. and its other subsidiaries, (ii) that consist of repurchases of stock of employees in an amount not to exceed $0.5 million in any fiscal year,
(iii) that consist of the payment of taxes on behalf of any employee, officer or director of the Company for vested restricted stock of the Company owned by such employee, officer or director, (iv) to the Company to pay federal, state and
local income taxes and franchise taxes solely arising out of the consolidated operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, (v) to the Company to pay certain reasonable directors  fees and out-of-pocket expenses, reasonable and customary
indemnities to directors, officers and employees and other expenses in connection with ordinary corporate governance, overhead, legal and accounting and maintenance and (vi) dividends so long as no event of default exists, projected excess
availability for the next twelve months is greater than $35.0 million and 30% of the loan cap and the fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than 1.0 to 1.0 on a historical and projected basis. The agreement also includes a negative covenant that
restricts subsidiaries of the Company from making any loans to the Company. Should the Company default on scheduled repayment of the secured term loan facility, Wells Fargo may make any outstanding obligations under the agreement immediately due and
payable. As of October 29, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

    Long-term Debt     Long-term debt consists of the following:  
   
   At October 29, 2016, annual maturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years were as follows:  
   
   The Company had $58.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit facility as of October 29,
2016, which is included in the current portion of long-term debt as the Company intends to repay the outstanding borrowings with available cash flows from operations. The revolving line of credit facility matures in June 2020. As the Company is in
compliance with all debt covenants, there are currently no requirements to pay down the facility until its maturity date. The Company had $17.0 million and $35.9 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit facility as of
January 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. Average borrowings during the thirty-nine week periods ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, were $31.7 million and $19.5 million, respectively.  
   Financial Instruments     Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and the variable
interest rate of the term loan, the fair value of the term loan approximates its carrying amount of at October 29, 2016. Fair value approximates the carrying value of the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit facility due to both
the short-term nature of these borrowings and the variable interest rates of this agreement. For all other financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts
approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.     E. LEASES   
 The Company has entered into short and long term operating lease agreements. These leases relate to retail store locations, the distribution centers and the
corporate headquarters. The leases expire on various dates through the year 2029 with most of the leases containing renewal options. Leases for retail store locations typically have base lease terms of 10 years, generally with one or more five year
renewal periods. Certain retail store leases contain provisions for additional rent based on varying percentages of net sales. Leases for the distribution centers and corporate headquarters have base lease terms of 15 to 20 years with multiple
renewal periods. In fiscal 2014, the Company entered into capital lease arrangements for computer hardware and related software with a lease term of 5 years.

  Future minimum lease payments, by year, under operating leases and future obligations under non-cancelable
leases, by year, as of October 29, 2016 are as follows:      
    F. SHARE BASED COMPENSATION   
 The Gordmans Stores, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2010 Plan ) provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, dividend equivalents and other share-based awards. Directors, officers and other associates of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as others performing consulting or advisory
services, are eligible for grants under the 2010 Plan. As of October 29, 2016, an aggregate of 4,573,086 shares of the Company s common stock were reserved under the 2010 Plan, subject to adjustments for stock splits and other actions
affecting the Company s common stock.    There were 1,165,005 shares of common stock available for future grants under the 2010 Plan as of
October 29, 2016.      Restricted Stock     A summary of restricted stock activity during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29,
2016 is set forth in the table below:      
   Restricted stock vests at varying rates of 20% per year over five years, 25% per year over four years or 33  1 / 3 % per year over three years, as applicable. Unrecognized compensation expense on the restricted stock was $0.7 million at
October 29, 2016, which is expected to be recognized over a period of 1.6 years.      Performance Shares     The Board of Directors
granted performance shares in fiscal year 2015 to be awarded in the form of common stock to officers and other associates of the Company if certain market condition criteria are achieved. The performance shares vest at the end of fiscal year 2017 if
certain criteria are achieved provided the participant is then employed by the Company. Vesting of these potentially issuable shares are dependent upon the Company s total shareholder return for the three-year measurement period compared to a
pre-determined group of retail peer competitors. If the Company s total shareholder return is at the high end of the pre-determined group of retail peer competitors, the maximum amount of shares to be issued pursuant to this award is 200% of
the performance shares which are non-vested as of October 29, 2016. The actual number of performance shares that will ultimately vest is based on the actual percentile ranking of the Company s total shareholder return compared to the peer
performance at the end of fiscal year 2017.    On June 7, 2016, the Board of Directors granted 108,800 performance shares to be awarded in the form of
common stock to officers and other associates of the Company if certain market condition criteria is achieved. If the Company s total shareholder return is at the high end of the pre-determined retail peer competitor index, the maximum amount
of shares available to be issued pursuant to this  
      11  

Table of Contents  

award is 200% of the performance shares approved on June 7, 2016 and are non-vested at October 29, 2016. The actual number of performance shares that will ultimately vest is based on
the actual percentile ranking of the Company s total shareholder return compared to the peer performance at the end of fiscal year 2018.    The Company
used the Monte Carlo valuation model to estimate the fair value of the performance shares on the date of the grant. The weighted average assumptions used by the Company in applying the Monte Carlo valuation model for option grants during the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 are illustrated in the following table:      
   The Monte Carlo valuation assumed 109.3% and 159.9% of the performance shares granted in fiscal years 2016 and 2015,
respectively, would be awarded at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 based upon the Company s estimated total shareholder return relative to peer performance. Unrecognized compensation expense on the performance shares was $0.5 million at
October 29, 2016, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.    A summary of performance share activity during the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 is set forth in the table below:      
     Stock Options   - A summary of stock option activity during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 is
set forth in the table below:      

(1) 
 The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options is the difference between the current market value of the Company s stock as of October 29, 2016 and the option strike price. The stock price at October 29,

was $1.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.    Share-based compensation expense was $0.2 million and
$0.4 million for the thirteen week periods ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. For the thirty-nine week periods ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, share-based compensation expense was $0.5 million
and $1.0 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense was lower for the thirty-nine week period ended October 29, 2016 due to forfeitures.

Statements of this Quarterly Report.      Executive Overview   
 Gordmans is an everyday value price department store featuring a large selection of brands, fashions and styles at up to 60% off department and specialty store
prices every day in a fun, easy-to-shop environment. Our merchandise assortment includes apparel and footwear for men, women and children, accessories (including fragrances) and home fashions. The origins of Gordmans date back to 1915, and as of
October 29, 2016, we operated 106 stores in 22 states situated in a variety of shopping center developments, including lifestyle centers, power centers and enclosed regional shopping malls. We also operate an eCommerce site which provides a
broad selection of merchandise in a convenient, user-friendly digital platform.    We opened five new stores and closed one existing store during the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016. This compares to opening six new stores and closing one existing store during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015.  
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. These key measures include net sales and comparable
store sales and other individual store performance factors, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses.      Net
Sales   .  Net sales reflect our revenues from the sale of our merchandise less returns and discounts, eCommerce shipping revenue and excludes sales tax. Net sales include comparable store sales and non-comparable store sales.  
   Comparable Store Sales   .  Comparable store sales include retail stores that were open at least 16 months as of the end of the reporting
period and eCommerce sales. Comparable store sales include stores that were relocated or remodeled and exclude stores that were closed. Comparable store sales are assessed on both an owned and licensed basis, which includes the impact to growth in
comparable sales of departments where we own the inventory or departments which are licensed to a third party. We also review the average sale per transaction, comparable store transactions and store traffic. Comparable store sales are an important
indicator of current operating performance, with higher comparable store sales helping us to leverage our fixed expenses and positively impacting our operating results.  
   Gross Profit   .  Gross profit is equal to our net sales minus cost of sales, plus license fee income generated from sales of footwear and
maternity apparel in our leased departments. The license agreement related to our maternity business expired in March 2016 and was not renewed. Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, inbound freight to our distribution
centers, inventory shrinkage and inventory write-downs. Gross profit margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our net sales. Our gross profit may not be comparable to other retailers, as some companies include all of the costs related to
their distribution network in cost of sales while others, like us, exclude a portion of these costs from cost of sales and include those costs in selling, general and administrative expenses. Our gross profit margin is a function of initial markup
less shrink and markdowns, with higher initial markup and lower markdowns positively impacting our operating results.      Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses   .  Selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs not included in cost of sales. These expenses include payroll and other expenses related to operations at our corporate office, store
and eCommerce expenses, occupancy costs, certain distribution and warehousing costs, pre-opening and closing expenses, depreciation and amortization and advertising expenses. Our ability to manage store level and certain other operating expenses
directly impacts our operating results.      Overview    
 The net loss for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 was $4.8 million and $12.5 million, respectively, as compared to a net loss of
$2.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively, for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. Below is a summary of our financial results for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016.  

Net sales decreased 6.7% and 5.7%, respectively, for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29,
2016 as compared to the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. Lower net sales were driven by a decrease in comparable store sales impacted by lower traffic during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29 2016,
partially offset by an increase in non-comparable stores and an increase in the average sale per transaction during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016. Comparable store sales on an owned basis decreased 9.5% and
    
      15

8.5%, respectively, for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 as compared to an increase of 0.8% and a decrease of 0.8%, respectively, for the thirteen and thirty-nine
weeks ended October 31, 2015. On an owned and licensed basis, comparable store sales declined 9.3% and 8.3%, respectively, for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 as compared an increase of 0.3% and a decrease of
0.8%, respectively, for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015.         

Gross profit margin decreased 60 basis points during the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 and 70 basis points during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016, as compared to the thirteen weeks and
thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015, primarily as a result of higher merchandise inventory markdowns.        

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 200 basis points to 48.7% of net sales for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to 46.7% of net sales for the thirteen weeks ended
October 31, 2015 and increased 250 basis points to 47.6% of net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to 45.1% of net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. The decrease in selling,
general and administrative expenses for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 was primarily due to lower advertising and store expenses, partially offset by higher professional fees related to the comprehensive expense
review, eCommerce operations which were launched during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and higher depreciation.       Basis of Presentation
and Results of Operations     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Gordmans Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries, Gordmans
Intermediate Holding Corp., Gordmans, Inc., Gordmans Management Company, Inc., Gordmans Distribution Company, Inc. and Gordmans LLC. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We utilize a typical retail 52-53
week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Fiscal years 2016 and 2015 represent fifty-two week years ending January 28, 2017 and ended January 30, 2016, respectively. All references to fiscal
years are to the calendar year in which the fiscal year begins. The thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 represent the third quarters of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The thirty-nine weeks ended
October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 represent the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.    The table below sets

 Percentages may not foot due to rounding.       Thirteen Weeks Ended October 29, 2016 Compared to Thirteen
Weeks Ended October 31, 2015       Net Sales    
 Net sales for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased $10.4 million, or 6.7%, to $143.5 million as compared to $153.9 million
for the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in comparable store sales due to lower guest traffic partially offset by an increase in non-comparable store sales due to the opening of
four net new stores in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016. Owned comparable store sales decreased $13.9 million, or 9.5%, while owned and licensed comparable store sales decreased 9.3% during the thirteen weeks ended October 29,
2016. The comparable store sales decrease was primarily due to a low-double digit decrease in comparable transactions resulting from a decrease in guest traffic, partially offset by a low-single digit increase in the average sale per transaction.
From a major merchandising category perspective, Accessories (including fragrances) and Apparel generated low-double digit comparable store sales decreases, while Home Fashions experienced a mid-single digit comparable store sales decrease for the
thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2015.      License Fees from Leased Departments
     License fee income related to sales of merchandise in leased departments was $1.9 million, or 1.4% of net sales, for the thirteen weeks ended
October 29, 2016 and $2.2 million, or 1.4% of net sales, for the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in maternity license fees as our license agreement related to our maternity business
expired in March 2016 and was not renewed.      Gross Profit    
 Gross profit, which includes license fees from leased departments, for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased $5.5 million, or 8.0%, to
$62.9 million as compared to $68.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2015. Gross profit margin decreased 60 basis points to 43.8% of net sales as compared to 44.4% of net sales for the thirteen weeks ended
October 31, 2015. The 60 basis point decrease in gross profit was due primarily to higher merchandise inventory markdowns.      Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses      Selling, general and administrative expenses during the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased $2.0
million, or 2.8%, to $69.9 million as compared to $71.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 48.7% for the thirteen weeks ended October 29,
2016 compared to 46.7% for the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2015, a 200 basis point increase.

  Advertising expenses decreased $1.5 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 as compared to
the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2015 due primarily to a decrease in television advertising, direct mail and preprint expenses.    Store expenses
decreased $1.2 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 as compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2015 primarily due to in-store merchandise credit breakage recorded during the third quarter fiscal 2016. Breakage
for in-store merchandise credit is recognized as revenue when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote which has been determined to be three years from the date of issuance. Store expenses also decreased due to lower store payroll in existing
stores as a result of our comprehensive expense review, partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with new store openings and the launch of eCommerce operations in mid-2015. Store expenses were 120 basis points higher in the third
quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, primarily due to the deleveraging of store costs associated with the decrease in comparable store sales and the launch of eCommerce operations in mid-2015, partially offset by
in-store merchandise credit breakage.    Distribution center expenses decreased $0.5 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 primarily
due to lower delivery costs as a result of lower inventory receipts during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, partially offset by higher capitalized freight.  
 Pre-opening and closing expenses decreased $0.1 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 due to the opening of three new stores in the
third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the opening of two new stores and closing one existing store during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $0.4 million, or 50 basis points as a percentage of net sales, during the thirteen weeks ended
October 29, 2016 as compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2015 due to increased investment in technology, including the launch of eCommerce operations in mid-2015 and new store openings.  
 Corporate expenses increased $0.9 million, or 110 basis points, during the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 as compared to the thirteen weeks ended
October 31, 2015, primarily due to higher professional service fees related to our engagement of an outside party to assist in identifying expense savings opportunities, partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense due
primarily to forfeitures.      Interest Expense, Net    
 Interest expense, net for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 was $0.9 million.  
   Loss before Taxes      The loss before taxes for the
thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 was $7.9 million compared to the loss before taxes of $4.5 million in the thirteen weeks ended October 31, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, the loss before taxes was 5.5% for the third quarter of
fiscal 2016 compared to the loss before taxes of 2.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015.      Income Tax Benefit    
 The income tax benefit for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 was $3.1 million compared to $1.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended
October 31, 2015. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 of 39.0% compared to the effective tax rate of 38.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The effective rate differed from the federal enacted rate of 35%
primarily due to federal tax credits and state taxes, net of federal benefits.    We have considered the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected operating results as well as projected taxable income and have concluded that it is more likely than not that existing gross deferred tax assets will be realized. If our financial performance does not improve or deteriorates, the reversals
of deferred tax liabilities may not be sufficient to offset current operating losses and an additional or a full valuation allowance may become necessary. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our deferred tax assets and related
valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.      Net Loss    
 The net loss for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 was $4.8 million compared to a net loss of $2.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended
October 31, 2015.

weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased $25.4 million, or 5.7%, to $417.8 million as compared to $443.2 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in
comparable store sales due to lower guest traffic partially offset by an increase in non-comparable store sales due to the opening of four net new stores in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016. Owned comparable store sales
decreased $36.5 million, or 8.5%, while owned and licensed comparable store sales decreased 8.3% during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016. The comparable store sales decrease was primarily due to a low-double digit decrease in
comparable transactions resulting from a decrease in guest traffic, partially offset by a low-single digit increase in the average sale per transaction. From a major merchandising category perspective, Apparel and Accessories (including fragrances)
generated high-single digit comparable store sales decreases, while Home Fashions experienced a mid-single digit comparable store sales decrease for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended
October 31, 2015.      License Fees from Leased Departments    
 License fee income related to sales of merchandise in leased departments for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased $0.7 million, or
10.2%, to $5.9 million compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015, primarily due to the decrease in maternity license fees as our license agreement related to our maternity business expired in March 2016 and was not renewed.  
   Gross Profit      Gross profit, which includes license
fees from leased departments, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased $14.2 million, or 7.2%, to $181.9 million as compared to $196.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. Gross profit
margin decreased 70 basis points to 43.6% of net sales as compared to 44.3% of net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. The 70 basis point decrease was primarily due higher merchandise inventory markdowns.

45.1% during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015, a 250 basis point increase.    Distribution center expenses decreased $1.4 million in the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 primarily due to lower delivery, processing and payroll costs as a result of lower inventory receipts during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015,
partially offset by lower capitalized freight.    Store expenses decreased $1.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 as compared to
the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 primarily due to in-store merchandise credit breakage recorded during the third quarter fiscal 2016. Breakage for in-store merchandise credit is recognized as revenue when the likelihood of
redemption becomes remote which has been determined to be three years from the date of issuance. Store expense also decreased due to lower store payroll in existing stores as a result of our comprehensive expense review, partially offset by an
increase in expenses associated with new store openings and the launch of eCommerce operations in mid-2015. Store expenses were 140 basis points higher in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015
primarily due to the deleveraging of store costs associated with the comparable store sales decline and the launch of eCommerce operations in mid-2015.  
 Advertising expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 10 basis points, during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 as compared to the thirty-nine weeks

of net sales, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 due to increased investment in technology, including the launch of eCommerce operations in mid-2015 and new store

  Corporate expenses increased $2.2 million, or 90 basis points, during the thirty-nine weeks ended
October 29, 2016 as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015, primarily due to higher professional service fees related to our engagement of an outside party to assist in identifying expense savings opportunities, partially
offset by lower share-based compensation expense due primarily to forfeitures.      Interest Expense    
 Interest expense, net for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased $0.4 million to $2.5 million compared to $3.0 million for the thirty-nine
weeks ended October 31, 2015 due primarily to a 225 basis point reduction in the interest rate on the refinanced term loan during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, partially offset by higher borrowings on the revolving line of credit facility.
     Loss on Extinguishment of Debt      The loss on
extinguishment of debt for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 of $2.0 million was the result of extinguishing in full the senior term loan with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC. The loss on extinguishment of debt includes the write off
of deferred financing fees of $1.7 million related to the extinguished senior term loan during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as a $0.3 million penalty on the early extinguishment of the term loan.  
   Loss before Taxes      The loss before taxes for the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 increased to $19.6 million compared to the loss before taxes of $8.9 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, the loss before taxes was 4.7% of net
sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to the loss before taxes of 2.0% of net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015.  
   Income Tax Benefit      The income tax benefit for the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 was $7.1 million and included a partial valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $0.5 million of expense related to certain long term leases, which was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal
2016. The income tax benefit was $3.5 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. The effective tax rate for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 of 36.2% compared to the effective tax rate of 39.0% for the first
three quarters of fiscal 2015. The effective rate differed from the federal enacted rate of 35% primarily due to federal tax credits and state taxes, net of federal benefits, and the partial valuation allowance recorded in the second quarter of
fiscal 2016.    We have considered the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected operating results as well as projected taxable income and have
concluded that it is more likely than not that existing gross deferred tax assets will be realized. If our financial performance does not improve or deteriorates, the reversals of deferred tax liabilities may not be sufficient to offset current
operating losses and additional or a full valuation allowance may become necessary. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.  
   Net Loss      The net loss for the thirty-nine weeks
ended October 29, 2016 was $12.5 million compared to $5.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, the net loss was 3.0% of net sales for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared
to the net loss of 1.2% of net sales for the first three quarters of fiscal 2015.     Seasonality   
 Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which are typical of retailers that carry a similar merchandise offering. A disproportionate amount of our
sales and net income are historically realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. In fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, 31.7%, 32.1%, and 32.3% of our net sales were generated in the fourth
quarter. Our business is also subject, at certain times, to calendar shifts, which may occur during key selling periods close to holidays such as Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas and regional fluctuations for events such as sales tax holidays.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for operating expenses, inventory, store and distribution center capital improvements, investments in our information
technology, including our eCommerce operations which were launched in mid-2015 and the point-of-sale system completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, capital expenditures for existing store improvements and investments in our distribution
centers, as well as debt service. Our typical investment in a new store is approximately $1.2 million, which represents pre-opening expenses of $0.3 million and inventory of $0.9 million (of which $0.3 million is typically financed through trade
payables). The fixed assets and leasehold improvements associated with a new store opening, excluding structural costs, of approximately $1.2 million have typically been financed by landlords through favorable tenant improvement allowances. There
are no new store openings scheduled for fiscal 2017. Our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash from operations, borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility and tenant improvement allowances.  
 We have experienced losses of $12.5 million during the thirty-nine week period ending October 29, 2016 and $4.3 million and $3.5 million during fiscal
years ended January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively. Additionally, during the thirty-nine week period ended October 29, 2016, and the fiscal years ended January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, we had net cash
provided by (used in) operating activities of $(24.9) million, $8.6 million and $45.2 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities are typically the lowest during the third quarter which includes higher inventory levels in preparation
for the holiday selling period. We have generated positive operating cash flows in each of the years ended January 30, 2016, January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014. Since the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we have relied on bank
borrowings for our capital needs to fund the Company s operations. If financial performance does not improve we will be required to rely more heavily on bank borrowings.  
 Our working capital at October 29, 2016 was $0.7 million compared to working capital of $22.2 million at January 30, 2016 and $17.7 million at
October 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital from January 30, 2016 to October 29, 2016 primarily relates to higher borrowings on our line of credit facility due to the timing of capital expenditures and higher seasonal
merchandise inventories and accounts payables during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal year end 2015 and 2014.    Total long-term debt,
net of debt issue costs increased from $45.7 million at January 30, 2016 to $85.5 million at October 29, 2016 primarily due to higher borrowings on our line of credit facility at October 29, 2016. On September 2, 2016, the
Borrower entered into the Ninth Amendment (the  Ninth Amendment ) to Loan, Guaranty and Security agreement with Wells Fargo. The Ninth Amendment increases the maximum revolving loan commitment under its revolving credit facility from $80.0
million to $100.0 million. In connection with the revolving line of credit facility increase, the Company s borrowing base term loan reserve calculation now includes a minimum term loan reserve of $5.0 million. The majority of the secured term
loan principal is due on the maturity date of June 28, 2020, with quarterly principal payments of $0.4 million through the maturity date. We intend to pay down the revolving line of credit facility with available cash flows from operations. The
revolving line of credit facility matures in June 2020. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of October 29, 2016, as such there are currently no requirements to pay down the facility until its maturity date.  
 The Company paid a prepayment premium of $0.3 million related to the Cerberus senior term loan early extinguishment during the second quarter of fiscal 2015,
which was equal to 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance at the time of the payoff of the Cerberus senior term loan.    There were $58.0 million of
borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit facility at October 29, 2016, as compared to $17.0 million at January 30, 2016 and $35.9 million at October 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents were $8.4 million, $7.0 million
and $8.9 million at October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $24.9 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to net cash used
in operating activities of $11.8 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. Average borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility increased to $31.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 from
$19.5 million in thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. The largest amount borrowed at one time during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 was $58.0 million compared to $35.9 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended
October 31, 2015. Excess availability under our revolving line of credit facility, which includes up to $3.0 million of unrestricted cash, was $36.1 million at October 29, 2016 compared to $59.3 million at January 30, 2016 and $40.6
million at October 31, 2015. Stockholders  equity was $22.7 million as of October 29, 2016 compared to $34.9 million as of January 30, 2016 and $34.1 million as of October 31, 2015.  
 During the course of our seasonal business cycle, working capital is needed to support inventory for existing stores, particularly during peak selling
seasons. Historically, our working capital needs are lowest in the first quarter and peak late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the holiday selling season. Management believes that the net cash provided by
operating activities, bank borrowings, vendor trade terms, factor credit availability, tenant improvement allowances and the use of operating leases for new stores will be sufficient to fund anticipated current and long-term capital expenditures and
working capital requirements.  
      21  

Table of Contents  

  Our ability to have sufficient liquidity in future periods in order to continue meeting all of our payment
obligations, including those under our loan agreement, will depend on generating positive operating cash flow, primarily through improvement in comparable store sales, operating with lower comparable store inventory levels, improved gross profit and
controlling and reducing our expenses, which in turn, may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. See  Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors.   
   Capital Expenditures      Net capital expenditures
during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 were $13.1 million and $10.7 million, respectively. The increase in net capital expenditures during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 is primarily
related to the timing of new store capital expenditures and increased investment in technology including the new point of sales system.    We lease all of
our store locations. In certain cases, we negotiate leases whereby we take responsibility for construction of a new store during the construction period and are reimbursed for our costs from the landlord. When this situation occurs, we report the
construction costs as part of our capital expenditures and, as reimbursements for structural assets, such as the building shell, are received from the landlord for construction costs where we are the accounting owner during the construction period,
we report the proceeds received from the landlord as proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions.      Cash Flow Analysis    
 A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities are shown in the following table (in thousands):  
   
     Cash Flows from Operating Activities    
 Net cash used in operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 was $24.9 million, which included a net loss of $12.5 million and
noncash charges of $6.5 million comprised of depreciation and amortization expense of $13.5 million, deferred tax valuation allowance of $0.5 million, share-based compensation expense of $0.5 million, a loss on property disposals and impairment
charges of $0.4 million and amortization of deferred financing fees of $0.2 million, offset by the deferred tax asset shortfall related to share-based compensation of $0.2 million and changes in deferred income taxes of $8.5 million. Net cash used
in operating activities in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 was favorably impacted by an increase in accounts payable of $28.3 million due higher merchandise inventory receipts attributable to the seasonal inventory build for the
holiday season compared to fiscal year end 2015, a $2.3 million decrease in accounts, landlord and income taxes receivable due to the collection of the fiscal year 2015 federal tax refund and a decrease in other assets of $0.1 million. The increases
in operating cash flows for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 were partially offset by a $47.0 million increase in merchandise inventories primarily related to higher seasonal inventory levels for the holiday selling season, a
decrease in deferred rent primarily related to new stores of $1.3 million, an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $0.8 million primarily related to new store growth and prepaid advertising and a $0.3 million decrease in accrued expenses
and other liabilities.    Net cash used in operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 was $11.8 million, which included a
net loss of $5.4 million and noncash charges of $16.9 million comprised of depreciation and amortization expense of $12.4 million, write-off of deferred financing fees of $1.7 million, share-based compensation expense of $1.0 million, loss on
retirement of property and equipment of $0.7 million, changes in deferred income taxes of $0.7 million, amortization of deferred financing fees of $0.4 million and $26 thousand of expense associated with the deferred tax asset shortfall related to
share-based compensation. Net cash used in operating activities in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 was favorably impacted by an increase in accounts payable of  
      22  

Table of Contents  

$46.9 million related to higher merchandise inventory receipts attributable to seasonality, new store growth and higher average comparable store inventory levels partially offset by the timing of
payments associated with earlier fall merchandise inventory receipts as well as a decrease in accounts, landlord and income taxes receivable of $3.8 million, a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $1.5 million, and a decrease in
other assets of $0.2 million. The increases in operating cash flows for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 were partially offset by a $70.6 million increase in merchandise inventories primarily related to higher average comparable
store inventory levels and earlier merchandise inventory receipts, the six new stores that opened during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 and the launch of e-commerce at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating cash flows were
also reduced by a decrease in deferred rent primarily related to new stores of $4.2 million, an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $0.8 million primarily due to the timing of insurance renewals and new store growth.  
   Cash Flows from Investing Activities      Net cash
used in investing activities in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 was $13.2 million and $10.7 million, respectively. Cash of $22.8 million and $14.3 million was used for purchases of property and equipment
during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. This increase in purchases of property and equipment during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 is primarily due to timing differences in
new store capital expenditures impacted by sale-leaseback accounting as well as increased investment in the new point-of-sale system.    Proceeds from
sale-leaseback transactions were $9.6 million and $3.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively, where the Company was deemed the accounting owner of the structural property additions
during the new store construction period pursuant to the underlying lease agreement. This $6.0 million increase in cash generated from proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions primarily resulted from the timing of receipt of payments from
landlords.      Cash Flows from Financing Activities    
 Net cash provided by financing activities was $39.5 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016, as compared to net cash provided by
financing activities of $23.7 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. Borrowings and repayments on our revolving line of credit facility were $179.5 million and $138.6 million, respectively, during the thirty-nine weeks
ended October 29, 2016, compared to $169.4 million and $144.5 million, respectively, during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. Cash of $1.4 million was also used during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 for
payments on our secured term loan and on capital lease obligations compared to cash of $30.0 million used during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 for payment of long term debt including the Cerberus senior term loan payoff. Cash
proceeds of $30.0 million were received from the new Wells Fargo secured term loan that were used to extinguish the Cerberus senior term loan in full during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015. Cash of $48 thousand was paid for
debt financing fees during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 related to the Ninth Amendment to the loan agreement effective September 2, 2016. Additionally, the Company was subject to a penalty of $0.3 million, which was equal
to 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance and was paid during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 on the early extinguishment of debt. Proceeds of $31 thousand were received in connection with the exercise of stock options during the thirty-nine
weeks ended October 31, 2015.      Existing Credit Facilities    
 Gordmans, Inc. is the borrower under a loan, guaranty and security agreement dated as of February 20, 2009, as amended, with Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association as agent and a lender and with certain other lender parties thereto from time to time. Gordmans Stores, Inc., Gordmans Intermediate Holdings Corp., Gordmans Distribution Company, Inc., Gordmans Management Company, Inc. and Gordmans LLC
are all guarantors under the loan agreement. The description which follows includes the terms of the Ninth Amendment to the loan agreement, which became effective September 2, 2016 (the  Ninth Amendment ). The Ninth Amendment
increases the borrowing availability under its revolving line of credit facility from $80.0 million to $100.0 million. In connection with the revolving line of credit facility increase, the Company s borrowing base term loan reserve calculation
now includes a minimum term loan reserve of $5.0 million.    The loan, guaranty and security agreement provides for a $100.0 million revolving line of
credit facility. Our revolving line of credit facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes and is scheduled to expire on June 28, 2020. At October 29, 2016, we had $58.0 million of borrowings outstanding
under our revolving line of credit facility as compared to outstanding borrowings of $17.0 million at January 30, 2016 and $35.9 million at October 31, 2015. The availability of our revolving line of credit facility is subject to a
borrowing base, which is comprised of eligible credit card receivables and the liquidation value of eligible landed inventory, eligible distribution center inventory and eligible in-transit inventory less a minimum term loan reserve of $5.0 million.
The Company is required to maintain minimum excess availability under the revolving line of credit facility of at least $20.0 million, the calculation of which includes up to $3.0 million of unrestricted cash. Excess availability under our revolving
line of credit facility was $36.1 million at October 29, 2016 and included letters of credit issued with an aggregate face amount of $9.0 million.  
      23  

Table of Contents  

There were borrowings under the facility of an aggregate of $179.5 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 and repayments of $138.6 million during the first three quarters of
fiscal 2016.    Interest is payable on borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility monthly at a rate equal to LIBOR or the base rate as selected
by management, plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.75% to 2.00% set quarterly dependent upon the whether excess availability is less than or greater than $40.0 million. Borrowings under this facility totaling $5.0 million bore interest at
a rate of 4.25% under the base rate option and $53.0 million bore interest at rates between 2.28% and 2.29% under the LIBOR option at October 29, 2016.  
 An unused line fee is payable quarterly in an amount equal to 0.25% of the sum of the average daily unused revolver amount during the immediately preceding
month plus the average daily balance of the letter of credit usage during the immediately preceding month. An administrative agent fee is also payable under the facility on an annual basis.  
 The revolving line of credit facility has a first lien on all collateral other than term loan priority collateral and a second lien on the term loan priority
collateral, as defined in the loan agreement.    The secured term loan matures on the same date as the revolving line of credit facility and has principal
payments of $0.4 million due on a quarterly basis beginning in October 2015 through the maturity date, with the remaining principal due on the maturity date of June 28, 2020. The Company may repay at any time all or a portion of the outstanding
principal amount of the secured term loan facility, subject to a prepayment premium equal to 3.0% in the first year, 1.5% in the second year, 0.5% in the third year and 0.0% thereafter. The term loan carries an interest rate equal to the LIBOR rate
plus 6.25% with a floor of 1.0%. The interest rate on the term loan was 7.25% at October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016, and October 31, 2015. The term loan is secured by the same collateral as the revolving line of credit facility
but has a priority lien on real estate, fixtures, equipment, intellectual property and books, records, permits, licenses, insurance, in each case related to term loan priority collateral, and proceeds thereof and a second lien on the revolving
priority collateral, as defined in the loan agreement.    Among other provisions, the Company s loan agreement with Wells Fargo contains customary
affirmative and negative covenants, including a negative covenant that restricts the level and form of indebtedness entered into by the Company or its wholly owned subsidiaries. Exceptions to this covenant include borrowings under our $30.0 million
senior term loan and, subject to certain conditions, indebtedness in connection with all acquisitions not to exceed $10.0 million. Our revolving line of credit facility also includes a negative covenant that restricts dividends and other upstream
distributions by the Company and its subsidiaries to the extent the Company does not meet minimum excess availability thresholds. Exceptions to this covenant include dividends or other upstream distributions: (i) by subsidiaries of
Gordmans, Inc. to Gordmans, Inc. and its other subsidiaries, (ii) that consist of repurchases of stock of employees in an amount not to exceed $0.5 million in any fiscal year, (iii) that consist of the payment of taxes on behalf of any
employee, officer or director of the Company for vested restricted stock of the Company owned by such employee, officer or director, (iv) to the Company to pay federal, state and local income taxes and franchise taxes solely arising out of the
consolidated operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, (v) to the Company to pay certain reasonable directors  fees and out-of-pocket expenses, reasonable and customary indemnities to directors, officers and employees and other
expenses in connection with the ordinary corporate governance, overhead, legal and accounting and maintenance and (vi) dividends so long no event of default exists, projected excess availability for the next twelve months is greater than $35.0
million and 30% of the loan cap and the fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than 1.0 to 1.0 on a historical and projected basis. The agreement also includes a negative covenant that restricts subsidiaries of the Company from making any loans
to the Company. Should the Company default on scheduled repayment of the secured term loan facility, Wells Fargo may make any outstanding obligations under the agreement immediately due and payable.  
 As of October 29, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and expects to be in compliance with all of its debt covenants for
measurement periods occurring through the remainder of fiscal 2016.    We also entered into two capital leases to purchase computer hardware and software
during fiscal 2014. The Company s remaining obligation under theses capital leases was $0.6 million at October 29, 2016.     Contractual
Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements     There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements
as described on page 45 in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 We have determined that our most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventories, property and equipment,
long-lived assets, operating leases, self-insurance, share-based compensation and income taxes. There have been no significant changes to critical accounting policies discussed in our fiscal year 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K except for
the adoption of ASU 2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount
of that debt liability. We continue to monitor our accounting policies to ensure proper application of current rules and regulations.      
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Interest Rate Risk    
 We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility and through outstanding borrowings on our secured
term loan, both of which bear interest at variable rates.    Borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility bear interest at various rates, with two
rate options at the discretion of management as follows: (1) for base rate advances, borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus 1.00% when average excess availability is less than or equal to $40.0 million and the prime rate plus 0.75%
when average excess availability is greater than $40.0 million, and (2) for LIBOR rate advances, borrowings bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.00% when average excess availability is less than or equal to $40.0 million and the LIBOR rate
plus 1.75% when average excess availability is greater than $40.0 million. Borrowings and repayments under our revolving line of credit facility may not exceed the lesser of a calculated borrowing base or $100.0 million. Borrowings and
repayments under our revolving line of credit facility during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 were $179.5 million and $138.6 million respectively, with $58.0 million being the largest amount borrowed at one time during the
thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016. Borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit facility were $58.0 million at October 29, 2016. Average borrowings during the first three quarters fiscal 2016 were $31.7 million. We
performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point movement in interest rates applied to the average daily borrowings of our revolving line of credit facility. As of October 29, 2016, the analysis indicated that such a
movement would result in an increase to interest expense of approximately $0.3 million per year.    Borrowings under our term loan bear interest at an
interest rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus 6.25% with a floor of 1.00% (7.25% at October 29, 2016). We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the interest rate applied to the average amount
outstanding on the term loan. As of October 29, 2016, the analysis indicated that such a movement would result in an increase to interest expense of approximately $0.3 million per year.  
    ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
 The required certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are included as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The
disclosures set forth in this Item 4 contain information concerning the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and changes in internal control over financial reporting referred to in
those certifications. Those certifications should be read in conjunction with this Item 4 for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by the certifications.  
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure     Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 29, 2016 to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

     PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   
    ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
 We are subject to various legal claims and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of our business, including employment related claims, involving
routine claims incidental to our business. Although the outcome of these routine claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition or cash flow.       ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   
 Except as set forth below, our risk factors have not changed materially from those disclosed in our fiscal year 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk
factors set forth below and the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, in addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, could materially affect our business, financial condition or results.  
   Our common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market if our stock price continues to trade below $1.00 per share.    
 On October 31, 2016, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ, notifying us
that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The NASDAQ Global Select Market pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). In
accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been given 180 calendar days, or until May 1, 2017, to regain compliance with Rule 5450(a)(1). If at any time before May 1, 2017, the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00
per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will provide written confirmation that we have achieved compliance with Rule 5450(a)(1). If we do not regain compliance with Rule 5450(a)(1) by May 1, 2017, we may be
afforded a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, we must meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The NASDAQ Global Select Market, except
for the minimum bid price requirement. In addition, we would be required to notify NASDAQ of our intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency, which may include, if necessary, implementing a reverse stock split.  
 If we do not regain compliance with Rule 5450(a)(1) by May 1, 2017, and are not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, NASDAQ will
provide written notification that our common stock may be delisted. At that time, we may appeal the NASDAQ delisting determination to a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel. Our common stock would remain listed pending the Panel s
decision. There can be no assurance that if we appeal a delisting determination, that such appeal would be successful.    We plan to continue to monitor the
bid price for our common stock and consider various options available to us if our common stock does not trade at a level that is likely to regain compliance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid
price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other NASDAQ listing criteria.      We depend on a small number of factoring companies for a
significant portion of our merchandise inventory purchases and our business is highly dependent on our vendors  ability to obtain financing through these factoring companies.    
 Our ability to obtain merchandise depends on certain manufacturers  ability to obtain vendor financing through factoring companies, and to the extent
they are unable to secure sufficient credit from those factors, we may not be able to purchase merchandise from them. Although we do not depend on any single factoring company, a significant amount of our merchandise inventory is purchased and
factored by a small number of factoring companies. Increasing pressures in the retail industry and on our business may make it more difficult for our vendors to obtain financing through factoring companies on acceptable terms or at all. The loss of
key factors, or the inability of our vendors to obtain factor financing on acceptable terms, could make it more difficult for us to acquire sufficient quantities of merchandise within our borrowing constraints which could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.       ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
