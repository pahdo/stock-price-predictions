Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other periodic reports filed by Regions Financial Corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf to analysts, investors, the media and others, may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The terms  Regions,  the  Company,   we,   us  and  our  mean Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries when or where appropriate. The words  anticipates,   intends,   plans,   seeks,   believes,   estimates,   expects,   targets,   projects,   outlook,   forecast,   will,   may,   could,   should,   can,  and similar expressions often signify forward-looking statements  .   Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information, but rather are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the statements are made. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, and because they also relate to the future they are likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those described below: 
             
    Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in the communities we serve, including the effects of declines in property values, unemployment rates and potential reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and conditions.  
                
    Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. 
                
    The effects of a possible downgrade in the U.S. government s sovereign credit rating or outlook, which could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict. 
                
    Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity. 
                
    Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit, or other factors. 
                
    Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible impairment of the collectability of loans. 
                
    Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs, loan loss provisions or actual loan losses where our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses. 
                
    Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those securities. 
                
    Our ability to effectively compete with other financial services companies, some of whom possess greater financial resources than we do and are subject to different regulatory standards than we are. 
                
    Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs. 
                
    Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective customers for new products and services in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our revenue. 
                
    The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our subsidiaries. 
                
    Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, such as the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, which could require us to change certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses. 
                
    Our ability to obtain a regulatory non-objection (as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) to take certain capital actions, including paying dividends and any plans to increase common stock dividends, repurchase common stock under current or future programs, or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, may impact our ability to return capital to stockholders and market perceptions of us.  
                
    Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements (as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance and intensity of such tests and requirements. 
                
    Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements (including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards and the LCR rule), including our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition could be negatively impacted.

Table of Contents     

The Basel III framework calls for additional risk-based capital surcharges for globally systemically important banks.  Although we are not subject to such surcharges, it is possible that in the future we may become subject to similar surcharges. 
                
    The costs, including possibly incurring fines, penalties, or other negative effects (including reputational harm) of any adverse judicial, administrative, or arbitral rulings or proceedings, regulatory enforcement actions, or other legal actions to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, and which may adversely affect our results.  
                
    Our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet exposure so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to support our business. 
                
    Our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans, including our ability to fully realize the financial and non-financial benefits relating to our strategic initiatives. 
                
    The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers. 
                
    Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits, which could adversely affect our net income. 
                
    Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to assist in the development, management and operation of our products and services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from time to time. 
                
    Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners. 
                
    Any inaccurate or incomplete information provided to us by our customers or counterparties. 
                
    The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition and integration of other companies. 
                
    Inability of our framework to manage risks associated with our business such as credit risk and operational risk, including third-party vendors and other service providers, which could, among other things, result in a breach of operating or security systems as a result of a cyber attack or similar act.  
                
    The inability of our internal disclosure controls and procedures to prevent, detect or mitigate any material errors or fraudulent acts. 
                
    The effects of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts and terrorist attacks and the potential impact, directly or indirectly, on our businesses. 
                
    The effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods, droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, and environmental damage, which may negatively affect our operations and/or our loan portfolios and increase our cost of conducting business. 
                
    Changes in commodity market prices and conditions could adversely affect the cash flows of our borrowers operating in industries that are impacted by changes in commodity prices (including businesses indirectly impacted by commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment used in the production of commodities), which could impair their ability to service any loans outstanding to them and/or reduce demand for loans in those industries. 
                
    Our inability to keep pace with technological changes could result in losing business to competitors. 
                
    Our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches,  denial of service  attacks,  hacking  and identity theft, a failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information; disruption or damage to our systems; increased costs; losses; or adverse effects to our reputation.  
                
    Our ability to realize our efficiency ratio target as part of our expense management initiatives. 
                
    Significant disruption of, or loss of public confidence in, the Internet and services and devices used to access the Internet could affect the ability of our customers to access their accounts and conduct banking transactions. 
                
    Possible downgrades in our credit ratings or outlook could increase the costs of funding from capital markets.  
                
    The effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions that adversely affect us or the banking industry generally could require us to change certain business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses. 
                
    The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses; result in the disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary information; increase our costs; negatively affect our reputation; and cause losses.  
                
    Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends to stockholders. 
                
    Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies could materially affect how we report our financial results.

REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
  Three and     Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015    
   
  NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Regions Financial Corporation ( Regions  or the "Company ) provides a full range of banking and bank-related services to individual and corporate customers through its subsidiaries and branch offices located across the South, Midwest and Texas. The Company competes with other financial institutions located in the states in which it operates, as well as other adjoining states. Regions is subject to the regulations of certain government agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by certain regulatory authorities. 
  The accounting and reporting policies of Regions and the methods of applying those policies that materially affect the consolidated financial statements conform with GAAP and with general financial services industry practices. The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all information and notes to the consolidated financial statements necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring items, necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements have been included. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Regions  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Regions has evaluated all subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the filing date of this Form 10-Q. 
  On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into an agreement to sell Morgan Keegan and related affiliates. The transaction closed on April 2, 2012. See Note 2 and Note 14 for further details. Results of operations for the entities sold are presented separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented on the consolidated statements of income. This presentation is consistent with the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, Regions reclassified its investments in FRB and FHLB stock from securities available for sale to other earning assets on its consolidated balance sheets. This reclassification has been made for all periods presented. Certain other prior period amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications are immaterial and have no effect on net income, comprehensive income, total assets, or total stockholders  equity as previously reported. 
   
  NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
  On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. The transaction closed on April 2, 2012. Regions Investment Management, Inc. (formerly known as Morgan Asset Management, Inc.) and Regions Trust were not included in the sale. In connection with the closing of the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all litigation matters related to pre-closing activities. See Note 14 for related disclosure. 
  The following table represents the condensed results of operations for discontinued operations:

Table of Contents     

_________ 
  (1) The gross unrealized losses recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) on held to maturity securities resulted from a transfer of available for sale securities to held to maturity in the second quarter of 2013. 
    
  Securities with carrying values of   $10.9 billion   and   $11.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged to secure public funds, trust deposits and certain borrowing arrangements. Included within total pledged securities is approximately   $51 million   and   $50 million   of encumbered U.S. Treasury securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Table of Contents     

The following tables present gross unrealized losses and the related estimated fair value of securities available for sale and held to maturity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . For securities transferred to held to maturity from available for sale, the analysis in the tables below is comparing the securities' original amortized cost to its current estimated fair value. These securities are segregated between investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and for twelve months or more. 

16 

Table of Contents     

The number of individual positions in an unrealized loss position in the tables above   decrease  d from   1,081   at   December 31, 2015   to   520   at   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in the number of securities and the total amount of unrealized losses from year-end 2015 was primarily due to changes in market interest rates. In instances where an unrealized loss existed, there was no indication of an adverse change in credit on the underlying positions in the tables above. As it relates to these positions, management believes no individual unrealized loss, other than those discussed below, represented an other-than-temporary impairment as of those dates. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, the positions before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. 
  As part of the Company's normal process for evaluating other-than-temporary impairments, management did identify a limited number of positions where an other-than-temporary impairment was believed to exist as of   September 30, 2016  . Such impairments were related to available for sale equity securities with current market values below the highest traded price in the last six months. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , such impairments totaled   $1 million  , and have been reflected as a reduction of net securities gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of income. 
  Gross realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of securities available for sale, as well as other-than-temporary impairment losses, are shown in the table below. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

NOTE 4. LOANS AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
  LOANS 
  The following table presents the distribution of Regions' loan portfolio by segment and class, net of unearned income: 

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Regions purchased approximately   $200 million   and   $310 million  , respectively, in indirect-vehicles and indirect-other consumer loans from third parties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the comparable loan purchase amounts were approximately   $779 million   and   $857 million  , respectively.  
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $14.7 billion   in securities and net eligible loans held by Regions were pledged to secure current and potential borrowings from the FHLB. At   September 30, 2016  , an additional   $19.7 billion   in net eligible loans held by Regions were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank for potential borrowings. 
  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
  Regions determines the appropriate level of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis. Refer to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to the consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , for a description of the methodology. 
  ROLLFORWARD OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
  The following tables present analyses of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . The total allowance for loan losses and the related loan portfolio ending balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are disaggregated to detail the amounts derived through individual evaluation and collective evaluation for impairment. The allowance for loan losses related to individually evaluated loans is attributable to reserves for non-accrual commercial and investor real estate loans and all TDRs. The allowance for loan losses and the loan portfolio ending balances related to collectively evaluated loans is attributable to the remainder of the portfolio.

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT RISK FACTORS  
  The following describe the risk characteristics relevant to each of the portfolio segments. 
  Commercial   The commercial loan portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansion projects. Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by business operations. Owner-occupied construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness of underlying borrowers, particularly cash flow from customers  business operations, and the sensitivity to market fluctuations in commodity prices. 
  Investor Real Estate   Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions  investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions  markets. Additionally, these loans are made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Loans in this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the valuation of real estate. 
  Consumer   The consumer loan portfolio segment includes residential first mortgage, home equity, indirect-vehicles, indirect-other consumer, consumer credit card, and other consumer loans. Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a   15   to   30   year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market values as of the time the loan or line is secured directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses. Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive dealerships. Indirect-other consumer lending represents other point of sale lending through third parties. Consumer credit card includes Regions branded consumer credit card accounts. Other consumer loans include other revolving consumer accounts, direct consumer loans, and overdrafts. Loans in this portfolio segment are sensitive to unemployment and other key consumer economic measures.

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS 
  The following tables present credit quality indicators for the loan portfolio segments and classes, excluding loans held for sale, as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . Commercial and investor real estate loan portfolio segments are detailed by categories related to underlying credit quality and probability of default. Regions assigns these categories at loan origination and reviews the relationship utilizing a risk-based approach on, at minimum, an annual basis or at any time management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in this review process. These categories are utilized to develop the associated allowance for credit losses. 
             
    Pass includes obligations where the probability of default is considered low; 
                
    Special Mention includes obligations that have potential weakness that may, if not reversed or corrected, weaken the credit or inadequately protect the Company s position at some future date. Obligations in this category may also be subject to economic or market conditions that may, in the future, have an adverse effect on debt service ability; 
                
    Substandard Accrual includes obligations that exhibit a well-defined weakness that presently jeopardizes debt repayment, even though they are currently performing. These obligations are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company may incur a loss in the future if these weaknesses are not corrected; 
                
    Non-accrual includes obligations where management has determined that full payment of principal and interest is in doubt. 
     Substandard accrual and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to as  classified.  Special mention, substandard accrual, and non-accrual loans are often collectively referred to as  criticized and classified.  Classes in the consumer portfolio segment are disaggregated by accrual status.

Table of Contents     

The following table presents the average balances of total impaired loans and interest income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Interest income recognized represents interest on accruing loans modified in a TDR. TDRs are considered impaired loans. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS  
  Regions regularly modifies commercial and investor real estate loans in order to facilitate a workout strategy. Similarly,  Regions works to meet the individual needs of consumer borrowers to stem foreclosure through its CAP program. Refer to Note 6 "Allowance For Credit Losses" in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's TDRs.  
  None of the modified consumer loans listed in the following TDR disclosures were collateral-dependent at the time of modification. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $38 million   in residential first mortgage TDRs were in excess of   180   days past due and were considered collateral-dependent. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $5 million   in home equity first lien TDRs were in excess of   180   days past due and approximately   $4 million   in home equity second lien TDRs were in excess of   120   days past due, both of which were considered collateral-dependent. 
  Further discussion related to TDRs, including their impact on the allowance for loan losses and designation of TDRs in periods subsequent to the modification is included in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following tables present the end of period balance for loans modified in a TDR during the periods presented by portfolio segment and class, and the financial impact of those modifications. The tables include modifications made to new TDRs, as well as renewals of existing TDRs. Loans first reported as TDRs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   totaled approximately   $347 million   and   $217 million  , respectively.

Defaulted TDRs 
  The following table presents, by portfolio segment and class, TDRs that defaulted during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and that were modified in the previous twelve months (i.e., the twelve months prior to the default). For purposes of this disclosure, default is defined as   90   days past due and still accruing for the consumer portfolio segment, and placement on non-accrual status for the commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments. Consideration of defaults in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses is described in detail in the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  
   29 

Table of Contents     

Commercial and investor real estate loans that were on non-accrual status at the time of the latest modification are not included in the default table above, as they are already considered to be in default at the time of the restructuring. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $66 million   of commercial and investor real estate loans modified in a TDR during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were on non-accrual status. Approximately   1.2 percent   of this amount was   90   days past due. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Regions had restructured binding unfunded commitments totaling   $51 million   where a concession was granted and the borrower was in financial difficulty. 
   
  NOTE 5. SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS  
  RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES 
  The fair value of residential MSRs is calculated using various assumptions including future cash flows, market discount rates, expected prepayment rates, servicing costs and other factors. A significant change in prepayments of mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation adjustments, thus creating potential volatility in the carrying amount of residential MSRs. The Company compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. 
  The table below presents an analysis of residential MSRs under the fair value measurement method: 
   
 ________ 
  (1) "Economic amortization associated with borrower repayments" includes both total loan payoffs as well as partial paydowns.  
    
  On February 29, 2016, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately   $2.6 billion   in residential mortgage loans for approximately   $24 million  .  
    
  On September 1, 2016, the Company purchased the rights to service approximately   $2.8 billion   in residential mortgage loans for approximately   $22 million  .  However, the Company paid   $11 million   as of September 30, 2016 and the balance of   $11 million   will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Table of Contents     

Data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, as well as the valuation s sensitivity to rate fluctuations, related to residential MSRs (excluding related derivative instruments) are as follows: 

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of residential MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumption, while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. The derivative instruments utilized by Regions would serve to reduce the estimated impacts to fair value included in the table above. 
  The following table presents servicing related fees, which includes contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary income resulting from the servicing of residential mortgage loans: 

Residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with standard representations and warranties regarding certain characteristics such as the quality of the loan, the absence of fraud, the eligibility of the loan for sale and the future servicing associated with the loan. Regions may be required to repurchase these loans at par, or make-whole or indemnify the purchasers for losses incurred when representations and warranties are breached. 
  Regions maintains an immaterial repurchase liability related to residential mortgage loans sold with representations and warranty provisions. This repurchase liability is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and reflects management s estimate of losses based on historical repurchase and loss trends, as well as other factors that may result in anticipated losses different from historical loss trends. Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in other non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income.  
  COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES 
  On July 18, 2014, Regions was approved as a Fannie Mae DUS lender and acquired a DUS servicing portfolio totaling approximately   $1.0 billion  . The Fannie Mae DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-family housing market. As part of the transaction, Regions recorded   $12 million   in commercial MSRs and   $15 million   in intangible assets associated with the DUS license purchased. Regions also assumed a loss share guarantee associated with the purchased portfolio and any future originations. Regions estimated the fair value of the loss share guarantee to be approximately   $4 million  . See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Also see Note 14 herein for additional information related to the guarantee. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the DUS servicing portfolio was approximately   $1.7 billion   and   $1.2 billion  , respectively. The related commercial MSRs were valued at approximately   $28 million   and   $16 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The loss share guarantee was valued at approximately   $3 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

NOTE 6. GOODWILL  
  Goodwill allocated to each reportable segment (each a reporting unit) is presented as follows:    

Regions evaluates each reporting unit s goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  A detailed description of the Company s methodology and valuation approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is included in the consolidated financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations, or other factors could result in a decline in the implied fair value of goodwill.  
  During the third quarter of 2016, Regions assessed events and circumstances for all three reporting units as of September 30, 2016, and through the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that could potentially indicate goodwill impairment. The indicators assessed included: 
             
    Recent operating performance, 
                
    Changes in market capitalization, 
                
    Regulatory actions and assessments, 
                
    Changes in the business climate (including legislation, legal factors, and competition), 
                
    Company-specific factors (including changes in key personnel, asset impairments, and business dispositions), and 
                
    Trends in the banking industry. 
     During the first quarter of  2016, Regions reorganized its internal management structure and, accordingly, its segment reporting structure. Due to the organizational realignment, Regions determined that quantitative testing of goodwill was required for all reporting units, and goodwill was reallocated to each reporting unit using a relative fair value approach. Results of the first quarter 2016 goodwill test indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amounts as of the test date. Additionally, after assessing the indicators noted above, Regions determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units had declined below their carrying value as of September 30, 2016. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of goodwill impairment was not required for each of Regions  reporting units for the September 30, 2016 interim period.

NOTE 7. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 
  PREFERRED STOCK 
    The following table presents a summary of the non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock:       
   
 _________ 
  (1)  Dividends, if declared, will be paid quarterly at an annual rate equal to (i) for each period beginning prior to September 15, 2024,   6.375%  , and (ii) for each period beginning on or after September 15, 2024, three-month LIBOR plus   3.536%  . 
  For each preferred stock issuance listed above, Regions issued depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of the Company's preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of   $1,000.00   per share of preferred stock (equivalent to   $25.00   per depositary share). Dividends on the preferred stock, if declared, accrue and are payable quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock has no stated maturity and redemption is solely at Regions' option, subject to regulatory approval, in whole, or in part, after the earliest redemption date or in whole, but not in part, within   90 days   following a regulatory capital treatment event for the Series A preferred stock or at any time following a regulatory capital treatment event for the Series B preferred stock.  
  The Board of Directors declared   $8 million   in cash dividends on Series A Preferred Stock during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and 2015. Series B Preferred Stock dividends were also   $8 million   for each of the first three quarters of 2016 and 2015. Prior to the first quarter of 2016, the Company was in a retained deficit position and preferred dividends were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company achieved positive retained earnings and preferred dividends were recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. 
  In the event Series A and Series B preferred shares are redeemed at the liquidation amounts,   $113 million   and   $67 million   excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount will be recognized, respectively. Approximately   $100 million   of Series A preferred dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, and approximately   $13 million   of related issuance costs that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders.  Approximately   $52 million   of Series B preferred dividends that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, and approximately   $15 million   of related issuance costs that were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus, will be recorded as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders. 
  COMMON STOCK 
  On June 29, 2016, Regions received no objection from the Federal Reserve to its 2016 capital plan that was submitted as part of the CCAR process. In addition to continuing the $0.065 quarterly common stock dividend, actions that Regions may undertake as outlined in its capital plan include the repurchase of up to $640 million in common shares. The capital plan also provides the potential for a dividend increase beginning in the second quarter of 2017, which is expected to be considered by the Board in early 2017.  
  On July 14, 2016, Regions' Board authorized a new   $640 million   common stock repurchase plan, permitting repurchases from the beginning of the third quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017. As of September 30, 2016, Regions had repurchased approximately   23.1 million   shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately   $215 million  . On October 12, 2016, Regions' Board authorized an additional   $120 million   repurchase, which increases the total amount authorized under the plan to   $760 million  . The Company continued to repurchase shares under this plan in the fourth quarter of 2016, and as of November 3, 2016, Regions had additional repurchases of approximately   10.9 million   shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately   $116.7 million  . All of these shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore will not be included in treasury stock. 
  The Board declared a   $0.065   per share cash dividend on common stock for the second and   third quarter  s of   2016   and   $0.06   per common share for the first quarter of 2016, totaling   $0.19   per share cash dividend for the first nine months of 2016.  The Board declared a   $0.06   per share cash dividend on common stock for the second and third quarters of 2015, and a   $0.05   per share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2015, totaling   $0.17   per share cash dividend for the first nine months of 2015. Prior to the first quarter of 2016, the Company was in a retained deficit position and common stock dividends were recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company achieved positive retained earnings and common stock dividends were recorded as a reduction of retained earnings.

________ 
  (1)  Amounts in parentheses indicate reductions to net income. 
  (2)  These accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost and are included in salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of income (see Note 10 for additional details).

NOTE 8. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE 
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings (loss) per common share and diluted earnings (loss) per common share: 

________ 
           (1) 
     Certain per share amounts may not appear to reconcile due to rounding. 
     For earnings (loss) per common share from discontinued operations, basic and diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding are the same for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to a net loss. 
  The effect from the assumed exercise of   27 million   and   29 million   stock options for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, was not included in the above computations of diluted earnings per common share because such amounts would have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per common share. The effect from the assumed exercise of   29 million    stock options for both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was not included in the above computations of diluted earnings per common share because such amounts would have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per common share.  
   
  NOTE 9. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS  
  Regions administers long-term incentive compensation plans that permit the granting of incentive awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock awards, performance awards and stock appreciation rights. While Regions has the ability to issue stock appreciation rights, none have been issued to date. The terms of all awards issued under these plans are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board; however, no awards may be granted after the tenth anniversary from the date the plans were initially approved by stockholders. Incentive awards usually vest based on employee service, generally within   three   years from the date of the grant. The contractual lives of options granted under these plans are typically   ten   years from the date of the grant. 
  On April 23, 2015, the stockholders of the Company approved the Regions Financial Corporation 2015 LTIP , which permits the Company to grant to employees and directors various forms of incentive compensation. These forms of incentive compensation are similar to the types of compensation approved in prior plans. The 2015 LTIP authorizes   60 million   common share equivalents  
  
   37 

Table of Contents     

available for grant, where grants of options and grants of full value awards (e.g., shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units) count as one share equivalent. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board, grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance stock units accrue dividends, or their notional equivalent, as they are declared by the Board, and are paid upon vesting of the award. Upon adoption of the 2015 LTIP, Regions closed the prior long-term incentive plan to new grants, and, accordingly, prospective grants must be made under the 2015 LTIP or a successor plan. All existing grants under prior long-term incentive plans are unaffected by adoption of the 2015 LTIP. The number of remaining share equivalents available for future issuance under the 2015 LTIP was approximately   48 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  STOCK OPTIONS  
  The following table summarizes the activity related to stock options: 

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS 
  Regions periodically grants restricted stock awards that vest upon service conditions. Regions also periodically grants restricted stock awards and performance stock awards that vest based upon service conditions and performance conditions. Incremental shares earned above the performance target associated with previous performance stock awards are included when and if performance targets are achieved. Dividend payments during the vesting period are deferred to the end of the vesting term. The fair value of these restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance stock units was estimated based upon the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of the grant. The valuation was not adjusted for the deferral of dividends. 
  The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted stock awards and performance stock awards:

NOTE 10. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 
  Regions has a defined benefit pension plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code covering only certain employees as the pension plan is closed to new entrants. The Company also sponsors a SERP, which is a non-qualified pension plan that provides certain senior executive officers defined benefits in relation to their compensation. 
  Net periodic pension cost, which is recorded in salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of income, included the following components: 

On December 31, 2015, Regions changed the basis for determining the assumption used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic pension costs for pension and other postretirement benefits. This change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs and resulted in an immaterial impact to the pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, Regions separated the Regions Financial Corporation Retirement Plan into two plans, effective January 1, 2016, creating a new plan primarily for participants who remained actively employed as of that date. The corresponding assets and liabilities of these participants will be transferred to the new plan in 2016. All other participants will remain in the existing plan. See Note 18 "Employee Benefit Plans" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further discussion.  
  Regions' policy for funding the qualified pension plan is to contribute annually at least the amount required by the IRS minimum funding standards. Regions made no contribution to the plan during the first nine months of 2016. 
  Regions also provides other postretirement benefits such as defined benefit health care plans and life insurance plans that cover certain retired employees. There was no material impact from other postretirement benefits on the consolidated financial statements for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  .

NOTE 11. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
  The following tables present the notional amount and estimated fair value of derivative instruments on a gross basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
   
 _________ 
           (1) 
    Derivatives in a gain position are recorded as other assets and derivatives in a loss position are recorded as other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
     HEDGING DERIVATIVES 
  Derivatives entered into to manage interest rate risk and facilitate asset/liability management strategies are designated as hedging derivatives. Derivative financial instruments that qualify in a hedging relationship are classified, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , for additional information regarding accounting policies for derivatives. 
  FAIR VALUE HEDGES 
  Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment.  
  Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposure on the Company s fixed-rate borrowings, which include long-term debt and certificates of deposit. These agreements involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments over the life of the agreements. Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposure on certain of the Company's fixed-rate available for sale debt securities. These agreements involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest receipts. 
  CASH FLOW HEDGES 
  Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions.  
  Regions enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage overall cash flow changes related to interest rate risk exposure on LIBOR-based loans. The agreements effectively modify the Company s exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing receive fixed/pay LIBOR interest rate swaps. 
  Regions issues long-term fixed-rate debt for various funding needs. Regions may enter into receive LIBOR/pay fixed forward starting swaps to hedge risks of changes in the projected quarterly interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR) during the time leading up to the probable issuance date of the new long-term fixed-rate debt. 
  Regions recognized an unrealized after-tax gain of   $179 million   and   $24 million   in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to terminated cash flow hedges of loan instruments, which will be  
  
   40 

Table of Contents     

amortized into earnings in conjunction with the recognition of interest payments through 2025. Regions recognized pre-tax income of   $22 million   and   $11 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and pre-tax income of   $46 million   and   $33 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to the amortization of cash flow hedges of loan instruments. 
  Regions expects to reclassify out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and into earnings approximately   $123 million   in pre-tax income due to the receipt or payment of interest payments on all cash flow hedges within the next twelve months. Included in this amount is   $76 million   in pre-tax net gains related to the amortization of discontinued cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which Regions is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is approximately   nine years   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following tables present the effect of hedging derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of income:

Table of Contents     

______ 
  (1) After-tax 
  (2) Pre-tax 
  (3) All cash flow hedges were highly effective for all periods presented, and the change in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was not material. 
    
  DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS 
  The Company holds a portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts, and futures and forward commitments that result from transactions with its commercial customers in which they manage their risks by entering into a derivative with Regions. The Company monitors and manages the net risk in this customer portfolio and enters into separate derivative contracts in order to reduce the overall exposure to pre-defined limits. For both derivatives with its end customers and derivatives Regions enters into to mitigate the risk in this portfolio, the Company is subject to market risk and the risk that the counterparty will default. The contracts in this portfolio are not designated as accounting hedges and are marked-to market through earnings (in capital markets fee income and other) and included in other assets and other liabilities, as appropriate. 
  Regions enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Regions had   $446 million   and   $322 million  , respectively, in total notional amount of interest rate lock commitments. Regions manages market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale with corresponding forward sale commitments. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage income. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at either the lower of cost or market or at fair value based on management's election. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Regions had   $802 million   and   $666 million  , respectively, in total notional amounts related to these forward sale commitments. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to residential mortgage loans are included in mortgage income. Changes in mark-to-market from both interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sale commitments related to commercial mortgage loans are included in capital markets fee income and other. 
  Regions has elected to account for residential MSRs at fair value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Concurrent with the election to use the fair value measurement method, Regions began using various derivative instruments, in the form of forward rate commitments, futures contracts, swaps and swaptions to mitigate the effect of changes in the fair value of its residential MSRs on its consolidated statements of income. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total notional amount related to these contracts was   $5.8 billion   and   $3.6 billion  , respectively. 
  The following table presents the location and amount of gain or (loss) recognized in income on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in the consolidated statements of income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 
  
   42

______ 
  (1) Capital markets fee income and other is included in Other income on the consolidated statements of income. 
  Credit risk, defined as all positive exposures not collateralized with cash or other assets or reserved for, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , totaled approximately   $463 million   and   $406 million  , respectively. These amounts represent the net credit risk on all trading and other derivative positions held by Regions. 
  CREDIT DERIVATIVES 
  Regions has both bought and sold credit protection in the form of participations on interest rate swaps (swap participations). These swap participations, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered into in the ordinary course of business to serve the credit needs of customers. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to Regions upon early termination of the swap transaction and have maturities between 2016 and 2023. Credit derivatives whereby Regions has sold credit protection have maturities between 2016 and 2025. For contracts where Regions sold credit protection, Regions would be required to make payment to the counterparty if the customer fails to make payment on any amounts due to the counterparty upon early termination of the swap transaction. Regions bases the current status of the prepayment/performance risk on bought and sold credit derivatives on recently issued internal risk ratings consistent with the risk management practices of unfunded commitments. 
  Regions  maximum potential amount of future payments under these contracts as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $90 million  . This scenario would only occur if variable interest rates were at zero percent and all counterparties defaulted with zero recovery. The fair value of sold protection at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was immaterial. In transactions where Regions has sold credit protection, recourse to collateral associated with the original swap transaction is available to offset some or all of Regions  obligation. 
  Regions has bought credit protection in the form of credit default indices. These indices, which meet the definition of credit derivatives, were entered into in the ordinary course of business to economically hedge credit spread risk in commercial mortgage loans held for sale whereby the fair value option has been elected. Credit derivatives, whereby Regions has purchased credit protection, entitle Regions to receive a payment from the counterparty if losses on the underlying index exceed a certain threshold, dependent upon the tranche rating of the capital structure. 
  CONTINGENT FEATURES 
  Certain of Regions  derivative instrument contracts with broker-dealers contain credit-related termination provisions and/or credit-related provisions regarding the posting of collateral, allowing those broker-dealers to terminate the contracts in the event that Regions  and/or Regions Bank s credit ratings falls below specified ratings from certain major credit rating agencies. The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with any credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were   $193 million   and   $180 million  , respectively, for which Regions had posted collateral of   $191 million   and   $180 million  , respectively, in the normal course of business. 
  OFFSETTING 
  Regions engages in derivatives transactions with dealers and customers. These derivatives transactions are subject to enforceable master netting agreements, which include a right of setoff by the non-defaulting or non-affected party upon early termination of the derivatives transaction. The following table presents the Company's gross derivative positions, including collateral posted or received, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   
  
   43 

Table of Contents     

________ 
           (1) 
    At   September 30, 2016  , gross amounts of derivative assets and liabilities offset in the consolidated balance sheets presented above include cash collateral received of   $271 million   and cash collateral posted of   $88 million  . At   December 31, 2015  , gross amounts of derivative assets and liabilities offset in the consolidated balance sheets presented above include cash collateral received of   $108 million   and cash collateral posted of   $256 million  .     
      Gross amounts of derivatives not subject to offsetting primarily consist of derivatives cleared through a Central Counterparty Clearing House and interest rate lock commitments to originate mortgage loans.  
   
  NOTE 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
  See Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to the consolidated financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a description of valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis. In the third quarter of 2016, Regions began utilizing OIS curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of interest rate and commodity derivatives. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements. There were no such transfers during the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Trading account securities and securities available for sale may be periodically transferred to or from Level 3 valuation based on management s conclusion regarding the observability of inputs used in valuing the securities. Such transfers are accounted for as if they occur at the beginning of a reporting period. 

44 

Table of Contents     

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and non-recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Assets and liabilities in all levels could result in volatile and material price fluctuations. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets represent only a portion of the risk to market fluctuations in Regions  consolidated balance sheets. Further, derivatives included in Levels 2 and 3 are used by the ALCO of the Company in a holistic approach to managing price fluctuation risks.

The following tables illustrate rollforwards for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The tables do not reflect the change in fair value attributable to any related economic hedges the Company used to mitigate the interest rate risk     associated with these assets and liabilities. The net changes in realized gains (losses) included in earnings related to Level 3 assets and liabilities held at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are not material.

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS 
  Trading account securities 
  The fair value in this category relates to high yield corporate securities. Significant unobservable inputs include the spread to High Yield Index. A significant increase in this input would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. 
  Securities available for sale 
  Mortgage-backed securities: residential non-agency   The fair value reported in this category relates to retained interests in legacy securitizations. Significant unobservable inputs include the spread to LIBOR, CPR, probability of default, and loss severity in the event of default. Significant increases in spread to LIBOR, probability of default and loss given default in isolation would result in significantly lower fair value. A significant increase in CPR in isolation would result in an increase to fair value. 
  Corporate and other debt securities   Significant unobservable inputs include evaluated quotes on comparable bonds for the same issuer and management-determined comparability adjustments. Changes in the evaluated quote on comparable bonds would result in a directionally similar change in the fair value of the corporate and other debt securities. 
  Commercial mortgage loans held for sale 
  Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are based on traded market prices for comparable commercial mortgage-backed securitizations, into which the loans will be placed, adjusted for movements of interest rates and credit spreads. Significant unobservable inputs include credit spreads for bonds in commercial mortgage-backed securitizations. 
  Residential mortgage servicing rights 
  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of residential MSRs are OAS and prepayment speed. This valuation requires generating cash flow projections over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting those cash flows at a risk adjusted rate. Additionally, the impact of prepayments and changes in the OAS are based on a variety of underlying inputs such as servicing costs. Increases or decreases to the underlying cash flow inputs will have a corresponding impact on the value of the MSR asset. The net change in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings related to MSRs held at period end are disclosed as the changes in valuation inputs or assumptions included in the MSR rollforward table in Note 5. See Note 5 for these amounts and additional disclosures related to assumptions used in the fair value calculation for MSRs. 
  Derivative assets 
  Residential mortgage interest rate options   These instruments are interest rate lock agreements made in the normal course of originating residential mortgage loans. Significant unobservable inputs in the fair value measurement are OAS, prepayment speeds, and pull-through. The impact of OAS and prepayment speed inputs in the valuation of these derivative instruments are consistent with the MSR discussion above. Pull-through is an estimate of the number of interest rate lock commitments that will ultimately become funded loans. Increases or decreases in the pull-through assumption will have a corresponding impact on the value of these derivative assets. 
  Commercial mortgage interest rate options   These instruments are interest rate lock agreements made in the normal course of originating commercial mortgage loans. The significant unobservable input in the fair value measurement using discounted cash flows is the internal rate of return. The Company's internal rates of return are compared against those of market competitors, and should those rates change the Company's rates would also change in a similar direction. 
  NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS 
  Loans held for sale 
  Commercial loans held for sale are valued based on multiple data points indicating the fair value for each loan. The primary data point for loans held for sale is a discount to the appraised value of the underlying collateral, which considers the return required by potential buyers of the loans. Management establishes this discount or comparability adjustment based on recent sales of loans secured by similar property types. As liquidity in the market increases or decreases, the comparability adjustment and the resulting asset valuation are impacted. These non-recurring fair value measurements are typically recorded on the date an updated appraisal is received.  
  Foreclosed property and other real estate 
  Property in foreclosure is valued based on offered quotes as available. If no sales contract is pending for a specific property, management establishes a comparability adjustment to the appraised value based on historical activity considering proceeds for properties sold versus the corresponding appraised value. Increases or decreases in realization for properties sold impact the comparability adjustment for similar assets remaining on the balance sheet. These non-recurring fair value measurements are typically recorded on the date an updated offered quote or appraisal is received.  
  
   50 

Table of Contents     

Bank owned property available for sale is valued based on estimated third-party valuations utilizing recent sales data from similar transactions. A broker's opinion of value is obtained to further support the asset valuations. Updated valuations along with actual sales results of similar properties can further impact these values. These non-recurring fair value measurements are typically recorded on the date an updated third-party valuation is received.  
  FAIR VALUE OPTION 
  Regions has elected the fair value option for all FNMA and FHLMC eligible residential mortgage loans and certain commercial mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. These elections allow for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. Regions has not elected the fair value option for other loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using derivative instruments. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets where available and/or discounted cash flows at market interest rates, adjusted for securitization activities that include servicing values and market conditions, and are recorded in loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. Fair values of commercial mortgage loans held for sale are based on traded market prices for comparable commercial mortgage-backed securitizations, into which the loans will be placed, adjusted for movements of interest rates and credit spreads. 
  The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale measured at fair value: 

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale in the consolidated statements of income. The following table details net gains (losses) resulting from changes in fair value of these loans, which were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of income during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . These changes in fair value are mostly offset by economic hedging activities. An immaterial portion of these amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values, as well as the level within the fair value hierarchy, of the Company s financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows:  

_________ 
           (1) 
    Estimated fair values are consistent with an exit price concept. The assumptions used to estimate the fair values are intended to approximate those that a market participant would use in a hypothetical orderly transaction. In estimating fair value, the Company makes adjustments for interest rates, market liquidity and credit spreads as appropriate. 
              (2) 
    The estimated fair value of portfolio loans assumes sale of the loans to a third-party financial investor. Accordingly, the value to the Company if the loans were held to maturity is not reflected in the fair value estimate. In the current whole loan market, financial investors are generally requiring a higher rate of return than the return inherent in loans if held to maturity. The fair value discount at   September 30, 2016   was   $4.1 billion   or   5.2   percent.

  NOTE 13. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  Each of Regions  reportable segments is a strategic business unit that serves specific needs of Regions  customers based on the products and services provided. The segments are based on the manner in which management views the financial performance of the business. The Company has three reportable segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other. During the first quarter of 2016, Regions reorganized its internal management structure and, accordingly, its segment reporting structure. Under the organizational realignment, Regions will continue to operate with the same three reporting units with the Relationship Management component of Business Banking moving to the Corporate Bank and the Branch Small Business component of Business Banking remaining part of the Consumer Bank. Previously, all of Business Banking was included within the Consumer Bank. The Wealth Management segment remained unchanged during the organizational realignment. Additionally, in prior years the provision for loan losses was allocated to each segment based on actual net charge-offs that had been recognized by the segment. During the first quarter of 2016, Regions began allocating the provision for loan losses to each segment using an estimated loss methodology with the difference between the consolidated provision for loan losses and the segments  estimated loss reflected in Other. Lastly, allocations of operational and overhead cost pools among the segments were modified during the first quarter of 2016 to better align the total costs to support each segment in accordance with the reorganized management structure. Segment results for all periods presented have been recast to reflect this organizational realignment, as well as the provision for loan losses methodology change and the cost allocation modifications. Additional information about the Company's reportable segments is included in Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. As these enhancements are made, financial results presented by each reportable segment may be periodically revised.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES   
  COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  
  Regions issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with lending activities. The credit risk associated with these instruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and is subject to Regions  normal credit approval policies and procedures. Regions measures inherent risk associated with these instruments by recording a reserve for unfunded commitments based on an assessment of the likelihood that the guarantee will be funded and the creditworthiness of the customer or counterparty. Collateral is obtained based on management s assessment of the creditworthiness of the customer. 
  Credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the contractual amounts indicated in the following table: 

Unused commitments to extend credit   To accommodate the financial needs of its customers, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to consumers, businesses and other entities. These commitments include (among others) credit card and other revolving credit agreements, term loan commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Many of these loan commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. 
  Standby letters of credit   Standby letters of credit are also issued to customers, which commit Regions to make payments on behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur. Regions has recourse against the customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby letter of credit. Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of credit expire without being funded. The contractual amount of standby letters of credit represents the maximum potential amount of future payments Regions could be required to make and represents Regions  maximum credit risk. 
  Commercial letters of credit   Commercial letters of credit are issued to facilitate foreign or domestic trade transactions for customers. As a general rule, drafts will be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in transit. 
  LEGAL CONTINGENCIES  
  Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to loss contingencies related to litigation, claims, investigations and legal and administrative cases and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Regions evaluates these contingencies based on information currently available, including advice of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Any accruals are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted as circumstances change. Some of Regions' exposure with respect to loss contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance  
  
   55 

Table of Contents     

coverage. In determining the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies however, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds are recorded in the period the recovery is received. 
  In addition, as previously discussed, Regions has agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal matters resulting from pre-closing activities in conjunction with the sale of Morgan Keegan and recorded an indemnification obligation at fair value in the second quarter of 2012. The indemnification obligation had a carrying amount of approximately   $32 million   and an estimated fair value of approximately   $30 million   as of   September 30, 2016   (see Note 12). 
  When it is practicable, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies, whether or not there is an accrued probable loss. When Regions is able to estimate such possible losses, and when it is reasonably possible Regions could incur losses in excess of amounts accrued, Regions discloses the aggregate estimation of such possible losses. Regions currently estimates that any such losses in excess of amounts accrued, including legal contingencies that are subject to the indemnification agreement with Raymond James, would be immaterial to Regions' financial statements as a whole. However, as available information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as well as the estimates themselves will be adjusted accordingly.  
  Assessments of litigation and claims exposure are difficult because they involve inherently unpredictable factors including, but not limited to, the following: whether the proceeding is in the early stages; whether damages are unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery has begun or is not complete; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and whether the lawsuit involves class allegations. Assessments of class action litigation, which is generally more complex than other types of litigation, are particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the proceeding when it is not known whether a class will be certified or how a potential class, if certified, will be defined. As a result, Regions may be unable to estimate reasonably possible losses with respect to some of the matters disclosed below, and the aggregated estimated amount discussed above may not include an estimate for every matter disclosed below.  
  Beginning in December 2007, Regions and certain of its affiliates were named in class-action lawsuits filed in federal and state courts on behalf of investors who purchased shares of certain Regions Morgan Keegan Select Funds (the  Funds ) and stockholders of Regions. These class-action lawsuits have all been resolved among the parties. Final court approvals for settlements in the open-end Funds class action and for the investors represented by the Trustee Ad Litem have been granted. Certain of the shareholders in these Funds and other interested parties have entered into arbitration proceedings and individual civil claims, in lieu of participating in the class actions. These lawsuits and proceedings are subject to the indemnification agreement with Raymond James discussed above. 
  In July 2006, Morgan Keegan and a former Morgan Keegan analyst were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by a Canadian insurance and financial services company and its American subsidiary in the Circuit Court of Morris County, New Jersey. Plaintiffs alleged civil claims under the RICO Act and claims for commercial disparagement, tortious interference with contractual relationships, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and common law conspiracy. Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in a multi-year conspiracy to publish and disseminate false and defamatory information about plaintiffs to improperly drive down plaintiffs  stock price, so that others could profit from short positions. Plaintiffs allege that defendants  actions damaged their reputations and harmed their business relationships. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for a number of categories of alleged damages, including lost insurance business, lost financings and increased financing costs, increased audit fees and directors and officers insurance premiums and lost acquisitions. In September 2012, the trial court dismissed the case with prejudice. Plaintiffs have filed an appeal. Oral argument was held on October 17, 2016. This matter is subject to the indemnification agreement with Raymond James. 
  A previously dismissed shareholder derivative action was refiled in June 2015. The original action alleged mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment relating to bonuses and other benefits received by executive management. The named defendants filed an opposition to the action, and on April 5, 2016, the court dismissed the action with prejudice. On May 5, 2016, plaintiffs filed a motion asking the court to reconsider the dismissal, which was denied by the court on June 24, 2016. The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Alabama Supreme Court, which dismissed the appeal on October 14, 2016. 
  Regions is involved in formal and informal information-gathering requests, investigations, reviews, examinations and proceedings by various governmental regulatory agencies, law enforcement authorities and self-regulatory bodies regarding Regions  business, Regions' business practices and policies, and the conduct of persons with whom Regions does business.  Additional inquiries will arise from time to time. In connection with those inquiries, Regions receives document requests, subpoenas and other requests for information. The inquiries, including those described below, could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions that could result in consequences that have a material effect on Regions' consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a whole. Such consequences could include adverse judgments, findings, settlements, penalties, fines, orders, injunctions, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses and collateral costs, including reputational damage.

Regions entered into a final Settlement Agreement, dated September 13, 2016, with the Department of Justice on behalf of HUD to settle and fully release previously disclosed potential claims related to Regions Bank s underwriting and origination of FHA insured mortgage loans endorsed for FHA insurance between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2011 that resulted in claims submitted through January 7, 2015. Regions had previously disclosed that it had reached an agreement in principle with the Department of Justice relating to this matter.  Regions settled this matter for   $52.4 million  , without admitting liability, in order to avoid the expense and distraction of potential litigation. Regions was fully reserved for the entire settlement amount as of the end of the second quarter of 2016. Further, Regions  insurers reimbursed Regions approximately   $47 million   of such amount, which was recognized within non-interest income in the third quarter of 2016. 
  In September 2014, Regions received an investigative request from the Office of Inspector General of the Federal Housing Finance Agency regarding its residential mortgage loan origination, underwriting and quality control practices for loans Regions sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Regions has fully cooperated with the inquiry, which is part of an industry-wide investigation.  
  While the final outcome of litigation and claims exposures or of any inquiries is inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries will not have a material effect on Regions  business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome in any of the matters discussed above could be material to Regions  business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period of occurrence.  
  GUARANTEES 
  INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION 
  As discussed in Note 2, on April 2, 2012 ( Closing Date ), Regions closed the sale of Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. In connection with the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all legal matters related to pre-closing activities, including matters filed subsequent to the Closing Date that relate to actions that occurred prior to closing. Losses under the indemnification include legal and other expenses, such as costs for judgments, settlements and awards associated with the defense and resolution of the indemnified matters. The maximum potential amount of future payments that Regions could be required to make under the indemnification is indeterminable due to the indefinite term of some of the obligations. However, Regions expects the majority of ongoing legal matters to be resolved within approximately   one   to   two   years. 
  As of the Closing Date, the fair value of the indemnification obligation, which includes defense costs and unasserted claims, was approximately   $385 million  , of which approximately   $256 million   was recognized as a reduction to the gain on sale of Morgan Keegan. The fair value was determined through the use of a present value calculation that takes into account the future cash flows that a market participant would expect to receive from holding the indemnification liability as an asset. Regions performed a probability-weighted cash flow analysis and discounted the result at a credit-adjusted risk free rate. The fair value of the indemnification liability includes amounts that Regions had previously determined meet the definition of probable and reasonably estimable. Adjustments to the indemnification obligation are recorded within professional and legal expenses within discontinued operations (see Note 2). As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of the indemnification obligation was approximately   $32 million  .

  Regions is a Fannie Mae DUS lender. The Fannie Mae DUS program provides liquidity to the multi-family housing market. Regions services loans sold to Fannie Mae and is required to provide a loss share guarantee equal to one-third of the majority of its DUS servicing portfolio. At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's DUS servicing portfolio totaled approximately   $1.7 billion   and   $1.2 billion  , respectively. Regions' maximum quantifiable contingent liability related to its loss share guarantee was approximately   $516 million   and   $356 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it services for Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of settlement. Therefore, the maximum quantifiable contingent liability is not representative of the actual loss the Company would be expected to incur. The estimated fair value of the associated loss share guarantee recorded as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets was approximately   $3 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Refer to Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for additional information.

NOTE 15. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS     
  In August 2015, the FASB issued a standard that defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard, issued in May 2014, by one year. The new revenue recognition standard is discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted as of the date of the original effective date, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Regions is in the process of reviewing the potential impact the adoption of this guidance will have to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities that supersedes existing guidance.  The new guidance: (a) requires equity investments (except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income; (b) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity securities without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (c) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (d) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (e) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income, the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (f) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets on the balance sheet or the notes to the financial statements; and (g) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.  This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is not permitted except for the amendment related to separate presentation in other comprehensive income discussed above in (e).  Entities should apply the amendments by means of cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption.  Regions is evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance intended to improve the understanding and comparability of financial statements by providing users with more information relating primarily to a lessee s leasing activities. There are no significant changes expected to the income statement but lessees will be required to record a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability equal to the present value of future rental payments on their balance sheets for all leases with a term greater than one year.  Management will also be required under the new guidance to make significant judgments regarding the likelihood of exercising lease renewal or extension options in order to determine the appropriate lease term and amount of future minimum lease payments.  While the new guidance removes the current bright lines used to classify leases, the criteria are largely similar to current lease accounting.  Additionally, the new standard substantially changes sale-leaseback accounting requiring the lessee to record a right-of-use asset and aligning sale criteria with revenue recognition guidance.  This guidance expands both quantitative and qualitative required disclosures in order to provide financial statement users information on the timing, amount, and uncertainty of future cash flows from leases.  The revised leasing guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early application permitted. Regions is evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that clarifies and enhances the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations within the new revenue recognition standard. The amendments are as follows: (a) clarification regarding how an entity should identify the unit of accounting for the principal versus agent evaluation; (b) clarification regarding how the control principle applies to transactions such as service arrangements; (c) control indicators reframed to focus on evidence of a principal relationship rather than an agency relationship, as well as clarification added regarding the relationship between the control principle and the indicators; and (d) revisions to the examples presented in current guidance as well as the addition of new examples. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Regions is evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that addresses how a change in the counterparty to a derivative contract affects a hedging relationship. This guidance clarifies that a novation (defined as replacing one counterparty to a derivative instrument with a new counterparty) of a derivative contract does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of a hedging relationship or represent a change in the critical terms of the hedge relationship so long as (a) all other hedge accounting criteria are still met, (b) the hedging relationship is expected to remain highly effective, and (c) there are no concerns about the collectability of the derivative s cash flows (i.e. the creditworthiness of the new counterparty is similar to the one being replaced). The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments may be applied prospectively or on a modified retrospective basis to all existing and new hedge accounting relationships in which a novation occurs after the effective date of the new guidance. Regions believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that clarifies that entities should solely use the four-step decision sequence described in current derivatives accounting guidance. This sequence should be used when assessing whether contingent exercise provisions associated with a put or call option are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. Based on differences in interpretation, some entities have also included an additional assessment that considers whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise the put or call is indexed only to interest rates or credit risk of the entity. This additional assessment potentially results in bifurcation of more embedded options than would occur when solely applying the decision sequence outlined in the guidance. This guidance should be applied to existing debt instruments on a modified retrospective basis and is effective for annual, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016. Regions believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that eliminates the requirement for an investor to retrospectively apply the equity method to investments when its ownership interest (or degree of influence in an investee) increases to a level that triggers the equity method of accounting. Currently, an entity must retrospectively adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods the investment was held. By eliminating this requirement, the FASB expects to reduce the cost and complexity when transitioning to the equity method. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Regions believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that intends to improve and simplify accounting for employee shared-based payments. The new guidance: (a) eliminates additional paid-in capital pools and designates that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies should be recorded in the income statement as income tax expense or benefit when the awards vest or are settled; entities should account for these income tax effects as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur and exclude them from the estimated annual effective tax rate; (b) increases the permitted tax withholding limits from the employer s statutory minimum rate to the employee s maximum statutory rate before triggering liability classification; (c) changes the classification of excess tax benefits from a financing activity to an operating activity;  (d) clarifies that cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy an employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation is a financing activity; (e) allows an entity to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either account for forfeitures based on the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2016. The transition method of accounting application (i.e. prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective application) differs by amendment and is defined in the guidance. Early adoption is permitted, but entities must adopt all of the guidance in the same period. Regions is not early adopting and believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for revenue recognition that is related to contracts with customers. This guidance is expected to clarify how an entity should evaluate revenue in circumstances regarding granting licenses of intellectual property. The guidance also includes information regarding identifying differences when dealing with promised goods and services. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Regions is evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued additional new accounting guidance for revenue recognition that is also related to contracts with customers. This guidance, as well as the guidance issued in April 2016, is intended to promote more consistent application of the standards as well as reduce the cost and complexity of applying the revenue guidance.  The guidance contains amendments related to collectability, noncash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Regions is evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance regarding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments including loans, debt securities held to maturity, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures (e.g., loan commitments, standby letters of credit, etc.).  The guidance will replace the current incurred loss accounting model with an expected loss approach, whereby entities must consider all available relevant information when estimating those expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The guidance eliminates the current accounting model for purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. Regarding securities available for sale, credit losses are to be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities, which will require remeasurement of the related allowance at each reporting period.  The guidance includes enhanced disclosure requirements intended to help financial statement users better understand estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses.  The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. However, entities can apply these amendments as early as fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Regions is evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance regarding the classification and presentation of certain cash receipts and cash payments.  The guidance makes targeted improvements where current guidance is either unclear or silent in order to reduce areas where diversity in practice exists with respect to classification within the statement of cash flows.  Specifically, clarification on classification and presentation of the following  cash receipts and payments is addressed:  (a) cash payments made  
  
   59 

Table of Contents     

in connection with settling a debt arrangement before its maturity date and related debt extinguishment costs; (b) cash payments made at maturity of a zero-coupon debt instrument; (c) cash payments made to settle a contingent consideration liability arising from a business combination that are not made within a relatively short time period after the acquisition date; (d) cash proceeds received from the settlement of  insurance claims, including lump-sum settlements; (e) cash proceeds received from the settlement of corporate-owned or bank-owned life insurance policies, as well as premiums paid on these policies; (f) distributions received from equity method investees not accounted for under the fair value option and; (g) treatment of a transferor s beneficial interest obtained in a financial asset securitization.  The guidance also clarifies the application of the predominance principle when cash receipts or payments have separately identifiable cash flows. The guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis, unless impracticable, for periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period, given all amendments are adopted in the same period.  Regions is evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
   
  INTRODUCTION 
  The following discussion and analysis is part of Regions Financial Corporation s ( Regions  or the  Company ) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the SEC and updates Regions  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was previously filed with the SEC. This financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions  financial position and results of operations and should be read together with the financial information contained in the Form 10-K. Certain other prior period amounts presented in this discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications, except as otherwise noted. The emphasis of this discussion will be on the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   for the consolidated statements of income. For the consolidated balance sheets, the emphasis of this discussion will be the balances as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015  . 
  This discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered  forward-looking statements  as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See pages 5 through 7 for additional information regarding forward-looking statements. 
   
  CORPORATE PROFILE 
  Regions is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, which operates in the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, insurance, trust services, merger and acquisition advisory services and other specialty financing. 
  Regions conducts its banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama state-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. At   September 30, 2016  , Regions operated 1,597 total branch outlets across the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions operates under three reportable business segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management with the remainder split between Discontinued Operations and Other. See Note 13  Business Segment Information  to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Regions  segment reporting structure. Regions also provides full-line insurance brokerage services primarily through Regions Insurance, Inc., which is included in the Wealth Management segment. 
  On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James. The sale closed on April 2, 2012. Regions Investment Management, Inc. and Regions Trust were not included in the sale; they are included in the Wealth Management segment. See Note 2  Discontinued Operations  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
  Regions  profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and other financing income as well as non-interest income sources. Net interest income and other financing income  is primarily the difference between the interest income Regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions  net interest income and other financing income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Net interest income and other financing income also includes rental income and depreciation expense associated with operating leases for which Regions is the lessor. Non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and ATM fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, insurance activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes. 
  Economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions  market areas. 
  Regions  business strategy has been and continues to be focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service and maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations. 
  Recent Acquisitions 
  On October 17, 2016, Regions announced the acquisition of the low income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management businesses of First Sterling Financial, Inc., which is one of the leading national syndicators of investment funds benefiting from low income housing tax credits.  The acquisition complements Regions' existing low income housing tax credit origination business and further expands the Company's capabilities to serve more clients and communities.

THIRD QUARTER OVERVIEW 
  Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of   $304 million  , or   $0.24   per diluted share, in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $242 million  , or   $0.18   per diluted share, in the   third quarter   of   2015  . Net income available to common shareholders from continuing operations was   $303 million  , or   $0.24   per diluted share, compared to   $246 million  , or   $0.19   per diluted share, over these same periods. Net interest income and other financing income remained relatively flat period over period.  Non-interest income increased in the third quarter of 2016, but was partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. 
  For the   third quarter   of   2016  , net interest income and other financing income (taxable-equivalent basis) from continuing operations totaled   $856 million  , up $1 million compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  . The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was   3.06 percent   for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   3.13 percent   in the   third quarter   of   2015  . The average balance of total earning assets increased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015, while the related yields decreased for the comparable quarters. The average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities increased period over period primarily due to an increase in long-term borrowings.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average interest bearing deposits, all of which resulted in an increase in total funding costs from 25 to   30   basis points for the third quarter of 2016. 
  The provision for loan losses totaled   $29 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $60 million   during the   third quarter   of   2015  . The decrease is attributable to a reduction in loans outstanding and credit quality improvements in the energy portfolio. Given the current phase of the credit cycle, volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected, especially related to large dollar commercial credits and fluctuating commodity prices. 
  Net charge-offs totaled   $54 million  , or an annualized   0.26 percent   of average loans, in the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared to $60 million, or an annualized 0.30 percent for the   third quarter   of   2015  . Commercial and industrial loan net charge-offs decreased, while total consumer net charge-offs increased slightly, when comparing the third quarter of 2016 to the prior year.  See Note 4 "Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  The allowance for loan losses at   September 30, 2016  , was   1.39 percent   of total loans, net of unearned income, compared to 1.36 percent at   December 31, 2015  . Total non-performing assets were   $1.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $920 million   at   December 31, 2015  . While the overall credit quality of the energy portfolio has improved with energy prices beginning to stabilize, this increase was driven primarily by a select few large energy and energy-related loans. 
  Non-interest income from continuing operations was   $599 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to $497 million for the   third quarter   of    2015  . This increase was primarily driven by $47 million of insurance proceeds that were received in the third quarter of 2016, a recovery of $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, increases in card and ATM fees, and an increase in capital markets fee income and other. See Table 21 "Non-Interest Income from Continuing Operations" for more detail. 
  Total non-interest expense from continuing operations was   $934 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , a   $39 million   increase from the   third quarter   of   2015  . The increase was driven by an additional work day, an increase in incentives related to capital markets income growth, a $14 million charge related to the early extinguishment of debt , and expenses related to VISA class B shares that were sold in a prior year.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments related to additional assessments incurred during the third quarter of 2015 for prior period assessment adjustments. See Table 22 "Non-Interest Expense from Continuing Operations" for more detail. 
  Income tax expense from continuing operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $152 million   compared to income tax expense of   $116 million   for the same period in   2015  . See "Income Taxes" toward the end of the Management s Discussion and Analysis section of this report for more detail. 
  A discussion of activity within discontinued operations is included at the end of the Management s Discussion and Analysis section of this report. 
  2016 Expectations 
  Management expectations for 2016 are noted below: 
             
    Average loan growth relatively stable compared to fourth quarter of 2015 average balances; change from previous guidance expecting growth of 3 to 5 percent and tracking to the lower end of the range.  Change in guidance results from several factors including a decrease in average direct energy loans,  a continued strategy to limit exposure with regard to investor real estate loans, loan growth being impacted by continued softness in demand for middle market commercial and small business loans, management of concentration risk limits, and a continued focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. 
                
    Average deposits relatively stable compared to fourth quarter of 2015 average balances   
                
    Net interest income and other financing income up 2 to 4 percent  
     
   62 

Table of Contents     

Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) growth of more than 6 percent; change from previous guidance of up 4 to 6 percent on a full year basis, and expectation to be at the high end of the range resulting from fee-based revenue strategic initiatives exceeding expectations 
                 
    Adjusted non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) flat to up modestly on a full year basis 
                
    Full year adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) of approximately 63 percent; change from the previous guidance of less than 63 percent  
                
    Positive adjusted operating leverage (non-GAAP) of 2 to 4 percent on a full year basis 
                
    Full year net charge-offs of   25   to   35   basis points 
     The reconciliation with respect to these forward-looking non-GAAP measures is expected to be consistent with the actual non-GAAP reconciliations within Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-Q.  For more information related to the Company's 2016 expectations, including additional guidance within the ranges disclosed above, refer to the related sub-sections discussed in more detail within Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-Q. 
   
  BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 
  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
  Cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $1.1 billion from year-end 2015 to   September 30, 2016  , due primarily to a decrease in interest-bearing deposits in other banks as a result of normal day-to-day operating variations. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash and due from banks. 
   
  SECURITIES 
  The following table details the carrying values of securities, including both available for sale and held to maturity: 
  Table 1 Securities 

Regions maintains a highly rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency mortgage-backed securities. Total securities at   September 30, 2016   increased slightly from year-end   2015  . See Note 3 "Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  Securities available for sale, which constitute the majority of the securities portfolio, are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the Company. See the "Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk" and "Liquidity Risk" sections for more information.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE 
  Loans held for sale totaled   $571 million   at   September 30, 2016  , consisting primarily of $460 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $96 million of commercial mortgage loans and   $15 million   of non-performing loans. At   December 31, 2015  , loans held for sale totaled   $448 million  , consisting of $354 million of residential real estate mortgage loans, $56 million of commercial mortgage loans, and $38 million of non-performing loans. The level of residential real estate mortgage loans held for sale that are part of the Company's mortgage originations to be sold in the secondary market fluctuates depending on the timing of origination and sale to third parties. 
   
  LOANS 
  Loans, net of unearned income, represented approximately 73 percent of Regions  interest-earning assets at   September 30, 2016  . The following table presents the distribution of Regions  loan portfolio by portfolio segment and class, net of unearned income: 
  Table 2 Loan Portfolio 

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS 
  The following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and classes disclosed in Table 2, explain changes in balances from 2015 year-end, and highlight the related risk characteristics. Regions believes that its loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout its footprint. However, the loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note 4  Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 
  Commercial 
  The commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases and other expansion projects. Commercial and industrial loans   decreased     $433 million   since year-end 2015 driven primarily by declines in direct energy loans, softness in demand for middle market commercial small business loans, management of concentration risk limits, and a continued focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Commercial also includes owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans to operating businesses, which are loans for long-term financing of land and buildings, and are repaid by cash flow generated by business operations. These loans   declined     $531 million   from year-end   2015   as a result of continued customer deleveraging. Owner-occupied commercial real estate construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower.  
  Over half of the Company s total loans are included in the commercial portfolio segment. These balances are spread across numerous industries, as noted in the table below. The Company manages the related risks to this portfolio by setting certain lending limits for each significant industry. No single industry exceeded 15 percent of the total commercial portfolio balance at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

    Regions' definition of indirect energy-related lending includes certain balances within each of these selected industry categories. As of September 30, 2016, total indirect energy-related loans were approximately $514 million, with approximately $483 million included in commercial loans and $31 million in investor real estate loans. Total unfunded commitments for indirect energy-related lending were $432 million as of September 30, 2016. 
              (2) 
    As customers' businesses evolve (e.g. up or down the vertical manufacturing chain), Regions may need to change the assigned business industry code used to define the customer relationship. When these changes occur, Regions does not recast the customer history for prior periods into the new classification because the business industry code used in the prior period was deemed appropriate. As a result, year over year changes may be impacted. 
              (3) 
    Regions' definition of indirect energy-related lending includes certain balances within each of these selected industry categories. As of December 31, 2015, total indirect energy-related loans were approximately $519 million, with approximately $497 million included in commercial loans and $22 million in investor real estate loans. Total unfunded commitments for indirect energy-related lending were $446 million as of December 31, 2015. 
     Regions continues to monitor the impacts of low oil prices on both its direct and indirect energy lending portfolios. Regions  direct energy loan balances at   September 30, 2016   amounted to approximately   $2.2 billion  , consisting of loans such as oilfield services, exploration and production, and pipeline transportation of gas and crude oil. Other types of lending are tangentially impacted by the energy portfolio, such as petroleum wholesalers, oil and gas equipment manufacturing, air transportation, and petroleum bulk stations and terminals. These indirect energy loan balances were approximately $514 million at   September 30, 2016  . The entire energy-related portfolio, combining direct and indirect loans, was approximately $2.8 billion or 3 percent of total loans at   September 30, 2016  . Regions also has $145 million of energy-related operating leases.  
  Regions  energy-related portfolio is geographically concentrated primarily in Texas and, to a lesser extent, in South Louisiana. Regions employs a variety of risk management strategies, including the use of concentration limits and continuous monitoring, as well as utilizing underwriting with borrowing base structures tied to energy commodity reserve bases or other tangible assets. Additionally, heightened credit requirements have been adopted for select segments of the portfolio. Regions also employs experienced lending and underwriting teams including petroleum engineers, all with extensive energy sector experience through multiple economic cycles. Given the recent volatility in oil prices, this energy-related portfolio may be subject to additional pressure on credit quality metrics including past due, criticized, and non-performing loans, as well as net charge-offs. Regions' energy-related portfolio consists of a relatively small number of customers, which provides the Company granular insight into the financial health of those borrowers. Through its on-going portfolio credit quality assessment, Regions will continue to assess the impact to the allowance for loan losses and make adjustments as appropriate. 
  Investor Real Estate 
  Loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. This portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral. A portion of Regions  investor real estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by residential product types (land, single-family and condominium loans) within Regions  markets. Additionally, this category includes loans made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers. Total investor real estate loans   decreased     $183 million   from   2015   year-end balances.  
  Due to the nature of the cash flows typically used to repay investor real estate loans, these loans are particularly vulnerable to weak economic conditions. As a result, this loan type has a higher risk of non-collection than other loans. 
  Residential First Mortgage 
  Residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. These loans experienced a   $591 million     increase   from year-end   2015  , as prepayments have slowed. Approximately   $2.4 billion   in new loan originations were retained on the balance sheet through the   first nine months of 2016  .

Home Equity 
  Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. The home equity portfolio totaled   $10.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to $11.0 billion at   December 31, 2015  . Substantially all of this portfolio was originated through Regions  branch network.  
  The following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the Company's home equity lines of credit as of   September 30, 2016  . The balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period. 
  Table 4 Home Equity Lines of Credit - Future Principal Payment Resets   

  Of the   $10.7 billion   home equity portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $7.4 billion   were home equity lines of credit and $3.3 billion were closed-end home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). Beginning in May 2009, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment period. Previously, the home equity lines of credit had a 20-year term with a balloon payment upon maturity or a 5-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. The term  balloon payment  means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of Regions' home equity lines of credit have converted to mandatory amortization under the contractual terms. As presented in the table above, the majority of home equity lines of credit will either mature with a balloon payment or convert to amortizing status after fiscal year 2020. 
   
  Other Consumer Credit Quality Data 
  The Company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products ( current LTV ). The estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party. The third party data indicates trends for MSAs. Regions uses the third party valuation trends from the MSAs in the Company's footprint in its estimate. The trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area. 
  The following table presents current LTV data for components of the residential first mortgage and home equity classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current LTV data for the remaining loans in the portfolio is not available, primarily because some of the loans are serviced by others. Data may also not be available due to mergers and systems integrations. The amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. For purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral,     the entire balance is included in the  Above 100%  category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall. The balances in the  Above 100%  category as a percentage of the portfolio balances declined to   1 percent   in the residential first mortgage portfolio and to   3 percent   in the home equity portfolio at   September 30, 2016  .

Table 5 Estimated Current Loan to Value Ranges 

Indirect Vehicles 
  Indirect-vehicles lending, which is lending initiated through third-party business partners, largely consists of loans made through automotive dealerships. This portfolio class   increased     $92 million   from year-end   2015  . 
  Indirect Other Consumer 
  Indirect-other consumer lending represents other point of sale lending through third parties. This portfolio class increased $293 million from year-end 2015 primarily due to new point of sale initiatives. 
  Consumer Credit Card 
  Consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans. These balances   increased     $48 million   from year-end   2015  . 
  Other Consumer 
  Other consumer loans primarily include direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. Other consumer loans   increased     $147 million   from year-end   2015  . 
  Regions qualitatively considers factors such as periodic updates of FICO scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for consumer loans. FICO scores are obtained at origination as part of Regions' formal underwriting process. Refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company quarterly for all revolving accounts and home equity lines of credit and semi-annually for all other consumer loans. Residential first mortgage FICO scores are refreshed semiannually. The following tables present estimated current FICO score data for components of classes of the consumer portfolio segment. Current FICO data is not available for the remaining loans in the portfolio for various reasons; for example, if customers do not use sufficient credit, an updated score may not be available. Residential first mortgage and home equity balances with FICO scores below 620 were   6 percent   of the combined portfolios for both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
  The allowance for credit losses ( allowance ) consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. The allowance represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of period end. Regions determines its allowance in accordance with applicable accounting literature as well as regulatory guidance related to receivables and contingencies. Binding unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. Additional discussion of the methodology used to calculate the allowance is included in Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and Note 6  Allowance for Credit Losses  to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as well as related discussion in Management s Discussion and Analysis. 
  The allowance for loan losses totaled   $1.1 billion   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of net loans increased from 1.36 percent at   December 31, 2015   to   1.39   percent at   September 30, 2016  . The increase in the percentage is primarily attributable to the migration of energy loans, resulting in an increase in energy related allowance for loan losses. Total allowance for loan losses for the direct energy portfolio was approximately 8 percent at September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 6 percent at year-end 2015.  
  Management expects that net loan charge-offs will be in the   0.25   percent to   0.35   percent range for the   2016   year. Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility during the remainder of   2016  .  
  The provision for loan losses increased for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. During the   first nine months of 2016  , the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge-offs by approximately   $20 million  . The increase in loan loss provision reflects an increase in the allowance for loan losses for energy-related loans.  
  Management considers the current level of the allowance appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and credit commitment portfolios. Management s determination of the appropriateness of the allowance requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future. Changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. Management expects the allowance for credit losses to total loans ratio to vary over time due to changes in portfolio balances, economic conditions, loan mix and collateral values, or variations in other factors that may affect inherent losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the level of the allowance based on their judgments and estimates. Management attributes portions of the allowance to loans that it evaluates and determines to be impaired and to groups of loans that it evaluates collectively. However, the entire allowance is available to cover all charge-offs that arise from the loan portfolio. 
  Given the current phase of the credit cycle, volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits or certain portfolios may result in volatility. 
  Details regarding the allowance and net charge-offs, including an analysis of activity from the previous year s totals, are included in Table 7  Allowance for Credit Losses.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) 
  TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Residential first mortgage, home equity, indirect-vehicles, consumer credit card and other consumer TDRs are consumer loans modified under the CAP. Commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal program, but represent situations where a modification was offered as a workout alternative. Renewals of classified commercial and investor real estate loans are considered to be TDRs, even if no reduction in interest rate is offered, if the existing terms are considered to be below market. More detailed information is included in Note 4 "Loans and the Allowance For Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the loan balance and related allowance for accruing and non-accruing TDRs for the periods presented: 
  Table 8 Troubled Debt Restructurings    

_________ 
  Note: All loans listed in the table above are considered impaired under applicable accounting literature.  
   
  The following table provides an analysis of the changes in commercial and investor real estate TDRs. TDRs with subsequent restructurings that meet the definition of a TDR are only reported as TDR inflows in the period they were first modified. Other than resolutions such as charge-offs, foreclosures, payments, sales and transfers to held for sale, Regions may remove loans from TDR classification, if the borrower's financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualifies as a new loan. 
  For the consumer portfolio, changes in TDRs are primarily due to inflows from CAP modifications and outflows from payments and charge-offs. Given the types of concessions currently being granted under the CAP, as detailed in Note 4  Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses  to the consolidated financial statements, Regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition will be widely achieved. Therefore, Regions expects consumer loans modified through CAP to continue to be identified as TDRs for the remaining term of the loan.

(1) The majority of this category consists of payments and sales. "Other" outflows include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans transferred to held for sale. It also includes $31 million of commercial loans and $7 million of investor real estate loans refinanced or restructured as new loans and removed from TDR classification for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , $36 million of commercial loans and $48 million of investor real estate loans were refinanced or restructured as new loans and removed from TDR classification.

NON-PERFORMING ASSETS 
  Non-performing assets are summarized as follows: 
  Table 10 Non-Performing Assets 

_________ 
           (1) 
    Excludes accruing loans 90 days past due. 
              (2) 
    Excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the FHA and all guaranteed loans sold to the GNMA where Regions has the right but not the obligation to repurchase. Total 90 days or more past due guaranteed loans excluded were   $99 million   at   September 30, 2016   and $107 million at   December 31, 2015  .  
     Non-performing loans have increased during 2016 primarily as a result of pressure on the energy lending portfolio as discussed in the "Portfolio Characteristics" section. Economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations will impact the future level of non-performing assets. Circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility throughout   2016  . 
   
  Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, excluding government guaranteed loans, were   $178 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease from   $213 million   at   December 31, 2015  .

At   September 30, 2016  , Regions had approximately $200 million to $275 million of potential problem commercial and investor real estate loans that were not included in non-accrual loans, but for which management had concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms. This is a likely estimate of the amount of commercial and investor real estate loans that have the potential to migrate to non-accrual status in the next quarter. 
  In order to arrive at the estimate of potential problem loans, personnel from geographic regions forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be downgraded to non-accrual at a future time, depending on the occurrence of future events. These personnel consider a variety of factors, including the borrower s capacity and willingness to meet the contractual repayment terms, make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary, and provide current and complete financial information including global cash flows, contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity. Based upon the consideration of these factors, a probability weighting is assigned to loans to reflect the potential for migration to the pool of potential problem loans during this specific time period. Additionally, for other loans (for example, smaller dollar loans), a trend analysis is incorporated to determine the estimate of potential future downgrades. Because of the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future events, the estimate of potential problem loans ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans as opposed to an individual listing of loans. 
  The majority of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is based are considered criticized and classified. Detailed disclosures for substandard accrual loans (as well as other credit quality metrics) are included in Note 4  Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses  to the consolidated financial statements. 
  The following table provides an analysis of non-accrual loans (excluding loans held for sale) by portfolio segment:

    Includes charge-offs on loans on non-accrual status and charge-offs taken upon sale and transfer of non-accrual loans to held for sale. 
       
  GOODWILL 
  Goodwill totaled   $4.9 billion   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and is allocated to each of Regions  reportable segments (each a reporting unit), at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value (refer to Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to the   2015   consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for further discussion of when Regions tests goodwill for impairment and the Company's methodology and valuation approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit).  
  The result of the assessment performed for the third quarter of 2016 did not indicate that the estimated fair values of the Company s reporting units (Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management) had declined below their respective carrying values. Therefore, Regions determined that a test of goodwill impairment was not required for each of Regions  reporting units for the September 30, 2016 interim period.

DEPOSITS 
  Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions  ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the Company meets customers  needs. Regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. Regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as internet banking. 
  The following table summarizes deposits by category: 
  Table 12 Deposits 

Total deposits at   September 30, 2016   increased approximately   $859 million   compared to year-end   2015   levels. The increase was driven by growth in non-interest-bearing demand and money market domestic accounts. These increases were partially offset by a continued decline in interest-bearing transaction accounts as a result of certain trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, continuing to shift out of deposits and into other fee income-producing customer investments.

LONG-TERM BORROWINGS 
  Table 14 Long-Term Borrowings 

Long-term borrowings   decreased   approximately   $2.3 billion   since year-end   2015  . The decrease was primarily the result of a $2.8 billion decrease in the FHLB advances and the repurchase, through a tender offer, of approximately $649 million of the outstanding 2.00% senior notes due May 2018. Pre-tax losses on the repurchase related to the execution of this tender offer were approximately $14 million. Offsetting these decreases was the issuance of $1.1 billion of 3.20% senior notes.  Regions issued $500 million of 3.20% senior notes in the first quarter of 2016 and an additional $600 million of 3.20% senior notes during the second quarter of 2016. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted new FASB guidance related to the accounting for debt issuance costs. All existing debt issuance costs were reclassified from other assets to long-term borrowings as direct deductions of the related debt instruments. The impact of the adoption of this guidance was not material to prior periods and therefore was not applied retrospectively.  
  Long-term FHLB advances have a weighted-average interest rate of 1.0 percent for   September 30, 2016   and 0.7 percent for   December 31, 2015   with remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to fourteen years and a weighted-average of 0.9 years. 
   
  STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 
  Stockholders  equity was   $17.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $16.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . During the first nine months of 2016, net income increased stockholders  equity by   $868 million  , while cash dividends on common stock reduced stockholders' equity by   $240 million   and cash dividends on preferred stock reduced stockholder's equity by   $48 million  . Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders' equity by   $485 million  , primarily due to the net change in the value of securities available for sale and derivative instruments. Common stock repurchased during the first nine months of 2016 reduced stockholders' equity by   $569 million  . These shares were immediately retired and therefore are not included in treasury stock. 
  On June 29, 2016, Regions received no objection from the Federal Reserve to its 2016 capital plan that was submitted as part of the CCAR process. In addition to continuing the $0.065 quarterly common stock dividend, actions that Regions may undertake as outlined in its capital plan include the repurchase of up to $640 million in common shares. The capital plan also provides the potential for a dividend increase beginning in the second quarter of 2017, which is expected to be considered by the Board in early 2017.

Table of Contents     

On July 14, 2016, Regions' Board authorized a new   $640 million   common stock repurchase plan, permitting repurchases from the beginning of the third quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017.  As of September 30, 2016, Regions had repurchased approximately 23.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $215 million under this plan. On October 12, 2016, Regions' Board authorized an additional $120 million repurchase, which increases the total amount authorized under the plan to $760 million. The Company continued to repurchase shares under this plan in the fourth quarter of 2016, and as of November 3, 2016, Regions had additional repurchases of approximately 10.9 million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $116.7 million. All of these shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and, therefore, will not be included in treasury stock. 
  Regions  Board declared a cash dividend for the second and third quarters of 2016 of   $0.065   per common share and $0.06 per common share for the first quarter of 2016. The Board declared a $0.05 per share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2015 and $0.06 per share cash dividend for the second and third quarters of 2015. The Board also declared   $48 million   in cash dividends on preferred stock for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015. Prior to the first quarter of 2016, the Company was in a retained deficit position and common stock dividends were recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital, while preferred dividends were recorded as a reduction of preferred stock, including related surplus. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company achieved positive retained earnings and both common stock and preferred dividends were recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. 
  See Note 7  Stockholders  Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)  for additional information. 
   
  REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
  CAPITAL RULES  
  Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by federal and state banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions.  
  In 2013, the Federal Reserve released its final rules detailing the U.S. implementation of the Basel III Rules. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank and, as such, began transitioning to the Basel III Rules in January 2015 subject to a phase-in period extending to January 2019. When fully phased in, the Basel III Rules will increase capital requirements through higher minimum capital levels as well as through increases in risk-weights for certain exposures. Additionally, the Basel III Rules place greater emphasis on common equity. The Basel III Rules substantially revise the regulatory capital requirements applicable to BHCs and depository institutions, including Regions and Regions Bank. The Basel III Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios to incorporate a more risk-sensitive approach. The Basel III Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies' rules.  
  The Basel III Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a measure called CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and  Additional Tier 1 capital  instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to prior regulations. 
  Under the Basel III Rules, the initial minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 were as follows: 
              
    6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. 
                
    8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets. 
     The Basel III Rules also introduce a new capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. In addition, the Basel III Rules provide for a countercyclical capital buffer applicable only to advanced approach institutions. Currently the countercyclical capital buffer is not applicable to Regions or Regions Bank. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer (where applicable) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.  
  When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Rules will require Regions and Regions Bank to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1 to risk-weighted assets, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.  
  The Basel III Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. For example, goodwill and certain other intangible assets, as well as certain deferred tax assets are deducted. MSRs, certain other deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are also deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Under the Basel III Rules, the effects of certain  
  
   78 

Table of Contents     

accumulated other comprehensive items are included; however, standardized approach banking organizations, including Regions and Regions Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to exclude these items. Regions and Regions Bank made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities portfolios. 
  Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased in over a 4- year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a remaining 3-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).  
  With respect to Regions Bank, the Basel III Rules also revise the prompt corrective action regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the required Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the previous 6%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Basel III Rules do not change the total capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.  
  The Basel III Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expands the risk-weighting categories from the previous four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 1,250% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Specific changes to the prior capital rules impacting Regions' determination of risk-weighted assets include, among other things: 
             
    Applying a 150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction exposures (previously set at 100%). 
                
    Assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are on non-accrual status or 90 days or more past due (previously set at 100%). 
                
    Providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a loan commitment with an original maturity of less than one year that is not unconditionally cancellable (previously set at 0%).  
                
    Eliminating the previous 50% cap on the risk weight for derivative exposures. 
                
    Replacing the previous Ratings Based Approach for certain asset-backed securities with a SSFA, which results in risk weights ranging from 20% to 1,250% (previously ranged from 100% to 1,250%). 
                
    Effective January 1, 2018, applying a 250% risk weight to the portion of MSRs and certain deferred tax assets that are includible in capital (previously set at 100%). 
     In addition, the Basel III Rules also provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.

LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO 
  The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC approved a final rule in 2014 implementing a minimum LCR requirement for certain large BHCs, savings and loan holding companies and depository institutions, and a less stringent LCR requirement (the "modified LCR") for other banking organizations, such as Regions, with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The final rule imposes a monthly calculation requirement. In January 2016, the minimum phased-in LCR requirement was 90 percent, to be followed by 100 percent in January 2017. The regulatory agencies have released an NPR that would require public disclosures of certain LCR measures beginning in 2018. The comment period for this NPR ended in February 2016.  
  At September 30, 2016, the Company was fully compliant with the LCR requirements. However, should the Company's cash position or investment mix change in the future, the Company's ability to meet the LCR requirement may be impacted, and additional funding would need to be sourced to remain compliant.

  N/A - Not applicable. 
  On October 4, 2016, Fitch revised the outlook for Regions Financial Corporation to Positive from Stable, reflecting the Company s capital and liquidity profile, improving earnings, and continued improvement in asset quality. 
  On November 2, 2016, Moody's upgraded the senior unsecured and subordinated debt ratings of Regions Financial Corporation to Baa2.  Further, Moody s upgraded Regions Bank's long-term deposits rating to A2 and its senior unsecured and subordinated debt ratings to Baa2.  Following the upgrade the outlook for the Company is Stable.  The upgrade is reflective of the Company's continued improvement in asset quality, sensitivity to asset concentrations in its loan portfolio, reduction in direct-energy loan exposure, and strong capital and liquidity profile. 
  In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of earnings. Any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact Regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, Regions  access to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity, collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting Regions  financial condition and liquidity. See the  Risk Factors  section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for more information. 
  A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

NON-GAAP MEASURES 
  The table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures, which exclude certain significant items that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include  adjusted fee income ratio,   adjusted efficiency ratio,   return on average tangible common stockholders  equity,  average and end of period  tangible common stockholders  equity,  and  Basel III CET1, on a fully phased-in basis  and related ratios. Regions believes that expressing earnings and certain other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions  business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Management and the Board utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 
             
    Preparation of Regions  operating budgets 
                
    Monthly financial performance reporting 
                
    Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only) 
                
    Presentations to investors of Company performance 
     The adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity, is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest expense divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. The adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) is generally calculated as adjusted non-interest income divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses these ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted efficiency and adjusted fee income ratios.  
  Tangible common stockholders  equity ratios have become a focus of some investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank s capital adequacy based on Tier 1 capital, the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions  capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders  equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders  equity is not formally defined by GAAP, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions  disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions  capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders  equity, Regions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions  capital adequacy on this same basis. 
  The Basel Committee's Basel III framework will strengthen international capital and liquidity regulations. When fully phased-in, Basel III will increase capital requirements through higher minimum capital levels as well as through increases in risk-weights for certain exposures. Additionally, the Basel III Rules place greater emphasis on common equity. The Federal Reserve released its final Basel III Rules detailing the U.S. implementation of Basel III in 2013. Regions, as a standardized approach bank, began transitioning to the Basel III framework in January 2015 subject to a phase-in period extending through January 2019. Because the Basel III implementation regulations will not be fully phased-in until 2019 and, are not formally defined by GAAP, these measures are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions  capital adequacy using the fully phased-in Basel III framework, Regions believes that it is useful to provide investors information enabling them to assess Regions  capital adequacy on the same basis. 
  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders. 
   
  The following table provides: 1) a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to net income available to common shareholders (GAAP), 2) a reconciliation of non-interest expense from continuing operations (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), 3) a reconciliation of non-interest income from continuing operations (GAAP) to adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), 4) a computation of adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP), 5) a computation of the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), 6) a computation of the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP), 7) a reconciliation of average and ending stockholders  equity (GAAP) to average and ending tangible common stockholders  equity (non-GAAP) and calculations of related ratios (non-GAAP), 8) a reconciliation of stockholders  equity (GAAP) to Basel III CET1, on a fully phased-in basis (non-GAAP), and calculation of the related ratio based on Regions  current understanding of the Basel III requirements (non-GAAP).

third quarter   of   2016   and   3.13   percent for the   third quarter   of 2015. For the   first nine months of 2016   and   2015  , net interest income and other financing income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled   $2.6 billion   and   $2.5 billion  , respectively. The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was   3.13 percent   and 3.15 percent for the   first nine months of 2016   and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016, compared to the same periods of 2015, was primarily due to an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, reflecting a decline in low-cost short-term borrowings.  
  Management expects to increase net interest income and other financing income in the range of   2   percent to   4   percent in 2016 compared to 2015.  
   
  MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE RISK  
  Regions  primary market risk is interest rate risk. This includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the Company offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income and other financing income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income and other financing income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of Regions  interest rate risk. 
  Sensitivity Measurement   Financial simulation models are Regions  primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income and other financing income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions  balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that result from both strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior. 
  The primary objective of asset/liability management at Regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income and other financing income throughout various interest rate cycles. In computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement, Regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario based on  market forward rates.  The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus 100 and 200 basis points. While not presented, up-rate scenarios of greater magnitude are also analyzed. Regions prepares a minus 50 basis points scenario, as minus 100 and 200 basis points scenarios are of limited use in the current rate environment. In addition to parallel curve shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated.  Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements.   
  Exposure to Interest Rate Movements   As of   September 30, 2016  , Regions was moderately asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending September   2017  . The estimated exposure associated with the parallel yield curve shift of minus 50 basis points in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. The decline in short-term interest rates (such as the Fed Funds rate and the rate of Interest on Excess Reserves) will lead to a reduction of yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates. Because interest rates have been at low levels for such an extended period, it is expected that declines in deposit costs will only partially offset the decline in asset yields. A reduction in long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term U.S. Treasuries, swap and mortgage rates) will drive yields lower on certain fixed rate, newly originated or renewed loans, reduce prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and increase amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. 
  With respect to sensitivity to long-term interest rates, the balance sheet is estimated to be moderately asset sensitive. Current simulation models estimate that, as compared to the base case, net interest income and other financing income over a 12 month horizon would respond favorably by approximately $109 million if longer-term interest rates were to immediately and on a sustained basis exceed the base scenario by 100 basis points. Conversely, if longer-term interest rates were to immediately and on a sustained basis underperform the base case by 50 basis points, then net interest income and other financing income, as compared to the base case, would decline by approximately $65 million. These estimates may vary to the extent that long-term yield curve basis relationships change. The table below summarizes Regions' positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e. including both long-term and short-term interest rates). The scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities. 
  
   87 

Table of Contents     

Table 19 Interest Rate Sensitivity  

As discussed above, the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in Table 19 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the course of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. Though there are many assumptions that affect the estimates for net interest income and other financing income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. Given the uncertainties associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates, management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions. Sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results. 
  The Company s baseline balance sheet growth assumptions include continued moderate loan and deposit growth reflecting management's best estimate. The behavior of deposits in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles, but with suitable adjustments based on management s expectations in the current rate environment. In the + 200 basis point gradual interest rate change scenario in Table 19, the total cumulative interest bearing deposit re-pricing sensitivity is expected to be approximately 60 percent of changes in short-term market rates (e.g. Fed Funds), as compared to approximately 55 percent in the 2004 to 2007 historical timeframe. A 5 percentage point higher sensitivity than the 60 percent baseline would reduce 12 month net interest income and other financing income in the gradual +200 basis points scenario by approximately $56 million. While the estimates should be used as a guide, differences may result driven by the pace of rate changes, and other market and competitive factors.  
  Similarly, management assumes that the change in the mix of deposits in a rising rate environment versus the baseline balance sheet growth assumptions is informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. Management assumes that in rising rate scenarios, some shift from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing products will occur. The magnitude of the shift is rate dependent, but equates to approximately $3.5 billion over 12 months in the gradual +200 basis point scenario in Table 19. In the event this shift increased by an additional $3.0 billion over 12 months, the result would be a reduction of 12 month net interest income and other financing income in the gradual +200 basis points scenario by approximately $27 million. 
  Interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of Regions  securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of stockholders  equity. Regions from time to time may hedge these price movements with derivatives (as discussed below).  
   
  Derivatives   Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. ALCO, which consists of members of Regions  senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. The most common derivatives Regions employs are forward rate contracts, Eurodollar futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and forward sale commitments. Derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit and foreign exchange risks. 
  Forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. A Eurodollar futures contract is a future on a Eurodollar deposit. Eurodollar futures contracts subject Regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with Eurodollar futures. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the Company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position and available for sale securities portfolios to a variable-rate position and to effectively convert a portion of its variable-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. Regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing. 
  The following table presents additional information about the interest rate derivatives used by Regions to manage interest rate risk: 
  Table 20 Hedging Derivatives by Interest Rate Risk Management Strategy   

Regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. For non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. Credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. When there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. The majority of interest rate derivatives traded by Regions are subject to mandatory clearing. The counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing Regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. The  Credit Risk  section in Regions  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contains more information on the management of credit risk. 
  Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Other derivatives instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. Instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. 
  The primary objective of Regions  hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of Regions  execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. See Note 11  Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities  to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions  quarter-end derivatives positions and further discussion. 
  Regions accounts for residential MSRs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. Regions enters into derivative and balance sheet transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential MSRs. Derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of Regions  current portfolio.

MARKET RISK PREPAYMENT RISK  
  Regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments. Prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income and other financing income. For example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor, so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower rates. As loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment, Regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce Regions  interest income and overall asset yields. Conversely, in a rising rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. Prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. Regions  greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgage-backed securities portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the residential mortgage servicing asset, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements. Each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the U.S. Government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market. Such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors. The Company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. Further, Regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income on the residential mortgage servicing asset. Regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income and other financing income forecasting and interest rate risk management. In particular, because current interest rates are relatively low, Regions employs strategies to actively manage the potential exposure to declining prepayments that may occur in the loan and securities portfolio in the event of increasing market interest rates.  
   
  LIQUIDITY RISK 
  Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions  ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers. In 2014, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC released the final version of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio. The rule is designed to ensure that financial institutions have the necessary assets on hand to withstand short-term liquidity disruptions. See the "Liquidity Coverage Ratio" discussion included in the "Regulatory Requirements" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information. 
  Regions intends to fund its obligations primarily through cash generated from normal operations. In addition to these obligations, Regions has obligations related to potential litigation contingencies. See Note 14  Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Company s funding requirements. 
  Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer deposits, borrowed funds and stockholders  equity. Regions  goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting the Company s cash flow needs. Having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the Company s funding requirements is important. 
  In order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained, Regions performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at the bank, holding company, and affiliate levels. Regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. Compliance with the holding company cash requirements is reported to the Risk Committee of the Board on a quarterly basis. Regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the Bank and subsidiaries. The Bank's funding and contingency planning does not currently include any reliance on short-term unsecured sources. Risk limits are established within the Company's Liquidity Risk Oversight Committee and ALCO, which regularly reviews compliance with the established limits.  
  The securities portfolio is one of Regions  primary sources of liquidity. Proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see Note 3  Securities  to the consolidated financial statements). The agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured borrowing capacities. 
  Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds. Additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one-to-four family residential first mortgage loans. Regions  liquidity is further enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base. Liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets, although Regions does not currently rely on short-term unsecured wholesale market funding. 
   The balance with the FRB is the primary component of the balance sheet line item,  interest-bearing deposits in other banks.  At   September 30, 2016  , Regions had approximately   $2.3 billion   in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve, a decrease from approximately $3.9 billion at December 31, 2015. 
  Regions  borrowing availability with the FRB as of   September 30, 2016  , based on assets pledged as collateral on that date, was $14.7 billion. 
  Regions  financing arrangement with the FHLB adds additional flexibility in managing the Company's liquidity position. As of   September 30, 2016  , Regions  outstanding balance of FHLB borrowings was   $2.5 billion   and its total borrowing capacity  
  
   90 

Table of Contents     

from the FHLB totaled $12.5 billion. FHLB borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. Regions Bank pledged certain securities and residential first mortgage loans on one-to-four family dwellings and home equity lines of credit as collateral for the FHLB advances outstanding. Additionally, investment in FHLB stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding. 
  Regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that can be utilized by Regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. Regions may also issue bank notes from time to time, either as part of a bank note program or as stand-alone issuances. Refer to Note 13 "Long-Term Borrowings" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. Regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. 
   
  CREDIT RISK 
  Regions  objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a high-quality credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. Regions has a diversified loan portfolio in terms of product type, collateral and geography. See Table 2 for further details of each loan portfolio segment. See the  Portfolio Characteristics  section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type. 
   
  INFORMATION SECURITY RISK 
  Operational risks comprise several elements, including information security risks. Information security risks such as evolving and adaptive cyber-attacks, regularly conducted against Regions and other large financial institutions to compromise or disable information systems, have generally increased in recent years. This trend is expected to continue in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of mobile devices, more financial transactions conducted online, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees. 
  Regions spends significant resources to identify and mitigate threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its information systems. Regions regularly assesses the threats and vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems and controls to effectively mitigate these risks. Layered security controls   are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and transactions.   Regions will continue to commit the resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks, as well as continue to develop and enhance controls, processes and technology to protect its systems from attacks or unauthorized access. In addition, Regions maintains a strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program to include oversight of third-party relationships involving vendors. The Board, through its various committees, is briefed at least quarterly on information security matters. 
  Regions participates in information sharing organizations such as FS-ISAC to gather and share information amongst peer banks to better prepare and protect systems from attack.   FS-ISAC is a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services sector against cyber and physical threats and risk. It acts as a trusted third party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat, vulnerability and incident information in a non-attributable and trusted manner so information that would normally not be shared is instead provided for the good of the membership. In addition to FS-ISAC, Regions is a member of BITS, the technology arm of the Financial Services Roundtable. BITS serves the financial community and its members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and fraud topics. 
  Regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation. These vendors have also continued to commit the necessary resources to support Regions in the event of an attack. Even though Regions devotes significant resources to combat cyber security risks, there is no guarantee that these measures will provide absolute security. As an additional security measure, Regions has placed a computer forensics firm and an industry-leading consulting firm on retainer in case of a breach event. 
  Even if Regions successfully prevents data breaches to its own networks, the Company may still incur losses that result from customers' account information obtained through breaches of retailers' networks where customers have transacted business. The fraud losses, as well as the costs of investigations and re-issuing new customer cards impact Regions' financial results. In addition, Regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of its business infrastructure, which may also increase information security risk. 
   
  REGULATORY RISK 
  In 2014, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta began a regularly scheduled CRA examination of Regions Bank covering 2012 and 2013 performance. This review included, among other things, a review of Regions Bank's previously disclosed public consent orders. As a result of the examination, the results of which were communicated during the fourth quarter of 2015, Regions Bank received "High Satisfactory" ratings on its CRA components, but its overall CRA rating was downgraded from "Satisfactory" to  Needs to Improve.  The downgrade was attributed to the matters underlying Regions Bank s April 2015 public consent order with the CFPB related to overdrafts and Regulation E. Regions Bank had self-reported these matters and provided remuneration to affected customers during 2011 and 2012. This downgrade imposes restrictions on the Company's ability to undertake certain  
  
   91 

Table of Contents     

activities, including mergers and acquisitions of insured depository institutions and applications to open branches or certain other facilities until such time as the rating is improved. Although Regions Bank's next CRA examination is currently in progress, any results therefrom, and the timing of such results, will not be known until later. 
   
  PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES 
  The provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that in management s judgment is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The provision for loan losses totaled   $29 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $60 million   during the   third quarter   of   2015  . The provision for loan losses totaled   $214 million   for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $172 million for the first nine months of 2015. Refer to the  Allowance for Credit Losses  section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail.

Table of Contents     

Service charges on deposit accounts   Service charges on deposit accounts include non-sufficient fund fees and other service charges. The decreases during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 were primarily due to the change in posting order of customer deposit transactions that went into effect during the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by growth in consumer checking accounts. 
  Card and ATM fees   Card and ATM fees include the combined amounts of credit card/bank card income and debit card and ATM related revenue. The increases in the   third quarter   and first nine months of   2016   compared to the same periods of   2015   were primarily the result of a continued increase of checking accounts, as well as increased transactions driven in part by the continued migration from cash and checks to cards. Additionally, continued increases in active credit cards generated greater purchase activity resulting in higher interchange income.  
  Mortgage income   Mortgage income increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 due to increased gains from loan sales partially offset by declines in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. In addition, mortgage servicing income has increased as a result of the first quarter 2016 purchase of the rights to service approximately   $2.6 billion   in residential mortgage loans.  
  Investment management and trust fee income   Investment management and trust fee income represents income from asset management services provided to individuals, businesses and institutions.  The increases in the   third quarter   and first nine months of   2016   compared to the same periods of   2015   were primarily the result of increases in assets under administration. 
  Insurance commissions and fees   Regions sells property and casualty, life and health, mortgage, and other specialty insurance and credit related products to businesses and individuals. Insurance commissions and fees remained flat in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. The increase in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 was partially due to additional revenue generated by the third quarter of 2015 acquisition of an insurance team that specializes in group employee benefits.  
  Capital markets fee income and other   Capital markets fee income and other primarily relates to capital raising activities that includes securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication and placement, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. The increase in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to mergers and acquisitions advisory fees, which the company began recognizing in the fourth quarter of 2015 in connection with the purchase of a middle-market advisory firm. The increase in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the purchase of the advisory firm, as well as increased loan syndication fees and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers.   
  Insurance proceeds   In the third quarter of 2016, the Company received $47 million of insurance proceeds related to a previously disclosed settlement with the Department of Justice on behalf of HUD regarding FHA insured mortgage loans. Expenses related to the settlement were accrued in prior periods. Insurance proceeds recognized in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015 were related to the settlement of the previously disclosed and accrued 2010 class-action lawsuit. 
  Bank-owned life insurance   Bank-owned life insurance increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to claims benefits as well as a gain on exchange of policies in the first quarter of 2016. 
  Securities gains, net   Net securities gains primarily result from the Company's asset/liability management process. Net securities gains for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 were lower because during the first quarter of 2016 the Company reduced its exposure to energy-related corporate bonds in an effort to mitigate the risk of future downgrades and incurred $5 million in losses related to these sales. See Note 3 "Securities" to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 
  Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets   Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 reflecting market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. These adjustments are offset in salaries and employee benefits expense. 
  Other miscellaneous income   Other miscellaneous income includes fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous fees. The increases in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 are primarily due to a recovery of approximately $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

Salaries and employee benefits   Salaries and employee benefits are comprised of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held for employee benefit purposes. Salaries and benefits increased for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The primary drivers of the increase were increased production-based incentives related to capital markets income growth and annual merit increases. Notably, staffing levels declined from 23,423 to 22,215 full-time equivalent positions from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016, serving to partially offset the aforementioned increases. Salaries and benefits also increased for the same reasons for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Additionally, severances charges of approximately   $16 million   were incurred in the first nine months of 2016 with no corresponding amounts in the same period in 2015. See Note 10 "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" for details of the net periodic pension costs that illustrate the decrease for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

On December 31, 2015, Regions changed the basis for determining the assumption used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic pension costs.  Additionally, Regions separated the Regions Financial Corporation Retirement Plan into two plans, effective January 1, 2016. Including the impact of these changes, Regions expects total net periodic pension costs to decrease by approximately $20 million to $25 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Refer to Note 18 "Employee Benefit Plans" to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for additional information. Refer also to Note 10 "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" for additional information. 
  Professional, legal and regulatory expenses   Professional, legal and regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory charges. Professional, legal and regulatory expenses increased during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to an increase in legal reserves. Professional, legal and regulatory expenses decreased during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of a net $48 million accrual for contingent legal and regulatory expenses in the second quarter of 2015, as well as a favorable legal settlement of $7 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
  FDIC insurance assessments   FDIC insurance assessments decreased during the   third quarter   and first nine months of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to $23 million of additional assessment expenses that were recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to prior assessments.  The surcharge imposed by the FDIC went into effect during the third quarter of 2016 and the expected expense levels are anticipated to be relatively consistent with the third quarter of 2016 level going forward.   
  Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges   Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges include valuation adjustments related to owned branches when the decision to close them is made. Accelerated depreciation and lease write-off charges for leased branches are recorded through the actual branch close date, while lease write-off charges are recorded at the actual branch close date. Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges also include costs related to occupancy optimization initiatives. 
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt    In the first quarter of 2015, Regions purchased approximately $250 million of its 7.50% subordinated notes due May 2018, incurring a related early extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $43 million.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company purchased approximately $649 million of its 2.00% senior notes due May 2018.  Pre-tax losses on the early extinguishment related to this tender offer were approximately $14 million.   
  Visa class B shares expense   Visa class B shares expense is associated with shares sold in a prior year. The Visa class B shares have restrictions tied to finalization of certain covered litigations. Visa class B shares expense increased during the   third quarter   and first nine months of   2016   compared to the same periods of   2015  . The current quarter expense and driver of the increase relates primarily to a Visa class action settlement that was overturned on appeal. 
  Other miscellaneous expenses   Other miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses and mortgage repurchase costs. Other miscellaneous expenses were flat during the   third quarter   of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Other miscellaneous expenses increased during the first nine months of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , primarily due to increased credit-related valuation charges associated with other real estate and loans held for sale. 
   
  INCOME TAXES 
  The Company s income tax expense from continuing operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $152 million   compared to income tax expense of   $116 million   for the same period in   2015  , resulting in effective tax rates of 32.3 percent and 30.7 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is higher than the prior comparable period principally due to the termination of certain leveraged leases in the current period.  
  Income tax expense from continuing operations for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $380 million   compared to income tax expense of   $335 million   for the same period in   2015  , resulting in effective tax rates of  30.6 percent and 29.9 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   is higher than the prior comparable period principally due to discrete tax benefits reported in the prior period, partially offset in the current period by increased tax benefits related principally to affordable housing investments and tax-exempt income. 
  The effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance and tax-exempt interest. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of $49 million compared to a net deferred tax asset of $254 million at   December 31, 2015  . The change is due principally to an increase in unrealized gains on securities available for sale and derivative instruments.

New accounting guidance related to accounting for share-based payments was issued in March 2016.  The guidance eliminates additional paid-in capital pools and designates that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies should be recorded in income tax expense or benefit when the awards vest or are settled.  As a result of adoption in 2017, Regions estimates an incremental increase to income tax expense of approximately $5 million in the second quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 related to expiring stock options. See Note 15 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for additional information. 
   
  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
  Morgan Keegan was sold on April 2, 2012. Regions' results from discontinued operations are presented in Note 2 "Discontinued Operations" to the consolidated financial statements. The   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   income from discontinued operations was primarily the result of recoveries of legal expenses.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  Information required by this item is set forth in Note 14,  Commitments,  Contingencies and Guarantees  in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I. Item 1. of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
   
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
  Information concerning Regions  repurchases of its outstanding common stock during the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , is set forth in the following table:  
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

On July 14, 2016, Regions' Board authorized a new   $640 million   common stock repurchase plan, permitting repurchases from the beginning of the third quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017. As of September 30, 2016, Regions repurchased approximately 23.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $215 million under this plan. The Company continued to repurchase shares under this plan in the fourth quarter of 2016, and as of November 3, 2016, Regions had additional repurchases of approximately 10.9 million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $116.7 million. All of these shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and, therefore, will not be included in treasury stock. 
  On October 12, 2016, Regions' Board authorized an additional $120 million repurchase, which increases the total amount authorized under the plan to $760 million. 
  Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchase of Stock 
  Holders of Regions common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as Regions  Board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Furthermore, holders of Regions common stock are subject to the prior dividend rights of the holders of Regions preferred stock then outstanding.  
  Regions understands the importance of returning capital to shareholders. Management will continue to execute the capital planning process, including evaluation of the amount of the common dividend, with the Board and in conjunction with the regulatory supervisors, subject to the Company s results of operations. Also, Regions is a BHC, and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. 
  On November 1, 2012, Regions completed the sale of 20 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of its 6.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $1.00 per share ( Series A Preferred Stock ), with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per depositary share). The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock prohibit Regions from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of its capital stock, including its common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or acquiring such junior stock, unless Regions has declared and paid full dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at Regions  option in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after December 15, 2017, or in whole, but not in part, at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event (as defined in the certificate of designations establishing the Series A Preferred Stock). 
  On April 29, 2014, Regions completed the sale of 20 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of its 6.375% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $1.00 per share ( Series B Preferred Stock ), with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per depositary share). The terms of the Series B Preferred Stock prohibit Regions from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of its capital stock, including its common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or acquiring such junior stock, unless Regions has declared and paid full dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. The Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable at Regions  option in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after September 15, 2024, or in whole but not in part, at any time following a regulatory capital treatment event (as defined in the certificate of designations establishing the Series B Preferred Stock).
