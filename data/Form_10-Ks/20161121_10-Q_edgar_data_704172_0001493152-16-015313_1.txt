    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

NOTE
1      NATURE OF BUSINESS   

PHI
Group, Inc. (the  Company  or  PHI ) is a Nevada corporation engaged in mergers and acquisitions as a
principal ( www.phiglobal.com ). The Company has adopted plans to acquire established operating businesses in selective industries
and invest in various ventures that may potentially create significant long-term value for our shareholders. In addition, we also
provide corporate finance services, including merger and acquisition advisory and consulting services for client companies through
our wholly owned subsidiary PHI Capital Holdings, Inc. ( www.phicapitalholdings.com ). No assurances can be made that the
Company will be successful in achieving its plans.  

Originally
incorporated in June 1982 as JR Consulting, Inc., the Company was foremost engaged in mergers and acquisitions and had an operating
subsidiary, Diva Entertainment, Inc., which operated two modeling agencies, one in New York and one in California. Following the
business combination with Providential Securities, Inc., a California-based brokerage firm, in late 1999, the Company changed
its name to Providential Securities, Inc. (Nevada) in January 2000. The Company then changed its name to Providential Holdings,
Inc. in February 2000. In October 2000, Providential Securities withdrew its securities brokerage membership and ceased its financial
services business. Subsequently, in April 2009, the Company changed its name to PHI Group, Inc. From October 2000 to October 2011,
the Company was engaged in mergers and acquisitions advisory and consulting services, real estate and hospitality development,
mining, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology, healthcare, private equity, and special situations. In October 2011, the
Company discontinued the operations of Providential Vietnam Ltd., Philand Ranch Limited, a United Kingdom corporation, (together
with its subsidiaries Philand Ranch - Singapore, Philand Corporation (US), and Philand Vietnam Ltd.), PHI Gold Corporation (formerly
PHI Mining Corporation), and PHI Energy Corporation, and began to mainly focus on acquisition and development opportunities in
energy and natural resource businesses. The Company has recently expanded its scope of acquisitions to include other industries
besides energy and natural resources. In addition, PHI Capital Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, continues to
provide corporate and project finance services, including merger and acquisition (M A) advisory and consulting services and
arranging capital for other companies in a variety of industries.  

PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION   

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PHI Group, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary PHI Capital Holdings, Inc.,
and its discontinued operations Providential Securities, Inc., PHI Energy Corporation, PHI Gold Corp, Providential Vietnam Ltd.
and Philand Ranch Limited (including its 100% owned subsidiary Philand Corporation and Philand Vietnam Ltd), Omni Resources, Inc.,
and American Pacific Resources, Inc., collectively referred to as the  Company.  All significant inter-company transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.  

INTERIM
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article
10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. These statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting
of normal reoccurring accruals have been made to the financial statements. The results of operation for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.  

USE
OF ESTIMATES   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase that are readily convertible
into cash to be cash equivalents.  

MARKETABLE
SECURITIES   

The
Company s securities are classified as available-for-sale and, as such, are carried at fair value. Securities classified
as available-for-sale may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs, and for other purposes.  

Typically,
each investment in marketable securities represents less than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding common stock and stock equivalents
of the investee, and each security is quoted on either the  Pink Sheets  or the OTC Bulletin Board. As such, each
investment is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115.  

Unrealized
holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
stockholder s equity. Realized gains and losses for securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in earnings
based upon the adjusted cost of the specific security sold. On September 30, 2016, the marketable securities have been recorded
at $456,686 based upon the fair value of the marketable securities, including the value of 97,350,000 shares of Sports Pouch Beverage
Company s common stock to be returned to the client company (Note 3).  

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

Fair
Value - Definition and Hierarchy     

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether
or not the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The categorization of financial
assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement.  

A
fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the
use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs are to be used when available.  

Valuation
techniques that are consistent with the market or income approach are used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy is
categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:  

Level
 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the
ability to access.  

Level
 2 - Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.  

Level
 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  

Fair
value is a market-based measure, based on assumptions of prices and inputs considered from the perspective of a market participant
that are current as of the measurement date, rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are
not readily available, the Company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability at the measurement date. The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from investment
to investment and are affected by a wide variety of factors, including; type of investment, whether the investment is new and
not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.  

To
the extent that valuation is based upon models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination
of fair value requires more judgment. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially
higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. Accordingly, the degree
of judgment exercised by the Fund in determining fair value is greatest for investments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases,
the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in
the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based upon the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement.  

Fair
Value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs     

The
Company holds and may invest in public securities traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC), private securities, real
estate, convertible securities, interest bearing securities and other types of securities and has adopted specific techniques
for their respective valuations.  

Equity
Securities in Public Companies    

Unrestricted   

The
Company values investments in securities that are freely tradable and listed on major securities exchanges at their last reported
sales price as of the valuation date. To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are not applied,
they are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  

Securities
traded on inactive markets or valued by reference to similar instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 or 3 of the fair
value hierarchy.  

Restricted   

Securities
traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) where there are formal restrictions that limit (i.e. Rule 144 holding periods
and underwriter s lock-ups) their sale shall be valued at the closing price on the date of valuation less applicable discounts.
The Company may apply a discount to securities with Rule 144 restrictions. Additional discounts may be assessed if the Company
believes there are other mitigating factors, which warrant the additional discounting. When determining potential additional discounts,
factors that will be taken into consideration include, but are not limited to; securities  trading characteristics, volume,
length and overall impact of the restriction as well as other macro-economic factors. Valuations should be discounted appropriately
until the securities may be freely traded.  

If
it has been determined that the exchange or OTC listed price does not accurately reflect fair market value, the Company may elect
to treat the security as a private company and apply an alternative valuation method.  

Investments
in restricted securities of public companies may be included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, to the extent that
significant inputs used to determine liquidity discounts are not observable, investments in restricted securities in public companies
may be categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  

The
Company s financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities,
and accounts payable.  

As
of the balance sheet dates, the estimated fair values of the financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying
values as presented on the balance sheet. This is primarily attributed to the short maturities of these instruments.  

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE   

Management
reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts. As of Sept 30, 2016, the Company had $25,000
in accounts receivable.  

PROPERTIES
AND EQUIPMENT   

Property
and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful life of the assets from three to five years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
as incurred.  

REVENUE
RECOGNITION   

The
Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC 13 (previously Staff accounting bulletin (SAB) 104). The
Company recognizes consulting and advisory fee revenues when the transaction is completed and the service fees are earned. Expenses
are recognized in the period in which the corresponding liability is incurred. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria
for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue.  

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION    

Effective
July 1, 2006, the Company adopted ASC 718-10-25 (previously SFAS 123R) and accordingly has adopted the modified prospective application
method. Under this method, ASC 718-10-25 is applied to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the
effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards that are outstanding as of the date of adoption for
which the requisite service has not been rendered (such as unvested options) is recognized over a period of time as the remaining
requisite services are rendered.  

RISKS
AND UNCERTAINTIES   

In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. The Company provides its service and
receives marketable securities upon execution of transactions. Consequently, the value of the securities received from customers
can be affected by economic fluctuations and each customer s business growth. The actual realized value of these securities
could be significantly different than recorded value.

NOTE
18      GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY   

As
shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $38,150,374 and total liabilities
and stockholders  deficit of $787,045 as of September 30, 2016. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred
a net loss from operations of $375,531 as compared to a net income from operations in the amount of $19,874 during the same period
ended September 30, 2015. These factors as well as the uncertain conditions that the Company faces in its day-to-day operations
with respect to cash flows create an uncertainty as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Management has taken action to strengthen the Company s working capital position and generate sufficient cash to meet its
operating needs through June 30, 2017 and beyond.  

In
the next twelve months the Company intends to continue pursuing its merger and acquisition program by acquiring all or controlling
interests in target companies in a number of industries, including but not limited to conventional energy, renewables, natural
resources, agribusiness, technology, transportation, education, distribution, mining, oil   gas, financial Services, healthcare,
and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the Company also plans to invest in special situations that may potentially generate significant
revenues and profitability for the Company in the short term. We believe that by closing one or more of the contemplated acquisitions
we will be able to build a critical mass and uplist to the Nasdaq Stock Market or NYSE in the near future. In addition, we will
continue to provide advisory and consulting services to international clients through our wholly owned subsidiary PHI Capital
Holdings, Inc.   The Company anticipates generating
substantial amounts of revenues through the merger and acquisition program, investment in special situations, and advisory services
mentioned herein. However, no assurances could be made that management would be successful in achieving its plan. The president
and chairman of the Company has committed to funding the Company s operations from various sources for the next 12 months.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
Company s financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective
interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported.
These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the external disclosures of the Company including information
regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere
to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed by us for reasonableness and
conservatism on a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where financial information of the Company is subject
to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include acquisitions, valuation of long-lived and intangible
assets, recoverability of deferred tax and the valuation of shares issued for services. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

Valuation
of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets  

The
recoverability of long-lived assets requires considerable judgment and is evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events
or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. As it relates to definite life intangible assets, we apply the impairment
rules as required by SFAS No. 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Assets to Be Disposed Of 
as amended by SFAS No. 144, which also requires significant judgment and assumptions related to the expected future cash flows
attributable to the intangible asset. The impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate
of fair value and, thus, the recoverability of the asset.  

Income
Taxes  

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the
tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation
allowance based upon historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary
differences. As of March 31, 2016, we estimated the allowance on net deferred tax assets to be one hundred percent of the net
deferred tax assets.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

The
following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
our financial condition at September 30, 2016 and factors that we believe could affect our future financial condition and results
of operations. Historical results may not be indicative of future performance.  

This
discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles in the United States ( GAAP ). All references to dollar amounts in this section are in United States dollars.  

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015    

Total
Revenues:   

The
Company had $50,000 in revenue from consulting services for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $40,000 in revenue
for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $10,000 between the two periods.  

Operating
Costs and Expenses:   

Total
operating expenses were $239,946 and $96,929 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  

The
variance of $143,017 in operating expenses between the two periods was primarily due to an increase in professional services of
$128,280, and an increase in general and administrative expenses of $15,237 during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in professional services was due to additional expenses in connection with due
diligence review of new acquisition targets during the current quarter. General and administrative expenses were $28,772 and $13,535
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses between
the two comparable periods was primarily due to an increase in advertising expenses of $8,695 and an increase in filing fees of
$4,168, respectively.  

Income
(Loss) from Operations:   

Loss
from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $189,946, as compared to loss from operations for the same period
ended September 30, 2015 was $56,929, respectively, due to factors mentioned in Total Revenues and Operating Costs and Expenses
above.  

Other
Income and Expenses:   

Net
other expenses were $185,585 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net other income of $76,803 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other expenses of $262,388 between the two periods was mainly due to an
increase in interest expense of $95,559 in connection with the conversion of the promissory note dated February 29, 2016 into
common stock of the Company by Auctus Fund, LLC, an increase in other expense of $10,494, and a variance of $156,335 due to loss
on sale of marketable securities, respectively.  

Interest
expenses were $175,136 and $79,576 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Net
Income (Loss):   

Net
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $375,531, as compared to a net income of $76,803 for the same period in
2015, which is equivalent to ($0.04) per share for the current period and $0.01 for the corresponding period ended September 30,
2015, based on the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding at the end of each corresponding period.  

CASH
FLOWS   

The
Company s cash and cash equivalents balance were $6,205 and $208,745 as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Net
cash used in the Company s operating activities during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $227,170, as
compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $516,008 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. This
represents a variance of $743,178 in net cash used in operating activities and net cash provided by operating activities between
the two periods. The underlying reason for the variance was primarily due to a net loss from operations of $375,531 during the
three-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net income from operations in the amount of $19,874 during the corresponding
three-month period ended September 30, 2015; an increase in other assets and prepaid expenses in the amount of $29,332 during
the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a decrease in other assets and prepaid expenses in the amount
of $166,820 during the corresponding three-month period ended September 30, 2015; and an increase in accounts payable and accrued
expenses in the amount of $177,693 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to an increase in accounts
payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $329,315 during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
Company used $149,509 in investing activities during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 and did not have any investing
activities during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016.  

Cash
provided by financing activities was $230,893 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to cash used in
financing activities in the amount of $168,410 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The primary underlying reasons
for the variance of $399,303 between the two periods were due to an increase in proceeds from common stock of $248,942 during
the current period as a result of certain creditors  conversions of debts into common stock of the Company, a change in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss) of $27,757, a change in Accumulated Deficit of $87,108, a change in Treasury Stock
of $13,972, and a change in net borrowings from officers in the amount of $15,824 between the current three-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and the corresponding previous period ended September 30, 2015.  

HISTORICAL
FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS   

SHORT
TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK: In the course of its business, the Company has obtained short-term loans from
individuals and institutional investors and from time to time raised money by issuing restricted common stock of the Company under
the auspices of Rule 144. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had short-term notes payable amounting to $631,538
and $673,660 with accrued interest of $2,912,218 and $2,879,655, respectively. These notes bear interest rates ranging from 0%
to 36% per annum.  

CONVERTIBLE
PROMISSORY NOTES:  

On
February 29, 2016, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $56,750 to Auctus Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company. This convertible note is due and payable on November 29, 2016 with interest of 10% per annum. This note is
convertible at the election of Auctus Fund, LLC from time to time after the issuance date. In the event of default, the amount
of principal and interest not paid when due bear interest at the rate of 24% per annum and the note becomes immediately due and
payable. Should an event of default occur, the Company is liable to pay 150% of the then outstanding principal and interest. The
note agreement contains covenants requiring Auctus Fund s written consent for certain activities not in existence or not
committed to by the Company on the issuance date of the note, as follows: dividend distributions in cash or shares, stock repurchases,
borrowings, sale of assets, certain advances and loans in excess of $100,000, and certain guarantees with respect to preservation
of existence of the Company and non-circumvention. Outstanding note principal and interest accrued thereon can be converted in
whole, or in part, at any time by Auctus after the issuance date into an equivalent of the Company s common stock determined
by 55% of the average of the two lowest closing trading prices of the Company s common stock during the twenty (20) trading
days prior to the date the conversion notice is sent by Auctus. The Company may prepay the amounts outstanding to Auctus Fund
at any time up to the 180 th  day following the issue date of this note by making a payment to the note holder of an
amount in cash equal to 125% to 150%, multiplied by the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note  plus
 (x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of this Note  plus  (y) Default Interest, depending on
the time of prepayment.  

  On
August 30, 2016, Auctus Fund, LLC converted the principal amount of $56,750 and $2,829.76 in accrued interest, totaling $59,579.76,
into 529,598 shares of free-trading stock of the Company.  

On
July 20, 2016, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $50,000 to EMA Financial, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company. The note has a coupon rate of 10%, matures in one year and is convertible to Common Stock of the Company at
a conversion price equals the lower of: (i) the closing sale price of the Common Stock on the Principal Market on the Trading
immediately preceding the Closing Date of this note, and (ii) 55% of the lowest sale price for the Common Stock on the Principal
Market during the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the Conversion Date. The note may be prepaid at 130%
- 145% of outstanding principal and interest up to 180 days.  

On
August 16, 2016, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $56,750 to Auctus Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company. The note has a coupon rate of 10%, matures on May 16, 2017 and is convertible to Common Stock of the Company
at a conversion price equals the lower of: (i) 50% multiplied by the average of the two lowest Trading Price during the previous
twenty-five Trading Day period ending on the latest complete Trading Date prior to the date of this note and (ii) 50% multiplied
by the average of the two lowest Trading Prices for the Common Stock during the twenty-five Trading Day period ending on the latest
complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date. The note may be prepaid at 135% - 150% of outstanding principal and interest
up to 180 days.  

The
Company intends to prepay these notes within the respective allowable prepayment time frames.  

The
value of the derivative liabilities at September 30, 2010 is $160,488.  

COMPANY S
PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS   

In
the next twelve months the Company intends to continue pursuing its merger and acquisition program by acquiring all or controlling
interests in target companies in a number of industries, including but not limited to conventional energy, renewables, natural
resources, agribusiness, technology, transportation, education, distribution, mining, oil   gas, financial Services, healthcare,
and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the Company also plans to invest in special situations that may potentially generate significant
revenues and profitability for the Company in the short term. We believe that by closing one or more of the contemplated acquisitions
we will be able to build a critical mass and uplist to the Nasdaq Stock Market or NYSE in the near future. Moreover, we will continue
to provide advisory and consulting services to international clients through our wholly owned subsidiary PHI Capital Holdings,
Inc.   The Company anticipates generating substantial
amounts of revenues through the merger and acquisition program, investment in special situations, and advisory services mentioned
herein. However, no assurances could be made that management would be successful in achieving its plan. The president and chairman
of the Company has committed to funding the Company s operations from various sources for the next 12 months.  

FINANCIAL
PLANS    

MATERIAL
CASH REQUIREMENTS: We must raise substantial amounts of capital to fulfill our plan of acquiring energy-related and natural resource
assets as part of our scope of business. We intend to use equity, debt and project financing to meet our capital needs for acquisitions.  

Management
has taken action and formulated plans to strengthen the Company s working capital position and generate sufficient cash
to meet its operating needs through June 30, 2017 and beyond. The working capital cash requirements for the next 12 months are
expected to be generated from operations, sale of marketable securities and additional financing. The Company plans to generate
revenues from its consulting services, merger and acquisition advisory services, and acquisitions of target companies with cash
flows.  

AVAILABLE
FUTURE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS: In September 2016 the Company  signed an agreement with Milost
Global, Inc., a U.S. private equity firm, for a commitment of up to $100 million to finance the Company s future acquisitions
and provide for working capital needs. Investment in the amount of USD 50 million will be as equity and USD 50 million as loans.
 In addition, the Company may use other sources of funds, including short-term loans and long-term debt and equity financing,
as may be needed. The Company believes it will be able to secure the required capital to implement its business plan; however,
no assurances could be made that management would be successful in achieving its plan.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

The
following discussion about PHI Group Inc. s market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.  

Currency
Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk   

Some
of our operations are conducted in other countries whose official currencies are not U.S. dollars. However, the effect of the
fluctuations of exchange rates is considered minimal to our business operations.  

Interest
Rate Risk   

We
do not have significant interest rate risk, as most of our debt obligations are primarily short-term in nature to individuals,
with fixed interest rates.  

Valuation
of Securities Risk   

Since
majority of our income is paid with the marketable securities, the value of our assets may fluctuate significantly depending on
the market value of the securities we hold.  

ITEM
4.    Controls and Procedures     

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), our management
carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the period covered by this
report. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based upon their evaluation, our management (including our Chief Executive Officer) concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2015, based on the material weaknesses defined below.  

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting   

Management s
Report on Internal Control of Financial Reporting   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is a set of processes designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive
and principal financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:  

-  
      pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of
    our assets,   

-  
      provide
    reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in
    accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
    and directors, and   

-  
      provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of authorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
    that could have a material effect on our financial statements.   

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted
that any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
the Company s management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of June 30, 2015 based on the framework set forth in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  

We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:  

(i)  
      inadequate
    segregation of duties consistent with control objectives;   

(ii)  
      ineffective
    controls over period-end financial disclosure and reporting processes.   

If
we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately
report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company.  

Based
on this assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of September 30, 2016.  

   Management s
Remediation Plan    

We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered
by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate
such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes in the future:  

(i)  
      appoint
    additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and   

(ii)  
      adopt
    sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting.   

The
remediation efforts set out in (i) are largely dependent upon our company securing additional financing to cover the costs of
implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected
in a material manner. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  

Management
believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our consolidated financial statements for the quarterly report
ended September 30, 2016 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP.  

Attestation
Report of the Registered Accounting Firm   

This
Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm pursuant to Rule 308(b) of Regulation S-K, which permits the Company to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

No
changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting have come to management s attention during the
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM
1. LEG.AL PROCEEDINGS    

Other
than as set forth below, Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings and, to the best of its knowledge, no
such action by or against Company has been threatened.  

LEGAL
PROCEEDING SETTLED AND UNPAID AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016:    

QUANG
VAN CAO AND NHAN THI NGUYEN CAO VS. PROVIDENTIAL SECURITIES, INC. ET AL.  

This
case was originally submitted to Orange County Superior Court, CA on June 25, 1997, Case No. 781121, and subsequently moved to
NASD Dispute resolution for arbitration. On or about August 24, 2000, the Company s legal counsel negotiated with the Claimant s
counsel and unilaterally reached a settlement that had not been approved by the Company. While the Company was in the process
of re-negotiating the terms of said settlement, the Claimants filed a request for arbitration hearing before the National Association
of Securities Dealers on October 4, 2000, Case No. 99-03160. Thereafter, the Claimants filed a complaint with the Orange County
Superior Court, CA on October 31, 2000, Case No. 00CC13067 for alleged breach of contract for damages in the sum of $75,000 plus
pre-judgment interest, costs incurred in connection with the complaint, and other relief. Without admitting or denying any allegations,
the Company reached a settlement agreement with the Claimants whereby the Company would pay the Claimants a total of $62,500 plus
$4,500 in administrative costs. As the date of this report, the Company has paid $2,500 and is subject to an entry of judgment
for $79,000. In May 2011, the Claimants filed an application for and renewal of judgment for a total of $140,490.78. As of September
30, 2016 the Company accrued $172,091 for potential liabilities in connection with this case in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.  

WILLIAM
DAVIDSON VS. DOAN ET AL.  

On
or about February 01, 2010, the company was notified of a suit that was filed with the Superior Court of the State of California
for the County of Los Angeles on November 24, 2009 by William Davidson, an individual against Martin Doan, Henry Fahman, Benjamin
Tran, HRCiti Corporation, and Providential Capital, Inc. (collectively referred to as  Defendants  - Case No. BC 426831).
Plaintiff demanded an amount of not less than $140,000.00 from Defendants for promissory notes outstanding between Plaintiff and
the company.  

On
July 09, 2012 William Davidson and PHI Capital Holdings, Inc. (formerly Providential Capital, Inc.), a subsidiary of the Company,
reached a settlement agreement with respect to whereby PHI Capital agreed to pay William Davidson a total of $200,000 over a period
of nineteen months beginning September 1, 2012. Since November 30, 2012, William Davidson has converted portions of the total
amount into common stock of PHI Group, Inc. in lieu of cash payment. The Company has accrued $90,000 as the required liability
associated with the balance of these notes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016.  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS    

Investment
in our securities is subject to various risks, including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. The following sets
forth factors related to our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could
cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss.   

General
Risks Related to Our Business    

Our
success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.    

Our
future success will depend in substantial part on the continued service of our senior management. The loss of the services of
one or more of our key personnel could impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and result in the failure
to reach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance for any of our officers or employees. Our future success will also
depend on the continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing
our operations. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able to attract, train or
retain qualified personnel in the future.  

Our
strategy in mergers and acquisitions involves a number of risks and we have a limited history of successful acquisitions. Even
when an acquisition is completed, we may have to continue our service for integration that may not produce results as positive
as management may have projected.    

The
Company is in the process of evaluating various opportunities and negotiating to acquire other companies, assets and technologies.
Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion
of management s attention from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of
key employees of acquired companies. We have limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations into our operations. Although
potential synergy may be achieved by acquisitions of related technologies and businesses, no assurance can be given as to the
Company s ability to integrate successfully any operations, personnel, services or products that have been acquired or might
be acquired in the future. Failure to successfully assimilate acquired organizations could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s business, financial condition and operating results.  

Acquisitions
involve a number of special risks, including:  

failure
    of the acquired business to achieve expected results;  

diversion
    of management s attention;  

failure
    to retain key personnel of the acquired business;  

additional
    financing, if necessary and available, could increase leverage, dilute equity, or both;  

the
    potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles; and  

the
    high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.  

These
risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition since the values of
the securities received for the consulting service at the execution of the acquisition depend on the success of the company involved
in acquisition. In addition, our ability to further expand our operations through acquisitions may be dependent on our ability
to obtain sufficient working capital, either through cash flows generated through operations or financing activities or both.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.  

As
some of our business activities are currently involved with Southeast Asia, any adverse change to the economy or business environment
in these countries could significantly affect our operations, which would lead to lower revenues and reduced profitability   .   

Some
of our business activities are currently involved with Southeast Asia. Because of this presence in specific geographic locations,
we are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region, including stock
market fluctuation. A stagnant or depressed economy in these countries generally, or in any of the other markets that we serve,
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

Risks
associated with energy business     

As
part of our core business involves acquisitions of energy assets as well as production and trading of energy commodities, our
profitability will depend on the prices we receive for energy commodities such as coal and wood pellets. These prices are dependent
upon factors beyond our control, including: the strength of the global economy; the demand for electricity; the global supply
of thermal coal and biomass products; weather patterns and natural disasters; competition within our industry and the availability
and price of alternatives, including natural gas; the proximity, capacity and cost of transportation; coal industry capacity;
domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including those establishing air emission standards for coal-fueled power
plants or mandating increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources; regulatory, administrative and judicial decisions,
including those affecting future mining permits; and technological developments, including those intended to convert coal-to-liquids
or gas and those aimed at capturing and storing carbon dioxide.  

Risks
Related to Our Securities    

Insiders
have substantial control over the company, and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control, even if our other
stockholders wanted such a change to occur.    

Though
our executive officers and directors as of November 14, 2016, in the aggregate, only hold approximately 27.53% of our outstanding
common stock, our Board of Directors is able to decide the rights and terms associated with the Company s Preferred Stock,
which decision may allow the Board of Directors to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval,
including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could delay or prevent an outside
party from acquiring or merging with us even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur.  

The
price at which investors purchase our common stock may not be indicative of the prevailing market price.     

The
stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific
companies whose stock is traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares. Investors may
be unable to sell their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses.  

Since
we do not currently meet the requirements for our stock to be quoted on NASDAQ, NYSE MKT LLC or any other senior exchange, the
tradability in our securities will be limited under the penny stock regulations.    

Under
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, if the price of our securities on the OTCQB or OTC Markets is below $5.00
per share, our securities are within the definition of a  penny stock.  As a result, it is possible that our securities
may be subject to the  penny stock  rules and regulations. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of
investors are required to comply with the Commission s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock. These regulations
require broker-dealers to:  

*Make
a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser;  

*Receive
the purchaser s written consent to the transaction; and  

*Provide
certain written disclosures to the purchaser.  

These
requirements may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may affect the ability to resell our securities.  

Our
compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming, difficult and costly
for us.    

It
may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance staff in order
to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal
controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications that the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires publicly traded companies to obtain.  

Our
success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.    

Our
future success will depend in substantial part on the continued service of our senior management and founder. The loss of the
services of one or more of our key personnel could impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and result in
the failure to reach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance for any of our officers or employees. Our future success
will also depend on the continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required
for continuing our operations. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able to attract,
train or retain qualified personnel in the future.  

Our
service strategy in merger and acquisition involves a number of risks and we have a limited history of successful acquisitions.
Even when an acquisition is completed, we may have to continue our service for integration that may not produce results as positive
as management may have projected.    

The
Company is in the process of evaluating various opportunities and negotiating to acquire other companies and technologies. Acquisitions
entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion of management s
attention from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees of acquired
companies. We have limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations into our operations. Although potential synergy may
be achieved by acquisitions of related technologies and businesses, no assurance can be given as to the Company s ability
to integrate successfully any operations, personnel, services or products that have been acquired or might be acquired in the
future. Failure to successfully assimilate acquired organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, financial condition and operating results.  

Acquisitions
involve a number of special risks, including:  

failure
    of the acquired business to achieve expected results;   

diversion
    of management s attention;   

failure
    to retain key personnel of the acquired business;   

additional
    financing, if necessary and available, could increase leverage, dilute equity, or both;   

the
    potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles; and   

the
    high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.   

These
risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition since the values of
the securities received for the consulting service at the execution of the acquisition depend on the success of the company involved
in acquisition. In addition, our ability to further expand our operations through acquisitions may be dependent on our ability
to obtain sufficient working capital, either through cash flows generated through operations or financing activities or both.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
