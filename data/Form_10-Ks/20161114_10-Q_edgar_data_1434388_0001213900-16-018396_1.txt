       ORGANIZATION
    AND BUSINESS    

Wonhe
High-Tech International, Inc. (the  Company  or  Wonhe High-Tech ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada
on August 13, 2007. The Company changed its name from Baby Fox International, Inc. to Wonhe High-Tech International, Inc. on April
20, 2012. On June 27, 2012, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of World Win International Holding Ltd.
or  World Win  in exchange for 19,128,130 shares of the Company s common stock (the  Share Exchange ).  

As
a result of the acquisition in June 2012, the Company s consolidated subsidiaries included World Win, the Company s
wholly-owned subsidiary, which is incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Island ( BVI ), Kuayu International
Holdings Group Limited (Hong Kong), or  Kuayu,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of World Win which is incorporated under
the laws of Hong Kong, and Shengshihe Management Consulting (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., or  Shengshihe Consulting,  a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Kuayu which is incorporated under the laws of the People s Republic of China ( PRC ). The Company
also consolidated the financial position and results of operations of Shenzhen Wonhe Technology Co., Ltd., or  Shenzhen
Wonhe,  a company incorporated under the laws of the PRC which was effectively and substantially controlled by Shengshihe
Consulting through a series of captive agreements. Shenzhen Wonhe was considered a variable interest entity ( VIE )
of Shengshihe Consulting.  

On
May 30, 2012, Shenzhen Wonhe entered into (i) an Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement, (ii)
a Proxy Agreement, (iii) Share Pledge Agreement, and (iv) Call Option Agreement with Shengshihe Consulting.  The
foregoing agreements are collectively referred to as the  VIE Agreements.   

Exclusive
Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement:  Pursuant to the Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement, Shengshihe
Consulting provided technical support, consulting, training, marketing and business consulting services to Shenzhen
Wonhe as related to its business activities.  In consideration for such services, Shenzhen Wonhe agreed to pay
as an annual service fee to Shengshihe Consulting, 95% of Shenzhen Wonhe s annual net income plus an additional monthly
payment of approximately $8,015 (RMB 50,000).  The agreement had an unlimited term and could only be terminated by mutual
agreement of the parties.  

Proxy
Agreement:  Pursuant to the Proxy Agreement, the stockholders of Shenzhen Wonhe agreed to irrevocably entrust Shengshihe
Consulting to designate a qualified person, acceptable under PRC law and foreign investment policies, to vote all of the equity
interests in Shenzhen Wonhe held by each of its stockholders.  The Agreement had an unlimited term and could only be
terminated by mutual agreement of the parties.  

Call
Option Agreement:  Pursuant to the Call Option Agreement, Shengshihe Consulting had an exclusive option to purchase,
or to designate a purchaser for, to the extent permitted by PRC law and foreign investment policies, part or all of the equity
interests in Shenzhen Wonhe held by each of its stockholders.  To the extent permitted by PRC laws, the purchase price
for the entire equity interest was approximately $0.16 (RMB1.00) or the minimum amount required by PRC law or government practice.  

Share
Pledge Agreement:  Pursuant to the Share Pledge Agreement, the stockholders of Shenzhen Wonhe pledged their shares to
Shengshihe Consulting to secure the obligations of Shenzhen Wonhe under the Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting
Agreement.  In addition, the stockholders of Shenzhen Wonhe agreed not to transfer, sell, pledge, dispose of or create
any encumbrance on their interests in Shenzhen Wonhe that would affect Shengshihe Consulting s interests.

1.   
       ORGANIZATION
    AND BUSINESS (continued)    

Until
September 15, 2015, Shengshihe Management controlled Shenzhen Wonhe through the above contractual agreements, which made Shenzhen
Wonhe a variable interest entity, the effect of which was to cause the balance sheet and operating results of Shenzhen Wonhe to
be consolidated with those of Shengshihe Management in the Company s financial statements.  

On
September 15, 2015, Shengshihe Consulting, exercised its option to purchase all of the registered equity of Shenzhen Wonhe. The
purchase price paid for the equity was RMB10,000 (approximately $1,569). The equity was purchased from Qing Tong, Nanfang Tong,
Youliang Wang and Jingwu Li, who are the members of Wonhe High-Tech s Board of Directors. As a result of the acquisition
by Shengshihe Consulting of the registered ownership of Shenzhen Wonhe, the balance sheet and operating results of Shenzhen Wonhe
will hereafter continue to be consolidated with those of Shengshihe Consulting as its 100% owned subsidiary.  

In
July 2015, World Win, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, organized Wonhe Multimedia Commerce Ltd. ( Australian
Wonhe ) under Australian law. 60% of the capital stock of Australian Wonhe was issued to World Win, 25% was issued to Wonhe
International (Hong Kong), which is wholly owned and controlled by Qing Tong, who is Chairman of the Board of Wonhe High-Tech
and the remaining 15% was issued to three non-affiliated financial consultants. On August 5, 2015, World Win sold all of the outstanding
capital stock of Kuayu to Australian Wonhe. In exchange for Kuayu, Australian Wonhe paid World Win $10,000 Hong Kong Dollars (US
$1,290). Kuayu is the sole owner of Shengshihe Consulting, which in turn had the VIE agreements with Shenzhen Wonhe at that time,
the Company s VIE and operating company. The sale of Kuayu, therefore, reduced the interest of the Company in its operating
company by 40%.  

On
December 21, 2015, the Company s 60% owned subsidiary, Australia Wonhe was listed on the ASX and sold 16,951,802 of its
ordinary shares for net proceeds of $1,941,318.  

The
33,750,000 shares of Australia Wonhe issued to the chairman of the board s wholly owned company, Wonhe International (Hong
Kong), and the 20,250,000 shares issued to the financial consultants were recognized as compensation during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The value of the compensation was determined using the public offering price of $0.13952 US per share for
the shares to be sold in Australia. The total stock compensation recognized was $7,534,080.

       SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     

Basis
of Accounting and Presentation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. The consolidated financial
statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include Wonhe High-Tech, World Win, Wonhe
Multimedia, Kuayu, Shengshihe Consulting and Shenzhen Wonhe. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America and the rules and regulations of the SEC which apply to interim financial statements. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, such information contains all adjustments, consisting
only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. The interim
consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto,
included in the Company s Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future quarters or for the year ending December
31, 2016.  

All
consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars ( US
Dollar  or  US$  or  $ ).  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Foreign
Currency Translation   

Almost
all of the Company s assets are located in the PRC. The functional currency for the majority of the operations is the Renminbi
( RMB ). For Kuayu, the functional currency for the majority of its operations is the Hong Kong Dollar ( HKD ).
For Australian Wonhe, the functional currency is the Australian dollar ( AUD ). The Company uses the US Dollar for
financial reporting purposes. The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been translated into US dollars in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB  Accounting Standards Codification  ASC  section 830,
  Foreign Currency Matters.    

All
asset and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Equity accounts
have been translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred. The consolidated statements of
operations and other comprehensive income (loss) amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the periods
presented. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the Company s consolidated financial statements are recorded as
other comprehensive income (loss).

   NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

   FOR
THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015    

   (UNAUDITED,
IN U.S. $)   

2.   
       SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Foreign
Currency Translation (continued)    

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency translation adjustments of $209,449 and $(2,354,088)
respectively, $(1,396,779) and $(2,191,963), respectively, have been reported as other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive
income (loss) of the Company consists solely of foreign currency translation adjustments. Pursuant to FASB ASC 740-30-25-17,   Exceptions
to Comprehensive Recognition of Deferred Income Taxes,   the Company does not recognize deferred U.S. taxes related to
the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, recognizes no income tax expense or benefit from foreign
currency translation adjustments.  

Although
government regulations now allow convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain.
Hence, such translations should not be construed as representations that the RMB could be converted into US and Australian dollars
at that rate or any other rate.  

The
value of the RMB against the US and Australian dollar may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC s
political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially affect the Company s financial
condition in terms of US dollar reporting.  

Revenue
and Cost Recognition   

The
Company receives revenues from the sale of electronic products. The Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance
with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) 104 (codified in FASB ASC Topic 605).  Sales revenue is recognized
when the products are delivered and when customer acceptance occurs, the price is fixed or determinable, no other significant
obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Finished goods are delivered from outsourced manufacturers
to the Company.  Revenue is recognized when the title to the products has been passed to the customer, which is the
date the products are picked up by the customer at the Company s location or delivered to the designated locations by Company
employees and accepted by the customer and the previously discussed requirements are met. The customer s acceptance occurs
upon inspection at the time of pickup or delivery by signing an acceptance form.    

The
Company does not provide its customers with the right of return. A 36-month warranty is offered to customers for exchange or repair
of defective products, the cost of which is substantially covered by the outsourced manufacturers  warranty policies as
specified in the contract between the Company and its outsourced manufacturers. As a result, the Company does not recognize a
warranty liability.    

The
Company follows the guidance set forth by FASB ASC 605-45-45 to assess whether the Company acts as the principal or agent in the
transaction.  The determination involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of whether the Company has the substantial
risks and rewards of ownership under the terms of the arrangement.  Based on the assessment, the Company determined
it acts as a principal in the transaction and reports revenues on the gross basis.  

FASB
ASC 605-45-45 sets forth eight criteria that support reporting recognition of gross revenue (i.e. principal sales) and three that
support reporting net revenue (i.e. agent sales).  As applied to the relationship between the Company, its manufacturers,
and its customers, the following are the criteria that support reporting gross revenue:

       SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Revenue
and Cost Recognition (continued)    

Shenzhen
    Wonhe is the primary obligor in each sale, as it is responsible for fulfillment of customer orders, including the acceptability
    of the products purchased by the customer.    

Shenzhen
    Wonhe has general inventory risk, as it takes title to a product before that product is ordered by or delivered to a customer.   

Shenzhen
    Wonhe establishes its own pricing for its products.   

Shenzhen
    Wonhe has discretion in supplier selection.    

Shenzhen
    Wonhe designed the Home Media Center Model 720 (the  HMC720 ) and the two Wi-Fi Routers and is responsible for
    all of its specifications.    

Shenzhen
    Wonhe has physical inventory loss risk until the product is delivered to the customer.   

Shenzhen
    Wonhe has full credit risk for amounts billed to its customers.   

The
only criterion supporting recognition of gross revenue that is not satisfied by the relationship between the Company and its manufacturers
is: the entity changes the product or performs part of the service.  Moreover, none of the three criteria supporting
recognition of net revenue is present in the Company s sales transactions.  For this reason, the Company records
gross revenue with respect to sales by Shenzhen Wonhe.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

FASB
ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions
other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs). In accordance
with ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy:  

Level
    1  
      Inputs
      Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the
    ability to access.   

Level
    2  
      Inputs
      Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.   

Level
    3  
      Inputs
      Inputs based on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value
    measurements.   

ASC
820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure
fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Valuation techniques used need to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none
of the Company s assets and liabilities was required to be reported at fair value on a recurring basis. Carrying values
of non-derivative financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable and various payables, approximate their fair values
due to the short term nature of these financial instruments. There were no changes in methods or assumptions during the periods
presented.

       SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Advertising
Costs   

Advertising
costs are paid to an advertising agency for market analysis and strategic planning and are charged to operations when incurred.
Advertising costs were $112,514 and $134,316, respectively, $341,975 and $232,056, respectively, for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Research
and Development Costs   

The
Company develops software to be marketed as part of its products, and that is not for internal use. The software is essential
to the functionality of the Company s tangible products. Therefore, the Company accounts for research and development costs
incurred in development of its software in accordance with FASB ASC 985-20.  

Research
and development costs are charged to operations when incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise
marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending
when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company s products are released soon
after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility
are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred. Research and development
costs were $225,067 and $48,770, respectively, and $378,585 and $104,155, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all demand and time deposits and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.  

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable are stated at cost, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables outstanding longer than the payment terms
are considered past due. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure
of customers to make required payments, when due. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes allowances
where there is doubt as to the collectability of the outstanding balance. In evaluating the collectability of an individual receivable
balance, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, the customer s payment history, its current
credit-worthiness and current economic trends. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company considered all accounts
receivable collectable and an allowance for doubtful accounts was not necessary. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not write off any accounts receivable as bad debts.

       SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Fixed
Assets and Depreciation   

F ixed
assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the price paid to acquire the asset, and any expenditure
that substantially increases the asset s value or extends the useful life of an existing asset. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of the remaining term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Major repairs and betterments that significantly
extend original useful lives or improve productivity are capitalized and depreciated over the periods benefited. Maintenance and
repairs are generally expensed as incurred.   

The
estimated useful lives for fixed asset categories are as follows:  

Office
    equipment  
         
      5
    years   

Motor
    vehicles

    years   

Leasehold
    improvements  
         
      Shorter
    of the remaining term of the lease or life of the improvement   

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets   

The
Company applies FASB ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment,   which addresses the financial accounting and
reporting for the recognition and measurement of impairment losses for long-lived assets. In accordance with ASC 360, long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. The Company may recognize the impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets
exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets. No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized for
the periods presented.  

Statutory
Reserve Fund   

Pursuant
to corporate law of the PRC, Shengshihe Consulting and Shenzhen Wonhe are required to transfer 10% of their net income, as determined
under PRC accounting rules and regulations, to a statutory reserve fund until such reserve balance reaches 50% of their registered
capital. The statutory reserve fund is non-distributable, other than during liquidation, and can be used to fund prior years 
losses, if any, and may be utilized for business expansion or used to increase registered capital, provided that the remaining
reserve balance after such use is not less than 25% of the registered capital. As of September 30, 2016, $2,123,887 has been transferred
from retained earnings to the statutory reserve fund.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740,   Income Taxes   ( ASC 740 ),
which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial
statement and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences for those differences,
which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized
for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Income
Taxes (continued)   

ASC
740 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in
the financial statements. Under ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is
more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position would be measured based on
the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance
on de-recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities,
and accounting for interest and penalties associated with these tax positions. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company did not have any liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.  

The
income tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate are summarized as follows:  

United
States    

The
Company is subject to United States tax at graduated rates from 15% to 35%. No provision for income taxes in the United States
has been made as the Company had no U.S. taxable income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

BVI    

World
Win is incorporated in the BVI and is governed by the income tax laws of the BVI. According to current BVI income tax law, the
applicable income tax rate for the Company is 0%.

    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Income
Taxes (continued)   

PRC    

Shenzhen
Wonhe and Shengshihe Consulting are subject to an Enterprise Income Tax at 25% and each file their own tax returns. Consolidated
tax returns are not permitted in China. On July 23, 2012, the National Tax Bureau, Shenzhen Nanshan Branch declared that Shenzhen
Wonhe is qualified for the preferential tax treatment afforded by the PRC to enterprises engaged in the development of software
or integrated circuits. As a result, starting from its first profitable year, Shenzhen Wonhe had a two-year exemption from the
Enterprise Income Tax and has a 50% exemption for the next three years commencing January 1, 2014. The tax regulations required
that the enterprise pay income tax until its eligibility for the exemption is determined - i.e. until the local tax bureau determines
that the enterprise has recorded its first profitable year. Payments were made of approximately $2,600,000 (RMB 16,107,000) based
upon 2012 income while the local tax bureau reviewed the Company s financial results. The National Tax Bureau determined
that the Company had realized a profit in 2012. Since the Company was declared exempt from tax with respect to 2012, the payments
that were made will be applied to future income taxes due. The payments have been reflected as prepaid income taxes on the balance
sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, the eligibility for the 50% tax exemption had expired.
From July 1, 2016, the Company will be required to pay 25% Enterprise Income Tax in full without any tax exemption. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company offset the income tax provision of $188,707 and $309,417, respectively,
and $1,003,702 and $1,045,118, respectively, leaving a balance of prepaid income taxes of $146,296 on September 30, 2016.  

Noncontrolling
Interests   

The
noncontrolling interest in Wonhe Multimedia is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. The noncontrolling interest
is measured at its carrying value in the stockholders  equity section of the consolidated balance sheets.  

Net
Income (Loss) Per Share    

The
Company computes net income (loss) per common share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,   Earnings Per Share   ( ASC
260 ). Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net income per common share is computed by dividing the amount available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income per
common share is computed by dividing the amount available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding plus the effect of any dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Accordingly, the number of weighted average
shares outstanding as well as the amount of net income per share are presented for basic and diluted per share calculations for
the period reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income. There were no dilutive
shares outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

       Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards    

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments. This ASU addresses the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment
costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from
the settlement of certain insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows.  

In
June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The
new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through
an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company
beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting
guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
May, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,
which is an amendment to ASU No. 2014-09 that clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion, to allow entities to exclude
amounts collected from customers from all sales taxes from the transaction price, to specify the measurement date for noncash
consideration is contract inception, variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other
than the form of the consideration, and clarification on contract modifications at transition. The implementation guidelines follow
ASU No. 2014-09.  

In
April, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,
which is an amendment to ASU No. 2014-09 that clarifies the aspects of identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementing
guidance, while retaining the related principles within those areas. The implementation guidelines follow ASU No. 2014-09.  

In
March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
Revenue Gross versus net), which is an amendment to ASU No. 2014-09 that improved the operability and understandability of implementation
guidance versus agent considerations by clarifying the determination of principal versus agent. The implementation guidelines
follow ASU No. 2014-09.

       Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards     (continued)    

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic
815). ASU 2016-06 clarifies that determining whether the economic characteristics of a put or call are clearly and closely related
to its debt host requires only an assessment of the four-step decision sequence outlined in FASB ASC paragraph 815-15-25-24. Additionally,
entities are not required to separately assess whether the contingency itself is clearly and closely related. The standard is
effective for public business entities in interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
adoption is permitted in any interim period for which the entity s financial statements have not been issued, but would
be retroactively applied to the beginning of the year that includes the interim period. The standard requires a modified retrospective
transition approach, with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. For instruments
that are eligible for the fair value option, an entity has a one-time option to irrevocably elect to measure the debt instrument
affected by the standard in its entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The Company does not
expect the application of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations
or Consolidated Statements of Condition.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition
to the Equity Method of Accounting. This new guidance effectively removes the retroactive application imposed in current guidance
when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree
of influence. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the
investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of
the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The new standard becomes effective for the Company on
January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permissible. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material
impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

In
March 2016, the FASB Issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting. The updated guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees,
including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification
in the statement of cash flows. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, with early application
permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU )
model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer
than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense
recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and
operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
statements, with certain practical expedients available. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact
on the Company s financial statements.

       commitments
    (    continued)    

Other
than the salary and necessary social benefits required by the government, which are defined in the employment agreements, we currently
do not provide other benefits to the officers at this time. Other than government severance payments, our executive officers are
not entitled to severance payments upon the termination of their employment agreements or following a change in control.  

PRC
employment law requires an employee be paid severance pay based on the number of years worked with the employer at the rate of
one month s wage for each full year worked. Any period of more than six months but less than one year shall be counted as
one year. The severance pay payable to an employee for any period of less than six months shall be one-half of his monthly
wages. The monthly salary mentioned above is defined as the average salary of 12 months before revocation or termination of the
employment contract.  

Strategic
Cooperation Agreement   

In
April 2015, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Shenzhen Yunlutong Technology Co., Ltd ( YLT ),
which is owned by one of the Company s directors, who owns 4.87% of the Company s common stock. The agreement expires
in three years. Under the agreement, YLT shall purchase 662,000 commercial routers from Shenzhen WONHE, with 200,000 purchased
during the first year, 220,000 during the second year and 242,000 during the third year, for a total purchase price of RMB 926,800,000
(US $148,566,040). Any change in share ownership of YLT shall be approved by Shenzhen Wonhe. In addition, Shenzhen Wonhe obtained
an exclusive right to acquire YLT if its gross annual revenues reach RMB 150,000,000 (US $24,480,000) and net annual profit reaches
RMB 12,500,000 (US $2,040,000) during the term of the agreement. YLT agreed not to sell any equity or issue any debt during the
3 years. The price of the acquisition shall be established by an independent appraiser. The Company produced approximately $5,145,000
and $13,403,000 in sales with YLT for the three and nine months ended September 31, 2016.

       RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

From
time to time, a stockholder/officer loans money to the Company, primarily to meet the non-RMB cash requirements of the parent
and its subsidiaries. The loans are non-interest bearing, and the balance due was $408,996 and $335,655 at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

The
proceeds of the loans were principally used to pay professional and legal fees incurred in the U.S. and other operating expenses
for Wonhe High-Tech and Shengshihe Consulting incurred since their inception. The balance is reflected as loan from stockholder.  

8 .    
       sale
    of Common stock    

In
April 2015, Wonhe High-Tech International, Inc. sold 20,130,000 shares of common stock to 21 unrelated individuals, three individuals
who were shareholders of Shenzhen Wonhe at the time, and three unrelated companies in a private offering in the PRC. The purchase
price for the shares was approximately RMB 4.72 (US $0.77) per share, or a total of RMB 93,000,600 (US $15,196,298). The shares
were sold to accredited investors for their own accounts. The offering was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of
1933 pursuant to Section 4(2) and Section 4(5) of the Securities Act. The offering was also sold in compliance with the exemption
from registration provided by Regulation S, as all of the purchasers were residents of the People s Republic of China.

       sale
    of Common stock (    continued)    

Of
the 20,130,000 shares sold, 4,600,000 (22.7%) were sold to two directors and one officer/director of the Company. On the date
of sale, the Company s common stock was quoted on the OTCQB at $3.07 per share. Since over 75% of the shares in this offering
were sold to unrelated parties at $0.77 per share, and no shares of the Company s common stock were traded on the OTCQB
from January 1, 2015 to April 22, 2015, the Company believes that the sales price of $0.77 was more representative of the fair
value per share than the ORCQB price of $3.07. As a result, management believes that the $0.77 per share was a fair price and
recorded no compensation related to the share sold to the officer and directors of the Company.  

On
April 19, 2016 the Company sold a total of 15,000,000 shares of common stock to two investors in a private offering. Qing Tong,
a member of the Registrant s board of directors, purchased 3,000,000 shares. The remaining 12,000,000 shares were purchased
by an unaffiliated entity. The purchase price for the shares was 0.52 Renminbi (approx. $.08) per share, or a total of 7,800,000
Renminbi (approx. $1,200,000).  

The
shares were sold to investors who are accredited investors and were purchasing for their own accounts. The offering, therefore,
was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 4(2) and Section 4(5) of the Securities Act.
The offering was also sold in compliance with the exemption from registration provided by Regulation S, as all of the purchasers
were residents of the People s Republic of China.

       Cash
    Dividends    

On
September 30, 2016, the Board of Directors of Wonhe Multimedia Commerce Ltd., in which Wonhe High-Tech indirectly owns a 53.3%
interest, declared a cash dividend of AUD $0.004857 per share, for a total dividend of AUD$637,190 (approximately USD$486,498).
The dividend payment was made to the shareholders of Wonhe Multimedia Commerce Ltd. subsequent to the third quarter.  

The
Company is required to file income tax returns in both the United States and the PRC. Its operations in the United States have
been insignificant and income taxes have not been accrued. In the PRC, the Company files tax returns for Shenzhen Wonhe and Shengshihe
Consulting.  

The
provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of the following for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and

The
following is a reconciliation of the statutory rate with the effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.  

The
following presents the aggregate dollar and per share effects of the Company s subsidiaries/VIE tax holidays:  

The
Company s PRC tax filings for the tax years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were examined by the tax authorities. The examinations
were completed and resulted in no adjustments.

       Income
    taxes     (continued)    

The
Company did not file its U.S. federal income tax returns, including, without limitation, information returns on Internal Revenue
Service ( IRS ) Form 5471,   Information Return of U.S. Persons with Respect to Certain Foreign Corporations 
 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the six month period ended December 31, 2012, a short year income tax return required
to be filed as a result of the change in the fiscal year and the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Failure to furnish
any income tax and information returns with respect to any foreign business entity required, within the time prescribed by the
IRS, subjects the Company to civil penalties. Management is of the opinion that penalties, if any, that may be assessed would
not be material to the consolidated financial statements.  

Because
the Company did not generate any income in the United States or otherwise have any U.S. taxable income, the Company does not believe
that it has any U.S. federal income tax liabilities with respect to any transactions that the Company or any of its subsidiaries
may have engaged in through December 31, 2015. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this position,
and therefore the Company ultimately could be liable for U.S. federal income taxes, interest and penalties. The tax year ended
June 30, 2012, six-month tax period ended December 31, 2012, and the tax years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 remain open
to examination by the IRS.  

All
of the Company s operations are conducted in the PRC. At September 30, 2016, the Company s unremitted foreign earnings
of its PRC subsidiaries totaled approximately $19.2 million and the Company held approximately $46.2 million of cash and cash
equivalents in the PRC. These unremitted earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely into the operations of the Company
in the PRC. While repatriation of cash held in the PRC may be restricted by local PRC laws, most of the Company s foreign
cash balances could be repatriated to the United States but, under current U.S. income tax laws, would be subject to U.S. federal
income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability
on the unremitted earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation, and as
the Company does not plan to repatriate any cash in the PRC to the United States during the foreseeable future, no deferred tax
liability has been accrued.  

As
disclosed in Note 10, the Company was delinquent in filing certain tax returns with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Company
is unable to determine the amount of penalties, if any, that may be assessed at this time. Management is of the opinion that penalties,
if any, that may be assessed would not be material to the consolidated financial statements.  

The
Company did not file the information reports for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, concerning its interest
in foreign bank accounts on form TDF 90-22.1,  Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts  ( FBAR ).
Not complying with the FBAR reporting and recordkeeping requirements will subject the Company to civil penalties up to $10,000
for each of its foreign bank accounts. The Company has not determined the amount of any penalties that may be assessed at this
time and believes that penalties, if any, that may be assessed would not be material to the consolidated financial statements.

       INVESTMENT
    IN PROJECT     

On
January 12, 2016 the Company s operating subsidiary, Shenzhen Wonhe Technology Co., Ltd. ( Shenzhen Wonhe ),
entered into an agreement titled  Wireless Network Coverage Project in Beijing Area  with Guangdong Kesheng Enterprise
Co., Ltd. ( Guangdong Kesheng ). The agreement contemplates that the two parties will work together to develop a wireless
network in certain designated areas of Beijing. The commercial purpose of the network will be to serve as a vehicle for advertising
and marketing, with the revenue to be shared between Shenzhen Wonhe and Guangdong Kesheng.  

Shenzhen
Wonhe has committed in the agreement to provide 382,990,000 RMB (USD $57.42 million), including 226,010,000 RMB (USD $33.88 million)
in cash and 118,980,000 RMB (USD $17.84 million) in routers and other equipment. Shenzhen Wonhe will also contribute the network
that it developed in the Tongzhou District of Beijing as a pilot project, at a cost of 38,000,000 RMB (USD $5.70 million). Shenzhen
Wonhe s cash contribution will be paid over three years: 104,498,990 RMB in 2016, 84,636,558 RMB in 2017 and 36,871,412
RMB in 2018. Shenzhen Wonhe has also committed to develop the data systems that will be used by the network. Guangdong Kesheng
has committed to supervise the engineering and construction, coordinate relationships with local government, and manage the network s
operations. As of September 30, 2016, USD$23,360,531 had been contributed to the project.  

Prior
to signing the official investment contract, the Company invested RMB38,000,000 (USD $5.70 million) to develop a network station
in one of the contracted  Wireless Network Coverage Project  locations, the Tongzhou District of Beijing, as a pilot
project. As of September 30, 2016, total payments for the pilot project were included in  investment in project  in
the consolidated balance sheet.  

On
October 31 2016, Wonhe Multimedia Commerce Ltd., the Company s 53.3%-owned Australian subsidiary, paid the dividend of AUD
$637,190 (approximately USD$486,000) declared on September 30, 2016.  

On November 1, 2016, the Company
renewed the employment agreements with Nanfang Tong and with Qing Tong for a three year period that expires on October 31, 2019. 

ITEM
    2    
       MANAGEMENT S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

On
May 30, 2012, Shengshihe Consulting, a subsidiary of Wonhe High-Tech International, Inc. (the  Company ) and Shenzhen
Wonhe and its shareholders, Youliang Wang, Qing Tong, Jingwu Li and Nanfang Tong (together referred to as  Shenzhen Wonhe
Shareholders ) entered into a series of agreements known as variable interest agreements (the  VIE Agreements )
pursuant to which Shenzhen Wonhe became Shengshihe Consulting s contractually controlled affiliate. The accounting effect
of the VIE Agreements between Shengshihe Consulting and Shenzhen Wonhe required the balance sheets and financial results of Shenzhen
Wonhe to be consolidated with those of Shengshihe Consulting, with respect to which Shenzhen Wonhe was a variable interest entity.
Since the entities that were parties to the VIE Agreements were under common control at the time when the VIE Agreements were
executed, the financial statements included in this report reflect the consolidation of the results of operations and cash flows
of Shenzhen Wonhe since inception.  

On
September 15, 2015, Shengshihe Consulting exercised its option to purchase all of the registered equity of Shenzhen Wonhe. The
purchase price paid for the equity was RMB10,000 (approximately $1,540). The equity was purchased from the Shenzhen Wonhe Shareholders,
each of whom is a member of the Company s Board of Directors. As a result of that purchase, since September 15, 2015, 100%
of the financial results of Shenzhen Wonhe have been consolidated as a subsidiary of Shengshihe Consulting.  

In
July 2015, World Win International Holdings Ltd. ( World Win ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wonhe High-Tech, organized
Wonhe Multimedia Commerce Ltd. ( Australian Wonhe ) under Australian law. 60% of the capital stock of Australian Wonhe
was issued to World Win, 25% was issued to Wonhe International (Hong Kong), which is wholly owned and controlled by Qing Tong,
who is Chairman of the Board of the Company. The remaining 15% was issued to three non-affiliated financial consultants. On August
5, 2015, World Win sold all of the outstanding capital stock of Kuayu International Holdings Group Limited ( Kuayu )
to Australian Wonhe. In exchange for Kuayu, Australian Wonhe paid World Win $10,000 Hong Kong Dollars (USD $1,290).  

Kuayu
is the sole owner of Shengshihe Consulting, which in turn has owned our operating company, Shenzhen Wonhe, since September 15,
2015. The effect of the sale of Kuayu, therefore, was to reduce the Company s interest in its operating entity by 40%. The
40% reduction in ownership of Kuayu was recognized as compensation valued at $7,534,080 to the chairman of the board and the financial
consultants during the year ended December 31, 2015.  

On
December 21, 2015, our 60% owned subsidiary, Australia Wonhe, was listed on the ASX, and raised capital selling 16,951,802 shares
for $0.20 AUD for a total of AUD $3,390,360 (USD $2,436,449) and received net proceeds of approximately AUD $2,701,000 (USD $1,941,000).
As a result of the capital raise, our ownership interest in Australian Wonhe was reduced to 53.3%.  

Shenzhen
Wonhe is a Chinese entity established on November 16, 2010, with registered capital of $7,495,000. It specializes in the research
and development, outsourced-manufacturing and sale of hi-tech products based on x86 (instruction set architecture based on the
Intel 8086 CPU) and ARM (32-bit reduced instruction set architecture). Since December 2011, Shenzhen Wonhe has marketed a series
of home media centers, it introduced its current product, HMC720, in the fourth quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015,
Shenzhen Wonhe introduced its first Wi-Fi Router, model number YLT-100S, followed by model number YLT-300S in the second quarter
of 2015. Current products still under research and development include a Smart Media Box (SMB), Home Smart Server (HSS), Mini
PC (MPC), All in One PC (AIO-PC), Business PAD (B-PAD), and Portable PAD (P-PAD).  

Results
of Operations   

The
following table sets forth in U.S. dollars, key components of our results of operations during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Sales  .  

On
October 15, 2014, our second generation home media center, the HMC720, passed its stability test, which was the final pre-requisite
before we could introduce it to the market. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we commenced sales of the HMC720 at a unit selling
price of $514. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our sales of HMC 720 remained stable at $6,512,593 and $18,820,901,
respectively, compared to sales of HMC 720 of $6,287,865 and $18,720,527 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

In
March 2015, we expanded our product offerings to include a line of  Wifi Routers.  Our initial product, the YLT-100S,
is designed for home use. The unit s selling price (including 3% VAT) is RMB 369 (US$56). In June 2015 we introduced a second
Wifi Router, the YLT-300S, which is designed to be used in large commercial networks. The unit selling price of the YLT-300S (including
3% VAT) is RMB 1,400 (US$213). As with our home media center, we do not manufacture the routers, all manufacturing of the Wifi
Routers is outsourced. Sales of router YLT-100S were $698,564 and $2,032,090 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, respectively. Sales of router YLT-300S were $4,994,946 and $13,011,882 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, respectively.  

Gross
Profit.   Although our sales increased quarter-to-quarter, by 52.8% our gross profit increased by only 17.2%, from $3,361,916
in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $3,940,888 in the three months ended September 30, 2016. Similarly, our sales
increased by 58.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and our gross profit
increased by only 15.9% from $9,670,603 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $11,210,279 in the nine months ended September
30, 2016. This discrepancy occurred primarily because our cost of goods for routers was a significantly higher percentage of the
sales price than our cost of goods for our home entertainment centers. As routers represent a larger portion of our overall business,
our gross margins are likely to fall. The potential market for our routers is large, however. So our diversification into the
router market makes bottom-line sense, even if our gross margins become diminished.  

Income
from Operations.   Our operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $626,964 and
$1,755,592, respectively, from $8,413,754 and $8,901,945, respectively, incurred in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015. The primary reason for the decrease was the $7,534,000 in compensation to our chairman of the board and financial consultants
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 that we recorded as a result of the transfer of our subsidiary Kuayu to
an entity in which those individuals owned 40% of the equity.  

The
components of our operating expenses were:  

General
and administrative expenses are also affected by changes in employees  remuneration. Shenzhen Wonhe is required to make
contributions to multi-employer welfare programs by government regulation, sometimes identified as the Mainland China Contribution
Plan. Specifically, the following regulations require that we pay a percentage of employee salaries into the specified plans:

      Depending on their position in the Company, employees
receive either hospitalization medical and maternity insurance or comprehensive medical and maternity insurance, which is a lower
premium.   

Our
contributions are proportionate to salaries paid. Therefore, as labor rates in China have increased significantly in recent years
and can be expected to continue to increase, those increases cause an increase in the amount we pay to employee welfare plans.  

After
deducting these operating expenses, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the company realized income (loss)
from operations of $3,313,924 and $(5,051,838), respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we realized
income from operations of $9,454,687 and $768,658, respectively.  

Other
Income (Expense).   The components of our non-operating income and expense during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were:  

We
                                         recorded a loss of $54,404 on write-off of leasehold improvements when we moved our offices
                                         during the third quarter of 2015.    

Provision
for Income Taxes  . In 2013, our operating entity received preferential tax treatment from the PRC State Administration
of Taxation. Shenzhen Wonhe was awarded a two-year exemption from the Enterprise Income Tax followed by a three year 50% reduction
in its Enterprise Income Tax rate. On May 10, 2013, we were informed by the local tax bureau that the income tax previously paid
as of the date of notification of RMB 16,107,114 ($2,615,795) could be offset against our future income taxes after the tax exemption
period.  

The
Company s 100% Income Tax exemption expired on December 31, 2013. As of June 30, 2016, our eligibility for the 50% tax exemption
had expired. From July 1, 2016, the Company will be subject to the 25% Enterprise Income Tax in full without any tax exemption.
As a result, tax provisions, after the 25% deduction, of $883,926 and $(311,426), respectively, $1,698,921 and $1,051,267, respectively,
were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which were offset against the prepaid income tax
described above.  

Net
Income  . We reported net income (loss) of $2,529,392 and $(5,377,720), respectively, for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, and $8,023,807 and $(215,393), respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The VIE
agreements, which were terminated on September 15, 2015, assigned to Shengshihe Consulting only 95% of the net profit generated
from Shenzhen Wonhe before September 15, 2015. In addition, for all periods after August 5, 2015, our interest in Australian Wonhe
has been reduced by a non-controlling interest (40% from September 15, 2015 to December 21, 2015, and 46.7% thereafter). For that
reason, we reduced our net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 by an allocation to the  non-controlling
interests  of $1,192,900 and $(661,853), respectively, and by an allocation of $3,782,143 and $(919,348), respectively,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, before recognizing net income (loss) attributable to the common stockholders.
After those allocations, our net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was $1,336,492 ($0.02 per share) and $(6,039,573) ($(0.10) per share), respectively, and for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was $4,242,664 ($0.06 per share) and $(1,134,741) ($(0.02) per share), respectively.  

Foreign
Currency Translation Adjustment.   Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our local currency, Renminbi (RMB), is our
functional currency. Results of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets
and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate as quoted by the People s Bank of China at the end of the period.
Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the statement
of stockholders  equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated
in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. For the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency translation adjustments of $209,449 and $(2,354,088), respectively,
$(1,396,779) and $(2,191,963), respectively, have been reported as other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements
of operations and other comprehensive income (loss). The reason for the significant increase in the translation adjustment was
the devaluation of the RMB by approximately 3.5% in August 2015, followed by a devaluation of approximately 1% in January 2016.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

To
date, we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations, sales of common stock and equity contributions
by our shareholders. As a result, at September 30, 2016, our only debt consisted of $408,996 that we have borrowed from a stockholder,
primarily in order to obtain U.S. and Australian Dollars to pay the professional and other expenses of our parent corporation
and Australian subsidiary. At September 30, 2016,  our working capital totaled $47,399,570,
a decrease of $7,567,996 since December  31, 2015 . The decrease occurred because we
utilized $16,789,227 to meet our obligation to fund our wireless network joint venture with Guangdong Kesheng.    

Our
  cash and cash equivalents of $43,903,921 primarily
consist of cash on hand and demand deposits.  Our ability to repatriate those amounts to
the United States will be limited by the factors discussed below in  Restrictions on Transfer of Funds.    

In
addition to cash and cash equivalents, our working capital included $5,101,893 in accounts receivable. This represented approximately
42% of our sales for the recent quarter, and represented an increase of $1,455,986 from our accounts receivable balance at the
end of 2015. All accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 have been subsequently collected.  

The
following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:  

Operating
activities    

Our
operations provided $8,363,984 in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash provided by operations was approximately
equal to our net income before non-controlling interest of $8,023,807 for the period. Net income and cash provided were approximately
equal because the increase in accounts receivable of $1,456,406 was offset, as we used $1,018,182 of our prepaid income taxes
to satisfy our tax liability and incurred a non-cash depreciation expense of $180,570. Cash from operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was $8,791,626, primarily because our net loss of $215,393 in that period was caused by non-cash stock
compensation valued at $7,534,080. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we used $714,605 in prepaid taxes
and reduced our accounts receivable by $535,864. Since we purchase the HMC720 and Wifi Routers from our outsourced manufacturers,
mostly on the basis of orders received from distributors, we generally carry only nominal amounts of inventory. Our ability to
utilize contract manufacturers in this manner allows us to operate without devoting significant amounts of cash to inventory,
which will aid our cash flow in the future.  

Investing
activities    

Because
we outsource all of our manufacturing operations, we require little cash for investment in property and equipment. So the cash
flows from our core operations can be dedicated to working capital. For example, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
we used $4,520 to purchase equipment, vehicles and intangible assets. However, during that same period we also contributed $16,789,227
in cash to the Wireless Network Coverage Project in Beijing Area that we are implementing under our contract with Guangdong Kesheng
Enterprise Co., Ltd. Under the terms of that contract, we will be responsible for a total cash investment of $34.37 million and
for providing routers valued at $18.09 million. As compensation, we will have a fixed return from the advertising revenue generated
by the project. As a result, the expenditure to date of $23,360,531 has been classified on our balance sheets as an investment
in the project. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we used $1,911,743 to purchase equipment, vehicles and intangible
assets to be used in the wireless network pilot project that we carried out in anticipation of our joint venture with Guangdong
Kesheng. In addition, we also spent $1,569 to acquire ownership of Shenzhen Wonhe and eliminate the VIE structure; and received
$1,290 from sales of our subsidiary s stock.  

Financing
activities    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 15,000,000 common shares and raised fund of $1,204,320. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, we issued 20,130,000 common shares and raised $15,196,298. We believe that our cash on hand and cash
flow from operations will meet our cash needs for the next 12 months.  

Restrictions
on Transfers of Funds    

Almost
all of the Company s cash is in the PRC. Any distributions of those funds or future operating profits from our Chinese subsidiaries,
Shengshihe Consulting and Shenzhen Wonhe, to our U.S. parent company must comply with applicable Chinese laws affecting payments
from Chinese companies to non-Chinese companies. The Chinese government strictly regulates conversion of RMB into foreign currencies.
Currently, Shenzhen Wonhe and Shengshihe Consulting may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions,
including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ),
by complying with certain procedural requirements. Pursuant to applicable Chinese laws and regulations, foreign invested enterprises
incorporated in China, such as Shengshihe Consulting, are required to apply for  Foreign Exchange Registration Certificates. 
Currently, conversion within the scope of the  current account  (e.g. remittance of foreign currencies for payment
of dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, etc.) can be effected without requiring the approval of
SAFE, but must be effected through authorized Chinese banks in accordance with regulatory procedures. However, conversion of currency
in the  capital account  (e.g. for capital items such as direct investments, loans, securities, etc.) still requires
the approval of SAFE. Compliance with those procedural requirements can result in delays in currency conversion, which could interfere
with offshore activities by the Company, such as acquisitions, offshore investments, or the payment of dividends to the Company s
shareholders. Because of the effort involved in obtaining foreign currencies in exchange for RMB, the Company intends to pay most
of the operating expenses of its U.S. parent from dollars loaned to the Company by related parties.  

Shenzhen
Wonhe is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated profits, if any, each year to fund the statutory general reserve
until the reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Any amount in excess of 10% of accumulated profits that is contributed
to the statutory general reserve is at Shenzhen Wonhe s discretion. The statutory general reserve is not distributable in
the form of cash dividends to the Company and can be used to make up cumulative prior year losses, if any, and may be converted
into share capital by the issue of new shares to shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings, or by increasing
the par value of the shares currently held by them, provided that the reserve balance after such issue is not less than 25% of
the registered capital. As of September 30, 2016, $2,123,887 has been appropriated from retained earnings and set aside for the
statutory reserve by Shenzhen Wonhe.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

In
preparing our financial statements we are required to formulate accounting policies regarding valuation of our assets and liabilities
and to develop estimates of those values. In our preparation of the financial statements for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, there were no estimates made which were (a) subject to a high degree of uncertainty and (b) material to our results.  

Impact
of Accounting Pronouncements   

There
were no recent accounting pronouncements that have or will have a material effect on the Company s financial position or
results of operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

ITEM 4.   
       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission) as of September 30, 2016. The evaluation revealed that there are material weaknesses in our disclosure
controls, specifically:  

The
                                         relatively small number of employees who are responsible for accounting functions prevents
                                         us from segregating duties within our internal control system.    

Our
                                         internal financial staff lack expertise in identifying and addressing complex accounting
                                         issued under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.    

Our
                                         Chief Financial Officer is not familiar with the accounting and reporting requirements
                                         of a U.S. public company.    

We
                                         have not developed sufficient documentation concerning our existing financial processes,
                                         risk assessment and internal controls.    

Based
on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s system of disclosure
controls and procedures was not effective as of September 30, 2016.  

It
is our intention to increase staffing to mitigate the current lack of segregation of duties within the general administrative
and financial functions. In an effort to remediate the material weaknesses, we plan to document our process and procedures governing
our internal reporting, including (1) timely review of reports prior to issuance, (2) a re-evaluation of our staffing needs, and
(3) analysis of unusual transactions as they are occurring to allow adequate time for multiple levels of review.  

In
addition, we plan to designate individuals responsible for identifying reportable developments and to implement procedures designed
to remediate the material weakness by focusing additional attention and resources on our internal accounting functions. However,
the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period
of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
