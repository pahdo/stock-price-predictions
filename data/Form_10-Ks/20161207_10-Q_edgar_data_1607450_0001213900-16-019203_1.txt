NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN   

(A)
Organization    

ABV
Consulting, Inc. ( The Company ) was originally organized in the State of Nevada on October 15, 2013. The Company
provides merchandising and consulting services to Craft beer brewers and distributors as well as providing marketing support within
the craft beer industry to retailers and other organizations as needed. While the Company does not directly produce alcoholic
beverages, it provides services to help businesses in the industry improve their marketing, sales and operations.  

(B)
Going Concern    

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $154,884 and used cash in operations of $33,699 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. Losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for professional
fees and general and administrative expenses associated with our operations.  

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed unaudited
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Management
believes that the actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plan provides the opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern.  

(C)
Basis of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in The United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial
information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position
and results of operations. The interim results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results
for the full fiscal year. It is management s opinion, however that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statements presentation.  

(D)
Risks and Uncertainties    

The
Company is a business whose planned principal operations is to provide merchandising and consulting services to the Craft beer
brewers and distributors as well as providing marketing support within the craft beer industry. The Company is currently conducting
research and development activities to operationalize certain high-risk environments.  

During
the last year, the Company has continued to communicate with breweries, retailers and other key players in the industry and increasing
our online presence through our blog, Facebook and twitter pages. The Company also continues to seek additional funding to continue
to expand our presence in the industry.  

The
Company's activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure any consulting agreements
and additional funding.  

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

(A)
Cash and Cash Equivalents    

The
Company considers investments that have original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  

(B)
Use of Estimates in Financial Statements    

The
presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates during the periods covered
by these financial statements include the valuation of deferred tax asset and imputed compensation costs.

  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

  (UNAUDITED)  

(C)
Fair value measurements and Fair value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods
for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.  

Level
2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data.  

Level
3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.  

(D)
Revenue Recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC No. 605,  Revenue Recognition . In all
cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, 100% of the Company s revenues was received from one customer.  

(E)
Segments    

The
Company operates in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented.  

(F)
Loss Per Share    

The
basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares during the period. The diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net loss available
to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average
number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. As of
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the company has no dilutive securities.  

(G)
Income Taxes    

The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ). Under ASC 740-10-25, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.   

(H)
Reclassification    

Certain
amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation  

NOTE
3   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize
(i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted
basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of,
a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors;
however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We
are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash
flows or financial condition.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

  (UNAUDITED)  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting , which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of
the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions
of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 10 Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments
in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation
guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts
with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity s promise
to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied
at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments
in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement
necessary to comply with Topic 606. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact
on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

No
other accounting pronouncements issued by FASB (including the Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC, did not or are
not believed by the Company management, to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements.

NOTE
4   NOTE PAYABLE   

On
May 24, 2016 the Company borrowed $12,500 from an unrelated third party pursuant to the terms of non-interest bearing, unsecured
promissory note issued by the Company. The proceeds of the loan will be used for expenses to be incurred by the Company for filing
an application and payment of listing fees for the listing of its common stock on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets. The principal
amount of the loan will become due in full in the event the Company s controlling shareholder fails to enter into an agreement
to sell his shares to a third party or upon a breach by any such shareholder under the terms of such agreement (the  Maturity
Date ). In the event the Company does not faithfully, and punctually perform all of its obligations under the terms of the
promissory note, the lender may, at its option, (i) declare the entire unpaid principal balance of the promissory note together
with accrued and unpaid interest at the highest lawful rate immediately due and payable; and (ii) pursue any other remedy available
to lender at law or in equity. On August 22, 2016, the Former Chief Executive Officer repaid the promissory note in the amount
of $12,500.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

This
report contains forward-looking statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward-looking
information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions.
This report and other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking statements that
set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions regarding future events or performance. We have
tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as  anticipate,   estimate, 
 expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe,   will 
and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
statements relating to future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts, expenses, the outcome
of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Factors that could cause our actual results of operations
and financial condition to differ materially are discussed in greater detail in the  Risk Factors  section of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 23, 2016.   

We
caution that the factors described herein and other factors could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition
to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we make and that investors should not place undue
reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such
statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after
the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances.
New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot assess
the impact of each such factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  

The
Company    

Plan
of Operations   

ABV
Consulting, Inc. (the  Company ) is in the business of providing merchandising and consulting services to Craft beer
brewers and distributors, as well as providing additional marketing support within the craft beer industry to retailers and other
organizations as needed. While we do not directly produce alcoholic beverages, we provide services to help businesses in the industry
improve their marketing, sales and operations.  

In
March 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with one of the country s oldest craft brewers to assist in the brewery s
marketing strategy. Our efforts during Q2 were primarily focused on providing services to our client under this agreement which
we completed during the second quarter. The Company is currently focused on networking during two industry events in Philadelphia,
PA   the annual Craft Brewers Conference and Philadelphia Beer Week. We have also continued to push our brand via social
media by providing input on key industry issues, and offering marketing and sales support ideas to our Facebook and Twitter followers.

and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the
notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. The results discussed below are for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. For comparative purposes, we are comparing the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s
condensed financial statements and the related notes included in this quarterly report.  

Revenue.
  Service revenue, net was $1,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and $2,000 for the nine month period,
an increase of $1,000 and $2,000 respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. The increases are a result of revenue from
our craft brewing marketing contract. We expect a decrease in revenue in future periods as a result of the expiration of this
agreement.  

Operating
Expenses  . Total operating expenses were $9,891 and $11,624 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015, respectively. Total operating expenses were $44,464 and $38,678 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015, respectively. The decrease during the three month period was a result of lower operating expenses as we refocus our
business operations and the increase in the nine month period was primarily attributable to increases in general and administrative
expenses, partially offset by a reduction in professional fees. We are unable to forecast our future operating expenses as we
continue to attempt to develop our current operations and explore additional business opportunities.  

Interest
Expense  . Interest expense was $0 and $101 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.
Interest expense was $349 and $178 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase
during the three month period is attributable to a reduction in borrowings that occurred upon the change in control in August
2016 and the increase during the nine month period was a result of increases in shareholder loans in prior periods.  

Net
Loss  . The net loss was $8,891 and $11,725 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.
The net loss was $42,813 and $38,856 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease
in the three month period is a result of the decrease in operating expenses and interest expenses, partially offset by an increase
in service revenue, net discussed above. The increase in the nine-month period is a result of the increase in operating expenses
and Interest Expenses, partially offset by an increase in service revenue, net discussed above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of September
30, 2016, our working capital amounted to $(10,163), a decrease of $6,298 as compared to working capital of $3,865, as of December
31, 2015. This decrease is primarily a result of an increase in accounts payable and a reduction in cash. Working capital deficit
consisted of accounts payable of $10,163.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $33,699 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $45,977 in the
nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The reduction in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to an
increase in accounts payable and accrued interest, partially offset by an increase in net loss.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $25,186 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $20,000 in
the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash provided by financing activities is a result of capital contributions
and the proceeds from a note payment, partially offset by a decrease in related party notes.  

Plan
of Operation and Funding   

We
expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through further issuances of our securities and loans from
our principal shareholders. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.  

Existing
cash, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are not expected to be adequate to fund our operations
over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations
to date through the proceeds of the sales of equity and shareholder loans. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates
additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a
start-up business; and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and
debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating
requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders.
Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not
be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we
may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially
restrict our business operations.  

Going
Concern Consideration   

We
have incurred significant losses since our inception on October 15, 2013. We had a net loss from operation during the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016 of $42,813 and an accumulated deficit of $154,884 as of September 30, 2016. This raises substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent our ability to
raise additional capital and generate additional revenues and profits from our business plan.  

In
the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, our auditor included
a statement that as a result of these conditions, there is a substantial doubt as our ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Inflation   

In
the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations in the immediate future. Management
will continue to monitor inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business and operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

Under
SEC regulations, we are required to disclose our off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. As of September 30, 2016, we have no off-balance
sheet arrangements that meet such criterion.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Our
significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of our Condensed Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this Item 3.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange
Act ) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer, CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 for the reasons discussed below.  

Management
identified the following material weakness and significant deficiencies in its assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls
and procedures as of September 30, 2016:  

Material
    Weakness   The Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because
    we lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure
    that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.   

Significant
    Deficiencies   Inadequate segregation of duties.   

We
expect to be materially dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future.
Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the
material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures will not result in errors in our financial
statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements.  

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control   

There
were no changes identified in connection with our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION

proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered
or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
