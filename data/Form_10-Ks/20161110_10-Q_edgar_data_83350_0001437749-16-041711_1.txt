   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
     
  September 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

Note 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
     
  The accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements, the unaudited interim financial statements and these notes, have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, certain disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been omitted. The accompanying financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
  In the opinion of Management, the accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals), which are necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the current interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.     
     
  Note 2   OTHER INCOME/(LOSS), NET  
     
  The following is an analysis of the components of Other Income/(Loss), Net:  

Note 3   INVESTMENTS AND RELATED COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, INCLUDING GUARANTEES  
     
  The Company s Equity Investments include a 33% ownership interest in Broadway Sixty-Eight, Ltd. (the  Partnership ), an Oklahoma limited partnership, which owns and operates an office building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Although the Company invested as a limited partner, it agreed, jointly and severally, with all other limited partners to reimburse the general partner for any losses suffered from operating the Partnership. The indemnity agreement provides no limitation to the maximum potential future payments. To date, no monies have been paid with respect to this agreement.  
     
  The Company s Equity Investments also include a 47% ownership in Grand Woods Development, LLC (the  LLC ) an Oklahoma limited liability company acquired in November 2015. The LLC owns approximately 26.3 acres of undeveloped real estate in northeast Oklahoma City. The Company has guaranteed a loan for which the proceeds were used to purchase a portion of the undeveloped real estate acreage.

Note 4   PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES   
     
  In 2016 and 2015, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate, primarily as a result of allowable depletion for tax purposes in excess of the cost basis in oil and gas properties and the corporate graduated tax rate structure.   
     
  Excess federal percentage depletion, which is limited to certain production volumes and by certain income levels, reduces estimated taxable income projected for any year. The federal excess percentage depletion estimates will be updated throughout the year until finalized with the detail well-by-well calculations at year-end. When a provision for income taxes is recorded, federal excess percentage depletion benefits decrease the effective tax rate. When a benefit for income taxes is recorded, federal excess percentage depletion benefits increase the effective tax rate. The benefit of federal excess percentage depletion is not directly related to the amount of pre-tax income recorded in a period. Accordingly, in periods where a recorded pre-tax income is relatively small, the proportional effect of these items on the effective tax rate may be significant.      
     
  Note 5   ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION  
     
  The Company records the fair value of its estimated liability to retire its oil and natural gas producing properties in the period in which it is incurred (typically the date of first sale). The estimated liability is calculated by obtaining current estimated plugging costs from the well operators and inflating it over the life of the property. Current year inflation rate used is 4.08%. When the liability is first recorded, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset is also recorded. Subsequently, the asset is amortized to expense over the life of the property and the liability is increased annually for the change in its present value which is currently 3.25%.  
     
  A reconciliation of the Company s asset retirement obligation liability is as follows:  

Note 6   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
     
  Inputs used to measure fair value are organized into a fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs. Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices, for similar assets that are observable. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs.  
     
   Recurring Fair Value Measurements   
     
  Certain of the Company s assets are reported at fair value in the accompanying balance sheets on a recurring basis. The Company determined the fair value of the available-for-sale securities using quoted market prices for securities with similar maturity dates and interest rates. At September   30, 2016 and December   31, 2015, the Company s assets reported at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized as follows:   

6

Non-  R  ecurring Fair Value Measurements   
     
  The Company s asset retirement obligation annually represents a non-recurring fair value liability. The fair value of the non-financial liability incurred in the nine months ended September   30 was $10,855 in 2016 and $22,432 in 2015 and was calculated using Level 3 inputs. See Note 5 above for more information about this liability and the inputs used for calculating fair value.  
     
  The impairment losses of   $508,964 in the nine months ended September   30,   2016, with $2,394,172 for 2015, also represents non-recurring fair value expenses using the income approach and Level 3 inputs. See Note 7 below for a description of the impairment loss calculation.  
     
   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
     
  The Company s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, marketable securities, trade payables and dividends payable. At September   30, 2016 and December   31, 2015, the historical cost of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and dividends payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to the short-term maturities of these items.     
     
  Note 7 -   LONG-LIVED ASSETS IMPAIRMENT LOSS     
    
  Oil and gas producing properties are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that they   are not expected to recover their entire carrying value through future cash flows. The evaluations involve significant judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as inflation rates, future sales prices for oil and gas, future production costs, estimates of future oil and gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The need to test a property for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to oil and gas reserves.   Between periods in which reserves would normally be calculated, the Company updates the reserve calculations utilizing updated estimates of forward crude oil and natural gas prices. The assessment determined no impairment provision was needed for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and an impairment provision of $1,837,438 was needed for the same period in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the assessment resulted in an impairment provision of $508,964 and for the same period in 2015, the impairment provision was $2,394,172. The impairment provisions for both 2016 and 2015 were principally the result of lower projected future prices for oil and gas. A reduction in oil or gas prices, or a decline in reserve volumes, could lead to additional impairment that may be material to the Company.      
     
  Note 8   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  Its objective is to clarify guidance and eliminate diversity in practice of classification on certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this ASU as of January 1, 2017 and believes the adoption of the new guidance will not have a significant effect on its cash flows or disclosures.  
     
  See also the  New Accounting Pronouncements  disclosures on page 25 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Other than ASU 2016-15 discussed above, there were no other accounting pronouncements issued since December 31, 2015 that were directly applicable to the Company or will have any material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.        

ITEM 2.    
 
   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      
     
  This discussion and analysis should be read with reference to a similar discussion in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (hereinafter, the  2015 Form 10-K ), as well as the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.  

7

Forward Looking Statements   
     
  This discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements give the Company s current expectations of future events. They include statements regarding the drilling of oil and gas wells, the production that may be obtained from oil and gas wells, cash flow and anticipated liquidity and expected future expenses.  
     
  Although management believes the expectations in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that would cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under  Forward Looking Statements  on page 8 of the 2015 Form 10-K.  
     
  We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. You are urged to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business.  

Financial Conditions and Results of Operations    
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  Please refer to the Balance Sheets and the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows in this Form 10-Q to supplement the following discussion. In the first nine months of 2016, the Company continued to fund its business activity through the use of internal sources of cash. The Company had cash provided by operations of $1,108,657 and cash provided by the maturities of available-for-sale securities of $8,642,053. Additional cash of $341,395 was provided by property dispositions and an investment distribution for total cash provided of $10,092,105. The Company utilized cash for the purchase of available-for-sale securities of $8,641,014; property additions of $1,267,879; investments activity of $1,030,000; and financing activities of $997,953 for total cash applied of $11,936,846. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $1,844,741 to $12,092,474.  
     
   Discussion of Significant Changes in Working Capital.  In addition to the changes in cash and cash equivalents discussed above, there were other changes in working capital line items from December 31, 2015. A discussion of these items follows.  
     
  Trading securities increased $58,163 (14%) from $410,724 to $468,887. The increase was the result of a $47,764 increase in the trading securities  market value plus $10,399 of net gain from these securities.  
     
  Refundable income taxes increased $71,135 (15%) from $488,052 to $559,187. This increase was due primarily to the estimated current income tax benefit of $70,606 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, plus $529 of state income tax payments.  
     
  Receivables increased $149,208 (23%) to $794,076 from $644,868. This increase was due entirely to higher oil and gas sales receivables. Sales variances are discussed in the  Results of Operations  section below.  
     
  Accounts payable increased $59,738 (26%) to $285,386 from $225,648. This increase was primarily due to an increase in drilling activity at September 30, 2016 versus December 31, 2015.  
     
  Deferred income taxes and other liabilities increased $111,930 (291%) to $150,423 from $38,493 due to an increase of $60,000 in ad valorem tax accruals and an increase of $51,930 in current deferred income taxes. Ad valorem (property) taxes are primarily for Texas properties and are accrued for the first three quarters each year to be paid in the fourth quarter.  
     
   Discussion of Significant Changes in the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows.  As noted in the first paragraph above, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,108,657 in 2016, a decrease of $2,819,964 (72%) from the comparable period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to decreased operating revenues, partly offset by decreased production, exploration and current income tax expense for 2016 compared to 2015. For more information see  Operating Revenues  and  Operating Costs and Expenses  below.  
     
  Cash applied to the purchase of property, plant and equipment in 2016 was $1,267,879, a decrease of $264,174 (17%) from cash applied in 2015 of $1,532,053. In both 2016 and 2015, cash applied to property, plant and equipment additions was mostly related to oil and gas exploration and development activity. See the subheading  Exploration Costs  in the  Results of Operations  section below for additional information.  

8

Cash distributions from the Company s equity and other investments were $320,000 in 2016, an increase of $270,000 (540%) from $50,000 in 2015. Part of the increase was due to the 2016 distribution by Broadway Sixty-Eight, Ltd. of the profit from the sale of the last of six small commercial office buildings. The office buildings were constructed by Broadway Sixty-Eight, Ltd. on some vacant land adjacent to the office building in which our corporate office is located. See Note 3 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information about this equity investment. The remaining $155,000 cash distribution was from one of the Company s other investments for the sale of some undeveloped real estate. The $50,000 distribution in 2015 was from this same investment.  
     
  Cash applied to the payment of dividends in 2016 was $918,468, a decrease of $661,371 (42%) from cash applied in 2015 of $1,579,839. The decrease was due to a decrease in the dividend paid to $5.00 per share in 2016 from $10.00 per share in 2015, partly offset by the payment of approximately $88,000 of prior years  dividends suspended pending heirship transfers.  
     
   Conclusion.  The depressed oil and natural gas commodity prices continue to present many problems and hardships in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. However, during the first nine months of 2016, the Company has continued to generate positive operating cash flows at levels adequate to cover our operating and financing cash needs. Current cash reserves were used for some investment opportunities during this same period. Management is unable to quantify the effect that a continuation of the current depressed commodity prices will have on the Company. Operating results could be negatively impacted by the non-cash long-lived asset impairment write-downs required by the depressed commodity prices. However, management believes that with our current cash reserves the Company will not suffer any material adverse effects to its financial condition for the foreseeable future. Management is unaware of any additional material trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that would impact liquidity and capital resources to the extent that the discussion presented in the 2015 Form 10-K would not be representative of the Company s current position.   

Material Changes in Results of Operations   Nine   Months Ended   September     30, 201  6  , Compared with   Nine   Months Ended   September   30, 201  5   
       
  Net income/(loss) decreased $668,602 (65%) to $(360,611) in 2016 from $(1,029,213) in 2015. Net income/(loss) per share, basic and diluted, decreased $4.21 to $(2.28) in 2016 from $(6.49) in 2015.  
     
  A discussion of revenue from oil and gas sales and other significant line items in the statements of operations follows.  
       
   Operating Revenues  .  Revenues from crude oil and natural gas sales decreased $2,253,483 (37%) to $3,902,237 in 2016 from $6,155,720 in 2015. Of the $2,253,483 decrease, crude oil sales decreased $1,464,162; natural gas sales decreased $756,126; and miscellaneous oil and gas product sales decreased $33,195.  
    
  The $1,464,162 (39%) decrease in oil sales to $2,269,705 in 2016 from $3,733,867 in 2015 was the result of decreases in both the average price per barrel (Bbl) and the volume sold. The average price per Bbl decreased $11.04 to $34.82 per Bbl in 2016, resulting in a negative price variance of $719,304. The volume of oil sold decreased 16,242 Bbls to 65,176 Bbls in 2016, resulting in a negative volume variance of $744,858. The net decrease in oil volumes sold was mostly due to production declines from older wells, partially offset by production of 2,420 Bbls from new wells in Oklahoma and Texas.  
      
  The $756,126 (33%) decrease in gas sales to $1,524,410 in 2016 from $2,280,536 in 2015 was the result of decreases in both the average price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) and the volume sold. The average price per MCF decreased $0.58 to $2.02 per MCF in 2016, resulting in a negative price variance of $439,527. The volume of gas sold decreased 121,769 MCF to 755,265 MCF in 2016, resulting in a negative volume variance of $316,599. The net decrease in gas volumes sold was mostly due to production declines from older wells, partially offset by production of 53,000 MCF from several new working and royalty interest wells.    
     
  Sales from the Robertson County, Texas royalty interest properties provided approximately 20% and 22% of the Company s first nine months 2015 and 2016 gas sales volumes, respectively. See discussion on page 11 of the 2015 Form 10-K, under the subheading  Operating Revenues,  for more information about these properties.   
     
  For both oil and gas sales, the price change was mostly the result of a change in the spot market prices, upon which most of the Company s oil and gas sales are based. These spot market prices have had significant fluctuations in the past and these fluctuations are expected to continue.   
     
  Sales of miscellaneous oil and gas products were $108,122 in 2016 as compared to $141,317 in 2015.  
     
  The Company received lease bonuses of $208,992 in the first nine months of 2016 for leases on its owned minerals compared to $753,693 in the first nine months of 2015.  

9

In 2016, 66% of the lease bonuses were for leases on owned minerals in Oklahoma, mostly in Woodward County, and the remainder were for owned minerals in Texas. In 2015, 97% of the lease bonuses were for leases on owned minerals in Oklahoma, mostly in Major County, and the remainder were for owned minerals in Texas.  
     
   Operating Costs and Expenses  .  Operating costs and expenses decreased $3,839,582 (43%) to $5,088,388 in 2016 from $8,927,970 in 2015. Material line item changes are discussed and analyzed in the following paragraphs.  
     
   Production Costs.  Production costs decreased $436,205 (22%) to $1,566,803 in 2016 from $2,003,008 in 2015. Lease operating expense and transportation and compression expense decreased $339,693 to $1,420,091 in 2016 from $1,759,784 in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to cost control measures implemented by the well operators. Production taxes decreased $96,512 to $146,712 in 2016 from $243,224 in 2015. This decrease was due to lower oil and natural gas sales revenue discussed above in  Operating Revenues.   
     
   Exploration Costs  .  Total exploration expense increased $117,357 (32%) to $481,963 in 2016 from $364,606 in 2015. The increase is due to an increase in both geological and geophysical expense and dry hole costs. Geological and geophysical expenses totaled $162,449 in 2016 as compared to $76,859 in 2015. Dry hole costs increased $31,767 to $319,514 in 2016 from $287,747 in 2015.  
     
  The following is a summary as of October 28, 2016, updating both exploration and development activity from December 31, 2015, for the period ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  The Company participated with 10.3% and 10.7% working interests in the completion of two development wells on a Woods County, Oklahoma prospect. The wells were drilled in 2015.

   Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Valuation Provision (DD A).  DD A decreased $3,481,258 (65%) to $1,853,485 in 2016 from $5,334,743 in 2015. Part of the decrease was due to long-lived impairment losses for 2015 of $2,394,172 compared to $508,964 for 2016. The remaining $1,596,050 decrease is due to lower oil and gas sales volumes (see  Operating Revenues  above) and a lower depreciable asset base. The lower depreciable asset base is a result of the $3,726,267 of long-lived asset impairment losses for fiscal 2015 and an additional $508,964 of impairment losses for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The impairment losses for 2016 and 2015 are due to lower oil and natural gas futures prices. See Note 10   LONG-LIVED ASSETS IMPAIRMENT LOSS on page 29 of the 2015 Form 10-K for a description of the impairment loss calculation.    
     
   Other Income  /(Loss)  , Net.  This line item increased $271,981 (392%) to $341,356 in 2016 from $69,375 in 2015. See Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements for an analysis of the components of this item.  
     
  Trading securities gains in 2016 were $57,264 as compared to losses of $(34,690) in 2015, resulting in an increase in  Other Income  of $91,954. In 2016, the Company had unrealized gains of $47,764 from adjusting securities, held at September 30, to estimated fair market value and net realized trading gains of $9,507. In 2015, the Company had unrealized losses of $(26,649) and net realized trading losses of $(8,041).  
     
  Other income increased $155,570 (255%) to $216,536 in 2016 from $60,966 in 2015. The increase was mostly due to $155,000 in other investment income in 2016 compared to $50,000 in 2015 and $55,000 of loan guarantee fees received in 2016 from Grand Woods Development, LLC discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying financial statements with no similar fees in 2015.  
     
   Income Tax Provision/(Benefit).  Income taxes increased $644,071 to a $(274,390) tax benefit in 2016 from a $(918,461) tax benefit in 2015. The income tax increase was the result of a $1,312,673 decrease in the pre-tax loss to $(635,001) in 2016 from $(1,947,674) in 2015. Of the 2016 income tax benefit, the estimated current tax benefit was $(70,606) and the estimated deferred tax benefit was $(203,784). Of the 2015 income tax benefit, the estimated current tax expense was $568,747 and the estimated deferred tax benefit was $(1,487,208). See Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information on income taxes.  
     
   Material Changes in Results of Operations Three Months Ended September   30, 201  6  , Compared with Three Months Ended September   30, 201  5   
     
  Net income/(loss) increased $1,191,023 (110%) to $113,018 in 2016 from $(1,078,005) in 2015. The significant changes in the statements of operations are discussed below.  
     
   Operating Revenues.  Revenues from oil and gas sales decreased $409,420 (21%) to $1,512,304 in 2016 from $1,921,724 in 2015. The decrease was the result of a decrease in gas sales of $63,796 (9%) to $643,058; a decrease in oil sales of $351,770 (30%) to $825,505; and an increase in miscellaneous oil and gas product sales of $6,146 to $43,740.  
     
  The decrease in gas sales was the result of a decline in the average price of $0.05 per MCF to $2.47, for a negative price variance of $11,184, and a decrease in the volume of gas sold of 20,878 MCF to 260,075 MCF, for a negative volume variance of $52,613. See the  Results of Operations  section above for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 for additional discussion of gas sales variances.  
     
  The decrease in oil sales was the result of a decline in the average price received of $2.93 per Bbl to $40.19, for a negative price variance of $60,149, and a decrease in the volume of oil sold of 6,763 Bbls to 20,540 Bbls, for a negative volume variance of $291,621. See the  Results of Operations  section above for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 for additional discussion of the oil sales variances.  
     
  Other operating revenues increased $53,855 (50%) to $160,909 for 2016, due to an increase in lease bonuses.  
     
   Operating Costs and Expenses  .  Operating costs and expenses decreased $2,099,627 (57%) to $1,611,679 in 2016 from $3,711,306 in 2015. The decrease was the net result of a decrease in production costs of $130,638; an increase in exploration costs charged to expense of $303,685; a decrease in depreciation, depletion, amortization and valuation provisions (DD A) of $2,244,087; and a decrease in general administrative and other expense (G A) of $28,587. The significant changes in these line items are discussed below.  

11

Production Costs.  Production costs decreased $130,639 (20%) to $517,953 in 2016 from $648,592 in 2015. Most of the decrease is due to lower lease operating expenses for 2016 versus 2015, due to the decline in revenues from oil and gas sales discussed above in  Operating Revenues.  For more information about these changes, see the production costs discussion in the  Results of Operations  section above for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   Exploration Costs.  Exploration costs increased $303,685 to $314,541 in 2016 from $10,856 in 2015. Most of the increase is due to a $288,824 increase in dry hole costs for 2016 compared to 2015.     
    
   Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Valuation Provision (DD A).  DD A decreased $2,244,086 (84%) to $429,168 in 2016 from $2,673,254 in 2015. Most of the decrease was due to long-lived impairment losses for the third quarter of 2015 of $1,837,438 with none in third quarter of 2016. The remaining $406,648 decrease is due to lower oil and gas sales volumes (see  Operating Revenues  above) and a lower depreciable asset base. The lower depreciable asset base is a result of the long-lived asset impairment losses for fiscal 2015 and the three months ended March 31, 2016. The impairment losses for 2016 and 2015 are due to lower oil and natural gas futures prices. See Note 10   LONG-LIVED ASSETS IMPAIRMENT LOSS on page 29 of the 2015 Form 10-K for a description of the impairment loss calculation.    
     
   Other Income  /(Loss)  , Net.  See Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements for an analysis of the components of other income/(loss), net. In 2016, this line item increased $95,771 (418%) to income of $72,879 from loss of $(22,892) in 2015.   
     
  Trading securities gains increased $103,804 in 2016 to $55,544 compared to losses of $(48,260) in 2015. The gains and losses were primarily unrealized.  
     
   Income Tax Provision/(Benefit).  Income taxes increased $648,810 (103%) to a $21,395 tax provision in 2016 from a $(627,415) tax benefit in 2015. The increase was due to the increase in income before income taxes of $1,839,833 to $134,413 in 2016 from a loss of $(1,705,420) in 2015. Of the 2016 income tax provision, the estimated current tax benefit was $(81,261) and the estimated deferred tax provision was $102,656. Of the 2015 income tax benefit, the estimated current tax provision was $156,096 and the estimated deferred tax benefit was $(783,511). See discussions above in  Results of Operations  section and Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements for additional explanation of the changes in the provision for income taxes.  
     
  There were no additional material changes between the quarters, which were not covered in the discussion in the  Results of Operations  section above for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
