STATEMENTS.

The
accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated
financial statements.

AFTERMASTER, INC. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 

NOTE 1   CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the
Company without audit.  In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2016, and for all
periods presented herein, have been made. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America have
been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these
condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's
June 30, 2015 audited financial statements.  The results
of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are
not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full
years. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN 

The
Company's financial statements are prepared using generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of
assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $65,993,671,
negative working capital of $6,283,185, and currently has revenues
which are insufficient to cover its operating costs, which raises
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues
sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as
a going concern.  

The future of the Company as an operating business will depend on
its ability to (1) obtain sufficient capital contributions and/or
financing as may be required to sustain its operations and (2) to
achieve adequate revenues from its ProMaster and AfterMaster
businesses. Management's plan to address these issues includes, (a)
continued exercise of tight cost controls to conserve cash, (b)
obtaining additional financing, (c) more widely commercializing the
AfterMaster and ProMaster products, and (d) identifying and
executing on additional revenue generating
opportunities. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans
described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other
sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a
going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital,
it could be forced to cease operations. 

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
periods. Significant estimates are made in relation to the
allowance for doubtful accounts and the fair value of certain
financial instruments.   

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
AfterMaster, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant
inter-Company accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. 

Investments 

Our available for securities are considered Level 1. Realized gains
and losses on these securities are included in  Other income
(expense)   net  in the consolidated statements of
income using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains
and losses, on available-for-sale securities are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (accumulated OCI).
Unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are
recorded in other income (expense)   net, with the
corresponding reduction to the carrying basis of the
investment. 

Our short-term investments are recorded at amortized cost, and the
respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Our available
for securities maturing within one year are recorded in
 Other current assets,  on the balance
sheets. 

Notes and Other Receivables 

Notes and other receivables are stated at amounts management
expects to collect. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided
for uncollectible receivables based upon management's evaluation of
outstanding accounts receivable at each reporting period
considering historical experience and customer credit quality and
delinquency status. Delinquency status is determined by contractual
terms. Bad debts are written off against the allowance when
identified.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

continued    

Fair Value Instruments 

Cash is the Company s only financial asset or liability
required to be recognized at fair value and is measured using
quoted prices for active markets for identical assets (Level 1 fair
value hierarchy).  The carrying amounts reported in the
balance sheets for notes receivable and accounts payable and
accrued expenses approximate their fair market value based on the
short-term maturity of these instruments. 

The fair value of the Company s notes payable at September
30, 2016 is approximately $6,651,899.  Market prices are
not available for the Company s loans due to related parties
or its other notes payable, nor are market prices of similar loans
available.  The Company determined that the fair value of
the notes payable based on its amortized cost basis due to the
short term nature and current borrowing terms available to the
Company for these instruments. 

Reclassification 

Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on reported losses. 

Derivative Liabilities 

The Company has financial instruments that are considered
derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative
accounting. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the
host instrument and are recognized as derivative liabilities in the
Company s balance sheet. The Company measures these
instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes changes in
their estimated fair value in results of operations during the
period of change. The Company has a sequencing policy
regarding share settlement wherein instruments with the earliest
issuance date would be settled first. The sequencing policy also
considers contingently issuable additional shares, such as those
issuable upon a stock split, to have an issuance date to coincide
with the event giving rise to the additional shares. 

Using this sequencing policy, the Company used this sequencing
policy, all instruments convertible into common stock, including
warrants and the conversion feature of notes payable, issued
subsequent to July 5, 2016 until the note was converted on the same
day were derivative liabilities. The Company again used this
sequencing policy, all instruments convertible into common stock,
including warrants and the conversion feature of notes payable,
issued subsequent to August 19, 2016 until the note was converted
on August 22, 2016 were derivative liabilities. 

The Company values these convertible notes payable using the
multinomial lattice method that values the derivative liability
within the notes based on a probability weighted discounted cash
flow model. The resulting liability is valued at each reporting
date and the change in the liability is reflected as change in
derivative liability in the statement of operations. 

Income Taxes 

There is no income tax provision for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 due to net operating losses for which
there is no benefit currently available. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had deferred tax assets
associated with state and federal net operating losses. The Company
has recorded a corresponding full valuation allowance as it is more
likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC
605,   Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements  , which
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure
of revenue in financial statements. ASC 605 outlines the basic
criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides
guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. In
general, the Company recognizes revenue related to goods and
services provided when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
(iii) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is
reasonably assured.  

The Company's revenues are generated from AfterMaster products and
services, and licensing fees.  Revenues related to
licensing fees generated per a term sheet with bBooth are recorded
when payment is received as there is no current executed agreement
in place and the term of use is indefinite, pursuant to which
bBooth agreed to acquire exclusive rights to license certain
technologies, intellectual property, and patents from AfterMaster.
The key terms of the letter agreement consist of the
following: 

bBooth
agreed to pay the Company $1,250,000 over 18 months, for a
conditional perpetual license of intellectual property (including
related patents and other assets), of which, to date, $200,000 has
been received; 

bBooth
agreed to grant 600,000 shares of our common stock to Studio One,
which shares were received on November 10, 2014 valued at
$1,800,000 and; 

upon
full receipt of the $1,250,000 cash consideration, Bbooth will have
the option to purchase six complete MyStudio booths, one fully
operational mobile studio and truck, and an interest in its
MyStudio TV show, for nominal additional
consideration.

Loss Per Share 

Basic earnings (loss) per Common Share is computed by dividing
losses attributable to Common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. The
losses attributable to Common shareholders was increased for
accrued and deemed dividends on Preferred Stock during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $42,238 and $16,789,
respectively. 

Diluted earnings per Common Share is computed by dividing income
(loss) attributable to Common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of Shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional Shares of Common
Stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive
securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include
outstanding convertible Preferred Stock, stock options, warrants,
and convertible debt. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive
securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock
method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company s
Common Stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from
potentially dilutive securities. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, all of the
Company s potentially dilutive securities (warrants, options,
convertible preferred stock, and convertible debt) were excluded
from the computation of diluted earnings per share as they were
anti-dilutive.  The total number of potentially dilutive
Common Shares that were excluded were 27,689,839 and 23,860,236 at
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements
issued since the last audit of our consolidated financial
statements. The Company s management believes that these
recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the
Company s consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 4   SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE 

On November 10, 2014, the Company received 600,000 shares of b
Booth stock as part of an Asset License agreement with b Booth. The
following table presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized
gains, gross unrealized losses, and fair market value of
available-for-sale equity securities, nearly all of which are
attributable to the Company's investment in b Booth stock, as
follows: 

NOTE 5   NOTES PAYABLE 

Convertible Notes Payable 

In accounting for its convertible notes payable, proceeds from the
sale of a convertible debt instrument with Common Stock purchase
warrants are allocated to the two elements based on the relative
fair values of the debt instrument without the warrants and of the
warrants themselves at time of issuance. The portions of the
proceeds allocated to the warrants are accounted for as paid-in
capital with an offset to debt discount. The remainder of
the proceeds are allocated to the debt instrument portion of the
transaction as prescribed by ASC 470-25-20.  The
Company then calculates the effective conversion price of the note
based on the relative fair value allocated to the debt instrument
to determine the fair value of any beneficial conversion feature
( BCF ) associated with the convertible note in
accordance with ASC 470-20-30.  The BCF is recorded to
additional paid-in capital with an offset to debt
discount.  Both the debt discount related to the issuance
of warrants and related to a BCF is amortized over the life of the
note.

NOTE 6   CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 

The Company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value
per share Preferred Stock, of which the following were issued
outstanding: 

The Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A
Preferred") is convertible into Common Stock at the rate of 0.025
share of Common stock for each share of the Series A Preferred.
Dividends of $0.50 per share annually from date of issue, are
payable from retained earnings, but have not been declared or
paid. 

The Company s Series A-1 Senior Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock ( Series A-1 Preferred ) is convertible
at the rate of 2 shares of Common Stock per share of Series A-1
Preferred. The dividend rate of the Series A-1 Senior Convertible
Redeemable Preferred Stock is 6% per share per annum in cash, or
commencing on June 30, 2009 in shares of the Company s Common
Stock (at the option of the Company). 

Due to the fact that the Series A-1 Preferred has certain features
of debt and is redeemable, the Company analyzed the Series A-1
Preferred in accordance with ASC 480 and ASC 815 to determine if
classification within permanent equity was
appropriate.  Based on the fact that the redeemable
nature of the stock and all cash payments are at the option of the
Company, it is assumed that payments will be made in shares of the
Company s Common Stock and therefore, the instruments are
afforded permanent equity treatment. 

The Company's Series B Convertible 8% Preferred Stock ("Series B
Preferred") is convertible at the rate of 0.067 share of Common
Stock for each share of Series B Preferred. Dividends from date of
issue are payable on June 30 from retained earnings at the rate of
8% per annum but have not been declared or paid.

NOTE 9   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Company has financial instruments that are considered
derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative
accounting. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the
host instrument and are recognized as derivative liabilities in the
Company s balance sheet. The Company measures these
instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes changes in
their estimated fair value in results of operations during the
period of change. The Company has estimated the fair value of these
embedded derivatives for convertible debentures and associated
warrants using a multinomial lattice model as of September 30, 2016
and 2015. The fair values of the derivative instruments are
measured each quarter, which resulted in a gain (loss) of $(111)
and $4,374,585, and derivative expense of $0 and $0 during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of
September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the fair market value of the
derivatives aggregated $0 and $0, respectively, using the following
assumptions: estimated 3-0 year term, estimated volatility of
104.34 -71.93%, and a discount rate of 0.88-0.24%.

NOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

In accordance with ASC 855, Company s management reviewed all
material events through the date of this filing and determined that
there were the following material subsequent events to
report: 

On October 1, 2016, the Company issued 300,000 shares of common
stock as payment for services as part of an advisory agreement
valued at $117,000. As part of the agreement the Company also
issued 300,000 warrants as payment for services. The warrants are
have a term of two years, which vest immediately, exercisable at a
price of $0.40 valued at $66,447 

On November 20, 2015, the Company issued a convertible note to an
unrelated company for $600,000 that matures on May 20, 2016. The
note bears 0% interest and had an original issue discount (OID) of
$100,000. This note is not convertible unless there is a default
event, so no BCF was valued. The Company extended the maturity date
for the fourth time by issuing additional $30,000 convertible notes
on October 3, 2016 to November 17, 2016 the company saying
they are not derivatives until it becomes convertible on the
original note, however the $30,000 addition for the extension is to
be considered derivatives.  St. George released a
clarification of amendments to convertible promissory notes that
explained the $30,000 extension fees are the only portion that is
to be considered as convertible and converts within 10 days of
issuance. The intent of the amendment agreements were to
insure the original note dated November 20, 2015 in the amount of
$600,000 remain current and is not convertible until the borrower
defaulted under the amendment agreement dated October 3, 2016. Due
to the immediate conversion into 150,391 shares of common stock on
October 3, 2016 (extension and conversion date) sequencing is
required on other instruments. Because the terms do not dictate a
maximum numbers of convertible shares, the ability to settle these
obligations with shares would be unavailable causing these
obligations to potentially be settled in cash. This condition
creates a derivative liability Under ASC 815-40.The Company has a
sequencing policy regarding share settlement wherein instruments
with the earliest issuance date would be settled first. The
sequencing policy also considers contingently issuable additional
shares, such as those issuable upon a stock split, to have an
issuance date to coincide with the event giving rise to the
additional shares. During the extension and conversion day period
no additional convertible instruments were issued, therefore on the
extension was considered in the derivative
calculation. 

On October 27, 2016, the Company issued   25,000 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock for
$25,000 in cash as part of a private placement.   The Company also issued
50,000 warrants as part of a private placement valued at $10,692.
The warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes pricing
model.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    -
continued   

AfterMaster Audio Technology is
an internally-developed, proprietary (patented and patents pending)
mastering, remastering and audio processing technology which makes
virtually any audio source sound significantly louder, fuller,
deeper and clearer.   Aftermaster
technology has been recognized with several awards including three
at the 2016 CES show in Las Vegas.   AfterMaster is a groundbreaking
technology which eliminates the weaknesses found in other audio
enhancement and processing technologies while offering a much
superior audio experience for consumer and industrial applications.
We believe that our AfterMaster audio technology is one of the most
significant breakthroughs in digital audio processing technology
and has the potential to create significant revenues for the
Company. The broad commercialization of this technology is a top
priority for the Company.   

As the convergence of features on consumer electronics continues,
it is becoming more difficult for leading consumer electronics
companies to differentiate their products. We believe that
AfterMaster provides a unique and significant competitive advantage
for consumer electronics manufacturers by offering their customers
a superior audio experience. AfterMaster technology can be
incorporated into any audio capable device through the addition of
an AfterMaster DSP chip or AfterMaster software. Such uses are
intended to include phones (mobile, home, business and VoIP);
headphones; televisions; stereo speakers; stereos (home, portable,
commercial and automobile); and computers (desktop, laptop and
tablets).     

AfterMaster audio is also the only commercial
audio enhancement technology available that is used for
professional music mastering because it enhances the entire
frequency range without distortion or changing the underlying
intent of the music. Further information on AfterMaster and
AfterMaster products can be found at   www.AfterMaster.com  .    

Aftermaster Consumer Electronics Products 

The Company designs, manufactures and markets unique consumer
electronics hardware products branded as "AfterMaster" products. We
recently began the manufacturing of our first consumer electronics
product developed by the Company, "Aftermaster
Pro".  

AfterMaster Pro is the worlds first personal audio re-mastering
device and defines a new category in consumer electronics products
by offering a product never before offered. AfterMaster Pro is
a proprietary, first-to-market product which has no direct
competition. Smaller than an iPhone, Aftermaster Pro
transforms the audio of a TV, smartphone, headphones, laptop,
tablet, gaming unit, or virtually any audio-enabled device to sound
clearer, fuller, deeper, and more exciting. AfterMaster Pro
connects easily via HDMI or 3.5mm audio cables with virtually any
media source (cable, satellite box, cell phone, computer, tablet,
etc.). When used with a Television, Aftermaster Pro raises and
clarifies dialogue in programming while significantly enhancing the
quality of the overall audio content. This solves the
longstanding issue with TV audio of having to continually adjust
volume during a TV show to hear dialogue. When used portably
with its built-in battery, Aftermaster transforms music and video
to standards that we believe are superior to any portable audio
enhancement device.  

Through Crowd-funding platforms, the company pre-sold over 4,000
Aftermaster Pro's to buyers in dozens of countries, totaling over
$750,000. A majority of the sales were at $150 per
unit.   www.aftermasterpro.com  .
The revenues from the Crowd-funding sales are currently recorded as
deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue when the units
are shipped. The Company has issued a purchase order for 100,000
units with its main supplier and is shipping units as parts are
available. The Company has negotiated several venues in which to
market its Aftermaster Pro, including in-store, on-line and via
infomercial.  

Additional Aftermaster branded products are under development,
which we expect to introduce in the coming year.

Aftermaster Enters Into Agreement with TuneCore for
professional music mastering 

In April of 2016, the Company announced a partnership with
TuneCore, one of the world's largest independent digital music
distribution and publishing administration service. Under the
agreement, Aftermaster will serve as the new
professional mastering service for TuneCore artists. TuneCore
has one of the highest artist revenue-generating music catalogs in
the world, earning TuneCore Artists $541 million from
over 15.2 billion downloads and streams since inception. TuneCore
Music Distribution services help artists, labels and managers sell
their music through iTunes, Amazon Music, Spotify and other major
download and streaming sites while retaining 100% of their sales
revenue and rights for a low annual flat
fee.  TuneCore artists will have direct access
to Aftermaster's world-class senior mastering engineers, and
within 72 hours, they will be able to get their tracks mastered and
ready for distribution. The new partnership builds
upon TuneCore's mission to provide independent artists with
key tools to build their careers, by granting access to
unparalleled mastering that meets the industry's highest
standards.  

Adobe Audition 

Aftermaster's Promaster online audio mastering service will soon be
available on Adobe  Audition  CC, a professional audio
workstation for mixing, finishing and editing audio/video. The
integration of ProMaster will allow Adobe Audition CC users to
instantly master their original work directly within Adobe Creative
Cloud . ProMaster infuses the clearest, deepest sound quality
into any recording, which elevates that audio to a studio
remastered sound experience. Adobe's Audition CC with ProMaster HD
will enable its users to substantially cut editing time and enhance
original audio work into fuller, deeper, louder and clearer tracks.
When ready, users will install the ProMaster extension from the
Adobe Add-ons marketplace. 

ON Semiconductor/AfterMaster Audio Chip and Software 

The Company is party to a multi-year joint development and
marketing agreement with ON Semiconductor ("ON") of Phoenix,
Arizona, to commercialize its technology through audio
semiconductor chips. ON is a multi-billion dollar, multi-national
semiconductor designer and manufacturer. 

The agreement calls for ON to implement and support our AfterMaster
technology in a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) semiconductor chip
that is being marketed to their current OEM customers, distributors
and others. We selected ON for its technical capabilities, sales
support and deep customer pool. 

In conjunction with ON, we have completed the development of an
AfterMaster software algorithm that is designed to be used in
semiconductor chips or as a standalone software product. We believe
the sound quality from our algorithm provides a superior audio
experience relative to other products on the market. 

Now branded the BelaSigna 300 AM chip, it is one of the smallest,
high power/low voltage DSP chips available. It is small enough to
fit into a hearing aid but equally effective in any size device
with audio capability. 

Since entering into the agreement, both the Company and ON have
identified a large number of prospective customers that will be key
targets for this new and unprecedented technology. The
algorithm and chips allow consumer product manufacturers an
opportunity to offer a significantly improved and differential
audio experience in their products without having to significantly
change hardware and form factor designs. Through the combined
relationships of the Company and ON, we hope to generate
significant revenues for both parties through the sale of the
ON/AfterMaster chips and software licensing. The Company currently
has several sales and licensing agreements pending which it expects
to finalize by the end of the year.

ProMaster 

ProMaster is an online music mastering, streaming, and storage
service designed for independent artists which utilizes proprietary
audio technologies developed by AfterMaster.  ProMaster will
master a user s uploaded music and allow them to compare up
to 90 seconds of their original to the newly mastered songs so they
can make a decision to purchase.   

Tens of millions of songs are produced, distributed and played on
the Internet each month around the world by independent
artists.  However, many of these artists lack the financial
and technical means to master, or  finish  their
composition, as a professional mastering session can cost up to
$500 per song. Now, with the ProMaster online platform, musicians
can transmit their music directly to the ProMaster HD website,
where it can be mastered with AfterMaster Technology for $9.99
per song.   

ProMaster creates a compelling offering for those seeking to
significantly enhance the quality of their music for personal use,
or with intent to showcase their music in hopes of advancing their
career aspirations. Based on the enormous addressable market for
this product, we believe that ProMaster has the potential to
generate significant revenues for the Company. 

ProMasterHD.com   went
live in a soft beta launch in the fourth quarter of 2015 to test
functionality and generate feedback from users. The Company plans a
high-profile worldwide marketing launch for ProMaster in the last
calendar quarter of 2016.    

Recording and Mastering Studios 

Aftermaster operates 7 recording and mastering studios at
it s Hollywood California facilities. The Company engineers
and masters music for both independent and high profile
professional music and is currently mastering the music for the hit
TV show "Empire". 

The Company recently leased the former recording studio built by
music legends Crosby, Stills and Nash in 1977 which is located next
to its existing studios. The Company has completely renovated the
studio and expects that it will be viewed as one of the best
recording studios in the US when it opens in November.

Intellectual Property and Licensing 

The Company has been awarded six patents and six trademarks with
numerous others pending. The Company has an aggressive intellectual
property strategy to protect the AfterMaster and the related
technologies it has developed. We also enter into confidentiality
and invention assignment agreements with our employees and
consultants and confidentiality agreements with third parties, and
we rigorously control access to proprietary technology. During the
year, the Company engaged Mr. Morgan Chu of Irell and Manella, to
represent its intellectual property interests along with IP
attorney, Arnold Weintraub, of the Weintraub Group. Mr. Weintraub
serves on the Board of Aftermaster.

Employees 

As of September 30, 2016 we employed thirteen full-time and one
part-time employees. We expect to seek additional employees in
the next year to handle anticipated potential growth. 

We believe that our relationship with our employees is
good.  None of our employees are members of any union nor
have they entered into any collective bargaining
agreements. 

Facilities 

We lease offices in Hollywood, California (located at 6671 Sunset
Blvd., Suite 1520, 1518 and 1550, Hollywood, California, 90028) for
corporate, research, engineering and mastering services. The lease
expires on December 31, 2017.  The total lease expense
for the facility is approximately $15,375 per month, and the total
remaining obligations under these leases at September 30, 2016,
were approximately $249,082 

We lease a warehouse space located at 8260 E Gelding Drive, Suite
102, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85260.  The lease expires on
February 28, 2019.  The total lease expense for the
facility is approximately $1,821 per month, and the total remaining
obligations under these leases at September 30, 2016 were
approximately $56,687 

We lease corporate offices located at 7825 E Gelding Drive, Suite
101, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85260.  The lease expires on
April 30, 2021.  The total lease expense for the facility
is approximately $7,148 per month, and the total remaining
obligations under these leases at September 30, 2016 were
approximately $437,457. 

We currently generate revenue from our operations through two
activities: AfterMaster revenues, and licensing
revenues. 

AfterMaster revenues are generated primarily from AfterMaster audio
services provided to producers and artists on a contract basis. We
hope this source of revenue grows in coming years, and the Company
is expecting to generate additional revenues in this category from
on-line mastering downloads and the development of the AfterMaster
software algorithm and chip, although such growth and additional
revenues are not assured and may not occur. AfterMaster revenues
for the quarter ending September 30, 2016, increased to $54,486, as
compared to $19,780 for the comparable quarter ending September 30,
2015, the increases were due primarily to an increase in the
mastering and remastering of music and licensing by our
customers. 

Licensing revenues are generated by licensing certain technologies,
intellectual property, and patents to third parties.  Our
licensing revenues decreased to $0 during the quarter ending
September 30, 2016, as compared to the $1,800,000 for the
comparable quarter ending September 30, 2015, due primarily to a
licensing contract with bBooth no longer being in
place. 

In the aggregate, total Company revenues decreased to $54,486 for
the quarter ending September 30, 2016, as compared to total
revenues of $1,819,780 for the quarter ending September 30, 2015,
due to a decrease in licensing revenues. 

22 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   - continued   

Cost of sales consists primarily of AfterMaster Studio Rent,
Consultants, senior engineers, and Internet connectivity and
excludes depreciation and amortization on the studios. The increase
in cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
over the comparable period for the prior fiscal year, is
attributable, primarily, to the Company hiring a new senior
engineer and increase in studio rent for new state-of-the-art
recording studio. 

General and Administrative expenses consist primarily of
compensation and related costs for our staff, finance, human
resources, investor relations, public relations, information
technology personnel and rent and
facilities.  During   the quarter ended
September 30, 2016  , General and
Administrative expenses decreased by $419,146, as
compared   to the quarter ending
September 30, 2015  . The
decrease is mostly due to the decrease consulting fees, public
relations, and travel expenses.  

During   the quarter ending
September 30, 2016  , Research
and Development costs increased by $40,210, Advertising and
Promotion increased by $13,561, Legal and Professional fees
decreased by $102,468 and consulting services decreased by $7,574,
as compared   to the quarter ending
September 30, 2015  . The
increases in Research and Development, Advertising and Promotion,
and consulting services are primarily due to the design,
development and marketing of its Aftermaster Pro consumer hardware
product. Legal and Professional fees decrease are primarily to the
company only using one attorney on a monthly retainer to handle all
the company s legal needs.  

The other income and expenses during the quarter ended September
30, 2016, totaling $(369,184) of net expenses, which consists of
change in fair value of derivative. During the comparable period in
2015, other income and expenses totaled $4,289,652. 

23 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    -
continued    

Due to the Company s cash position, we use our Common Stock
as currency to pay many employees, vendors and
consultants.  Once we have raised additional capital from
outside sources, as well as generated cash flows from operations,
we expect to reduce the use of Common Stock as a significant means
of compensation. Under FASB ASC 718,    Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation    , these
non-cash issuances are expensed at the equity instruments fair
market value.    

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The Company had revenues of $  54,486 
 during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to $  1,819,780 
 in the comparable quarter of 2015. The
Company has incurred losses since inception of $65,993,671. At
September 30, 2016, the Company has negative working capital of
$6,283,185, which was a decrease in working capital of $1,189,031
from June 30, 2016.    

The Company had cash of $971,712 as of September
30, 2016, as compared to $  394,325 
 as of June 30, 2016. The increase is a
result of the company entering into seven (7) Share Purchase
Agreements with individual accredited investors resulting in net
proceeds of $346,000 and five (5) convertible notes payable
resulting in net proceeds of $1,160,000. This amount was partially
offset by operational costs, purchases of assets, and payments of
obligations from convertible notes, notes, and lease
payables.    

The Company had prepaid expense of $453,935 as of September 30,
2016, as compared to $1,078,819 as of June 30, 2016.  The
decrease is due to the Company amortizing the prepaid expenses
totaling $871,971 over the three months ended September 30, 2016,
partially offset by the issuance of two consulting agreements
entered into in the current year and retainer paid. 

The future of the Company as an operating business will depend on
its ability to obtain sufficient capital contributions and/or
financing as may be required to sustain its
operations.  Management s plan to address these
issues includes a continued exercise of tight cost controls to
conserve cash and obtaining additional debt and/or equity
financing. 

As we continue our activities, we will continue to experience net
negative cash flows from operations, pending receipt of significant
revenues that generate a positive sales
margin.   

The Company expects that additional operating losses will occur
until net margins gained from sales revenue is sufficient to offset
the costs incurred for marketing, sales and product development.
Until the Company has achieved a sales level sufficient to break
even, it will not be self-sustaining or be competitive in the areas
in which it intends to operate.  

In addition, the Company will require substantial additional funds
to continue production and installation of the additional studios
and to fully implement its marketing
plans.   

As of September 30, 2016, the existing capital and anticipated
funds from operations were not sufficient to sustain Company
operations or the business plan over the next twelve
months.  We anticipate substantial increases in our cash
requirements which will require additional capital to be generated
from the sale of Common Stock, the sale of Preferred Stock,
equipment financing, debt financing and bank borrowings, to the
extent available, or other forms of financing to the extent
necessary to augment our working capital.  In the event
we cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic
business plan, we may have to significantly curtail our
operations.  This would materially impact our ability to
continue operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be
able to obtain additional funding when needed, or that such
funding, if available, can be obtained on terms acceptable to the
Company.   

Recent global events, as well as domestic economic factors, have
recently limited the access of many companies to both debt and
equity financings. As such, no assurance can be made that financing
will be available or available on terms acceptable to the Company,
and, if available, it may take either the form of debt or equity.
In either case, any financing will have a negative impact on our
financial condition and will likely result in an immediate and
substantial dilution to our existing
stockholders.   

24 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    -
continued    

Although the Company intends to engage in a subsequent equity
offering of its securities to raise additional working capital for
operations, the Company has no firm commitments for any additional
funding, either debt or equity, at the present time. 
Insufficient financial resources may require the Company to delay
or eliminate all or some of its development, marketing and sales
plans, which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s business, financial condition and results of
operations.  There is no certainty that the expenditures to be
made by the Company will result in a profitable business proposed
by the Company.   

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK 

Not required. 

ITEM 4T.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer
(the  Certifying Officers ) are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for
the Company.  The Certifying Officers have designed such
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information is made known to them, particularly during the period
in which this Report was prepared. 

The Certifying Officers responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for
the Company used the  Internal Control over Financial
Reporting Integrated Framework  issued by Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations ( COSO ) to conduct an
extensive review of the Company s  disclosure controls
and procedures  (as defined in the Exchange Act, Rules
13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of the end of each of the periods
covered by this Report (the  Evaluation
Date ).  Based upon that evaluation, the Certifying
Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that the
information we were required to disclose in reports that we file or
submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
rules and forms. 

The Certifying Officers based their conclusion on the fact that the
Company has identified material weaknesses in controls over
financial reporting, detailed below.  In order to reduce
the impact of these weaknesses to an acceptable level, hawse have
contracted with consultants with expertise in U.S. GAAP and SEC
financial reporting standards to review and compile all financial
information prior to filing that information with the
SEC.  However, even with the added expertise of these
consultants, we still expect to be deficient in our internal
controls over disclosure and procedures until sufficient capital is
available to hire the appropriate internal accounting staff and
individuals with requisite GAAP and SEC financial reporting
knowledge.  There have been no significant changes in
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect internal controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred in the three months ended September 30,
2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
