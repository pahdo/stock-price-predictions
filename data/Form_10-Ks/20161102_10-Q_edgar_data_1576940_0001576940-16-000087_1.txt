1.   Basis of Presentation 

Century Communities,   Inc.   (which we refer to as  we,   CCS  or the  Company ) is engaged in the development, design, construction, marketing and sale of single-family attached and detached homes in metropolitan areas in Colorado, Austin and San Antonio, Texas (which we refer to as  Central Texas ), Houston, Texas, Las Vegas, Nevada,   Salt Lake City, Utah   and Atlanta, Georgia.  Our homebuilding operations are organized into the following   six   operating segments based on the geographic markets in which we operate: Atlanta, Central Texas, Colorado, Houston  ,   Nevada  , and Utah  .  In many of our projects, in addition to building homes, we are responsible for the entitlement and development of the underlying land. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as  GAAP ) for interim financial statements and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the  SEC ).   In   the o  pinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and results of operations. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year. The financial statements and related notes do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 201  5  ,    which are   included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the fiscal year ended December 31, 201  5     that was filed with the SEC on   February 19,   201  6  . 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, as well as all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest, and variable interest entities for which the Company is deemed   to be   the primary beneficiary.  All intercompany accounts and   transactions   have been eliminated. 

Use of Estimates 

The   preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable primarily consist of contract receivables related to certain contracts in our Central Texas and Houston operating segments accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.  

We periodically review the collectability of our accounts receivables, and, if it is determined that a receivable might not be fully collectible, an allowance is recorded for the amount deemed uncollectible.  As of September 3  0  , 2016 and December 31, 2015  ,     no   allowance was recorded related to accounts receivable.  

Cash Held in Escrow 

Cash held in escrow consists of amounts related to the proceeds from home closings held for our benefit in escrow, which are typically held for less than a few days.   

Reclassifications  

Prior period amounts related to the   proceeds from home closings held for our benefit   in escrow     were   previously classified in  Accounts receivable  on our   Condensed   Consolidated Balance Sheets   and have been reclassified as  Cash held in escrow  .           The amount reclassified   as of December 31, 2015 was $11.8 million  . 

Recently   Issued Accounting Standards 

In August   2015,   the Financial Accounting Standards Board (which we refer to as  FASB )   issued ASU   2015-1  4  ,    Revenue from Contracts with Cu  stomers (Topic 606).  ASU 2015-1  4 defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with

Table of Contents  

Customers (Topic 606)    and will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that period.   Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.   We are curr  ently evaluating the impact ASU 2015-14   will have on our consolidated financial statements.   We do not intend to   early   adopt ASU 2015-14.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).   ASU 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for   the Company   beginning   January 1, 2019   and interim periods within   the   annual periods.  We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for   the Company   beginning   January 1, 2017   and interim periods within   the   annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period  .  We do not expect t  he   adoption of   ASU 2016-09   to   have   a material effect   on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows- Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .       ASU 2016-15 consists of eight provisions that provide guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments   in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017  .    We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements.    

2. Reporting Segments 

Our homebuilding operations are organized into the following   six   operating segments based on the geographic markets in which we operate: Atlanta, Central Texas, Colorado, Houston  ,   Nevada  ,   and Utah  .  Our Corporate operations are a non  -  operating segment, as it serves to support our homebuilding operations through functions such as our executive, finance, treasury, human resources, and accounting departments.  In addition, our Corporate operations include certain assets and income produced from residential rental property in Colorado.  Our homebuilding reportable segments are engaged in the development, design,   construction  , marketing and sale of single-family attached and detached homes.

6. Warranty Reserve 

Estimated future direct warranty costs are accrued and charged to cost of home sales revenues in the period when the related home sales revenues are recognized. Amounts accrued, which are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, are based upon historical experience rates. We subsequently assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual on a quarterly basis through an internal model that incorporates historical payment trends and adjust the amounts recorded if necessary. Based on favorable warranty payment trends relative to our estimates at the time of home closing, we reduced our warranty reserve by $0.  3   million and $0.  9   million during the three and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016,   respectively,   which is included as a reduction to cost of homes sales revenues on our consolidated statement of operations.

6.875% senior notes  

In May 2014, we completed a private offering of   $200.0   million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due   2022   (which we refer to as the  Initial Senior Notes ) in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (which we refer to as the  Securities Act ).  The Initial Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to   99.239%   of their principal amount, and we received net proceeds of approximately   $193.3   million.  In February 2015, we completed an offer to exchange   $200.0   million

in aggregate principal amount of our   6.875%   senior notes due   2022  , which are registered under the Securities Act (which we refer to as the  Initial Exchange Notes ), for all of the Initial Senior Notes.  The terms of the Initial Exchange Notes are identical in all material respects to the Initial Senior Notes, except that the Initial Exchange Notes are registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions, registration rights, and additional interest provisions applicable to the Initial Senior Notes do not apply to the Initial Exchange Notes.   

In April 2015, we completed a private offering of an additional   $60   million in aggregate principal amount of our   6.875%   senior notes due   2022   (which we refer to as the  Additional Senior Notes ) in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act.  The Additional Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to   98.26%   of their principal amount, and we received net proceeds of approximately   $58.5   million.  The Additional Senior Notes are additional notes issued under the indenture pursuant to which the initial $200 million in aggregate principal amount of Initial Senior Notes were issued.  In October 2015, we completed an offer to exchange   $60.0   million in aggregate principal amount of our   6.875%   senior notes due   2022  , which are registered under the Securities Act (which we refer to as the  Additional Exchange Notes ), for all of the Additional Senior Notes.  The terms of the Additional Exchange Notes are identical in all material respects to the Additional Senior Notes, except that the Additional Exchange Notes are registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions, registration rights, and additional interest provisions applicable to the Additional Senior Notes do not apply to the Additional Exchange Notes.   

The Initial Exchange Notes and the Additional Exchange Notes bear the same CUSIP number, are fungible with each other, and are treated as a single series of notes under the indenture.  We refer to the Initial Exchange Notes and the Additional Exchange Notes, collectively, as the  Senior Notes.   The Senior Notes carry a coupon of   6.875%   per annum.  The Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations which are guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by certain of our current and future subsidiaries. The Senior Notes contain certain restrictive covenants on issuing future secured debt and other transactions.  The aggregate principal balance of the Senior Notes is due   May 2022  , with interest only payments due semi-annually in May and November of each year.  

Revolving line of credit    

On October 21, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Texas Capital Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer, and the lenders from time to time party thereto (which, as modified as described below, we refer to as the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provided us with a revolving line of credit of up to   $120   million (which, as modified as described below, we refer to as the  Revolving Credit Facility ).    

Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we were entitled to request an increase in the size of the Revolving Credit Facility by an amount not exceeding   $80   million. If the existing lenders elect not to provide the full amount of a requested increase, we may invite one or more other lender(s) to become a party to the Credit Agreement, subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer. The Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of   $20   million. The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility were guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries.  

On July 31, 2015, we entered into a First Modification Agreement with Texas Capital Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, the lenders party thereto, and our subsidiary guarantors party thereto, which modified the Credit Agreement.  The First Modification Agreement, among other things, (i) increased the Revolving Credit Facility from   $120   million to   $200   million, (ii) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from   October 21, 2017   to   October 21, 2018  , (iii) admitted Bank of America, N.A. as a new lender under the Revolving Credit Facility, and (   iv) increased the amount of the increase in the size of the Revolving Credit Facility that we had the option to request, from time to time,    from an amount not exceeding   $80   million to an amount not exceeding   $100   million, subject to the terms and conditions of the First Modification Agreement and the Credit Agreement.    

On December 22, 2015, we entered into a Second Modification Agreement with Texas Capital Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, the lenders party thereto, and our subsidiary guarantors party thereto, which further modified the Credit Agreement.  The Second Modification Agreement, among other things, (i) increased the Revolving Credit Facility from   $200   million to   $300   million, and (ii) admitted Compass Bank, an Alabama Banking Corporation, and U.S. Bank National Association as new lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.  

On August 19, 2016, we entered into a Third Modification Agreement with Texas Capital Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, the lenders party thereto, and our subsidiary guarantors party thereto, which further modified the Credit Agreement.  The Third Modification Agreement, among other things, (i) increased the Revolving Credit Facility from   $300   million to   $380   million, (ii) admitted Citibank, N.A. and Flagstar Bank, FSB as new lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (iii) increased certain lenders  respective commitments to the Revolving Credit Facility, and (iv) extended the term of the Revolving Credit Facility by one year to mature in October 2019. 

Unless terminated earlier, the principal amount under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing thereunder, if any, will be payable in full on October 21, 201  9  , the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate plus  

10      

Table of Contents  

an applicable margin between   2.75%   and   3.25%   per annum, or, in the Administrative Agent s discretion, a base rate plus an applicable margin between   1.75%   and   2.25%   per annum. The  applicable margins  described above are determined by a schedule based on our leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also provides for fronting fees and letter of credit fees payable to the L/C Issuer and commitment fees payable to the Administrative Agent equal to   0.20%   of the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.  

The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants (including limitations on our ability to grant liens, incur additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our common stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions), as well as customary events of default.   The Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain (i) a leverage ratio of not more than 1.50 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, based upon our and our subsidiaries  (on a consolidated basis) ratio of debt to tangible net worth, (ii) an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.50 to 1.0 for any four fiscal quarter period, based upon our and our subsidiaries  (on a consolidated basis) ratio of EBITDA to cash interest expense, (iii) a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than the sum of $250 million, plus 50% of the net proceeds of any issuances of equity interests by us and the guarantors of the Revolving Credit Facility, plus 50% of the amount of our and our subsidiaries  consolidated net income, (iv) liquidity of not less than $25 million, and (v) a risk asset ratio of not more than 1.25 to 1.0, based upon the ratio of the book value of all risk assets owned by us and our subsidiaries to our tangible net worth.  As of   September 30  , 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. 

As of   September 30  , 2016, we had $1  9  0.0 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement. 

Other financing obligations 

As of   September 30  , 2016, the Company ha  d     two   insurance premium note  s   outstanding totaling   $  7.6   million   in the aggregate   which mature in   March   2017   and   December   2017  , respectively  .  Th  ese   note  s   bear interest at a rate of   3.89%   and   3.88%  , respectively  .    During the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016 we repaid   three   outstanding land development notes totaling   $2.  7   million   in the aggregate  .  As of   September 30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had   $  7.6   million and   $3.4   million, respectively, of outstanding land development notes and insurance premium notes. 

8. Interest 

Interest is capitalized to inventories while the related communities are being actively developed and until homes are completed.  As our qualifying assets exceeded our outstanding debt during the three   and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  , we capitalized all interest costs incurred during these periods, except for interest incurred on capital leases of equipment related to our golf course   operations.  

Our interest costs are as follows (in thousands): 

9  . Income Taxes 

At the end of each interim period we are required to estimate our annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year, and to use that rate to provide for income taxes for the current year-to-date reporting period  .    Our 2016 estimated annual effective tax rate is driven by our blended federal and state statutory rate of   37.  5  %  , which is   partially offset by   estimated   benefits   of   3.  5  %     from additional deductions for tax related to domestic production activities and estimated energy credits  ,   resulting in an estimated annual effective tax rate of   34.0  %. 

F  or the three months ended   September 30  ,    2016 and 2015  ,   we recorded income tax expense of $6.  4   million and $  5.4   million, respectively. For the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015, we recorded income tax expense of $1  6.8   million and $  13.2   million, respectively.  Our income tax expense for the three months ended   September 30  , 2016 is based on our estimated annual effective tax rate   of   34.0  %     and   a discrete item related to   energy credits   certified   during the three months ended   September 30  , 2016 related to homes delivered in prior years which   decreased our expense   by   $0.  3   million.

10. Fair Value Disclosures 

Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement  , defines fair value as the price that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at measurement date and requires assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed in the following three categories: 

Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 

Level 2   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are inactive; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets at measurement date. 

Level 3   Valuations derived from techniques where one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable in active markets at measurement date. 

The following table presents carrying values and estimated fair values of financial instruments (in thousands): 

(1) 

The estimated fair value of the secured note received in connection with the disposition of the golf course in our Tuscany community in our Nevada operating segment as of   September 30  , 2016   and December 31, 2015   was based on a cash flow model discounted at market interest rates that considered the underlying risks of the note.     

(3) 

Carrying amount approximates fair value due to short-term nature and interest rate terms.     

(4) 

The estimated fair value of the land development notes at December 31, 2015   was   based on cash flow models discounted at market interest rates that considered underlying risks of the debt.      

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. Non-financial assets and liabilities include items such as inventory and long-lived assets that are measured at fair value when acquired and resulting from impairment, if deemed necessary. 

11. Stock-Based Compensation 

Our authorized capital stock consists of 100.0 million shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 50.0 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of   September 30  ,    2016   and December 31,   2015  , there   were   20.7   million   and   20.6   million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively, exclusive of the restricted common stock issued. During the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016, we repurchased   0.2   million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of   $15.03   per share.   

We issued   13.0   thousand   and   0.2   million shares of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock awards during the three and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016, respectively.  We had reserved a total of   1.8   million shares of our common stock for issuance under our First Amended   Restated 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, of which,   0.6   million   shares remain available for issuance     as of   September 30  ,    2016. 

D  uring the three months ended   September 30  , 2016, we   did   no  t grant   any     stock based compensation  . During the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016, we granted   0.5   million shares of restricted stock units with a weighted average grant date fair value of   $14.28   per share. Such restricted stock units vest over a   three   year period from the grant date.  Previously, we had issued awards of restricted common stock under our First Amended   Restated 2013 Long-Term Inventive Plan.

Table of Contents  

A summary of our outstanding awards of restricted common stock and restricted stock units are as follows (in thousands, except years): 

During the three months ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of   $1.  6     million and   $1.4   million, respectively. During the   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of   $  5.1   million and   $  3.9   million, respectively.  Stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general, and administrative on our consolidated statements of operations. 

12.    Earnings   Per Share 

We use the two-class method of calculating earnings per share (which we refer to as  EPS ) as our non-vested restricted stock awards have non-forfeitable rights to dividends and, accordingly, represent a participating security. The two-class method is an earnings allocation method under which EPS is calculated for each class of common stock and participating security considering both dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period.  We use the treasury stock method to calculate the dilutive effect of our restricted stock units as the restricted stock units do not have participating rights. 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except share and per share information): 

1  3  . Commitments and Contingencies 

Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds 

In the normal course of business, the Company posts letters of credit and performance bonds related to our land development performance obligations with local municipalities. As of   September 30  , 201  6   and   December 31, 201  5  , we had   $  66.0     million and   $  63.6     million, respectively, in letters of credit and performance bonds issued and outstanding. 

Litigation 

The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits that arise primarily in the ordinary course of business, which consist primarily of construction defect claims. It is the opinion of   our   management that if the claims have merit, parties other than the Company would be, at least in part, liable for the claims, and eventual outcome of these claims will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. When we believe that a loss is probable and estimable, we record a charge to selling, general, and administrative on our consolidated statement  s   of operations for our estimated loss.

We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. 

14. Disposition of Golf Courses 

On May 26, 2015, we disposed of the operations of the golf course in our Tuscany community in our Nevada operating segment for total consideration of   $4.0   million, which included   $1.0   million in cash and a   $3.0   million secured note, and resulted in a gain on sale of   $2.0   thousand. The secured note accrues interest at rates ranging from   4.5%   to   5.5%   per annum and requires   monthly   payments of principal and interest with a balloon payment of   $2.5   million of principal in   May of 2020  .   

As the put option we   exercised   on the golf course in our Rhodes Ranch golf community   was not responded to by the counterparty,   during the second quarter of 2016  , we initiated a plan for the   disposition of the golf course  .  W  e believe the disposition is probable within   one   year   and  ,    a  ccordingly, the assets and liabilities   have continued to be   classified as held for sale and presented in prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the   condensed   consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30  , 2016.    

15  . Supplemental Guarantor Information 

In May 2014, we completed a private offering of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our   6.875%   senior notes due 2022 (which we refer to as the  Initial Senior Notes ).    In February 2015, we completed an offer to exchange $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.875% senior notes due 2022, which are registered under the Securities Act (which we refer to as the  Initial Exchange Notes ), for all of the Initial Senior Notes sold and issued in the May 2014 private offering.  The     terms of the Initial Exchange Notes are identical in all material respects to the Initial Senior Notes, except that the Initial Exchange Notes are registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions, registration rights, and additional interest provisions applicable to the Initial Senior Notes do not apply to the Initial Exchange Notes.       

In April 2015, we completed a private offering of an additional $60 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.875% senior notes due 2022 (which we refer to as the  Additional Senior Notes ).  In October 2015, we completed an offer to exchange $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.875% senior notes due 2022, which are registered under the Securities Act (which we refer to as the  Additional Exchange Notes ), for all of the Additional Senior Notes.  The terms of the Additional Exchange Notes are identical in all material respects to the Additional Senior Notes, except that the Additional Exchange Notes are registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions, registration rights, and additional interest provisions applicable to the Additional Senior Notes do not apply to the Additional Exchange Notes.   

The Additional Senior Notes and the Additional Exchange Notes are additional notes issued under the indenture pursuant to which the Initial Senior Notes and Initial Exchange Notes were issued.  The Initial Exchange Notes and the Additional Exchange Notes bear the same CUSIP number, are fungible with each other, and are treated as a single series of notes under the indenture.  We refer to the Initial Exchange Notes and the Additional Exchange Notes, collectively, as the  Senior Notes.   

The Senior Notes are our unsecured senior obligations, and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly-owned operating subsidiaries (which we refer to as  Guarantors ).  

The Indenture governing the Senior Notes provides that the guarantees of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged: (1) upon any sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of all of the equity interests of such Guarantor after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a  Restricted Subsidiary  (as defined in the Indenture), which sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition does not constitute an  Asset Sale  (as defined in the Indenture) or is made in compliance with applicable provisions of the Indenture; (2) upon any sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of all of the assets of such Guarantor, which sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition does not constitute an Asset Sale or is made in compliance with applicable provisions of the Indenture; provided, that after such sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition, such Guarantor is an  Immaterial Subsidiary  (as defined in the Indenture); (3) unless a default has occurred and is continuing, upon the release or discharge of such Guarantor from its guarantee of any indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company and the Guarantors so long as such Guarantor would not then otherwise be required to provide a guarantee pursuant to the Indenture; provided that if such Guarantor has incurred any indebtedness in reliance on its status as a Guarantor in compliance with applicable provisions of the Indenture, such Guarantor s obligations under such indebtedness, as the case may be, so incurred are satisfied in full and discharged or are otherwise permitted to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary (other than a Guarantor) in compliance with applicable provisions of the Indenture; (4) upon the designation of such Guarantor as an  Unrestricted Subsidiary  (as defined in the Indenture), in accordance with the Indenture; (5) if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option under the Indenture or if the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors are discharged in compliance

with applicable provisions of the Indenture, upon such exercise or discharge; or (6) in connection with the dissolution of such Guarantor under applicable law in accordance with the Indenture.  

As the guarantees were made in connection with the February 2015 exchange offer for the Initial Exchange Notes and the October 2015 exchange offer for the Additional Exchange Notes, the Guarantors  condensed financial information is presented as if the guarantees existed during the periods presented. If any Guarantors are released from the guarantees in future periods, the changes are reflected prospectively.  

We have determined that separate, full financial statements of the Guarantors would not be material to investors and, accordingly, supplemental financial information is presented below:

16. Subsequent Events 

On November 1, 2016  ,   we   acquired   a 50%   ownership of   WJH LLC (which we refer to as  WJH ), which is a successor to   Wade Jurney Homes, Inc. and Wade Jurney of Florida, Inc. (which we refer   to together as  Wade Jurney )   for   $15.0   million.  W  JH primarily targets first-  time homebuyers in the Southea  stern United States.        As a result of the transaction, we now own     50%     of   WJH   and   Wade Jurney     owns t  he other   50%   interest.    E  ac  h     party   contributed   an additional     $3.0   million in capital to WJH upon its formation.   The Company and Wade Jurney will share responsibility for all of   WJH   s strategic decisions, with Wade Jurney continuing to manage the day  -  to  -  day operations under the existing operating model.

Some of the statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (which we refer to as this  Form 10-Q ) constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, forecasts, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.  These statements are only predictions.  We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees.  Actual events and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as  may,   will,   should,   expect,   could,   intend,   plan,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,   predict,   potential  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology.

Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. 

The forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q reflect our current views about future events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause our actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement.  Statements regarding the following subjects, among others, may be forward-looking: 

economic changes either nationally or in the markets in which we operate, including declines in employment, volatility of mortgage interest rates and inflation;     

continued or increased downturn in the homebuilding industry;     

changes in assumptions used to make industry forecasts;     

continued volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets and broader financial markets;     

our future operating results and financial condition;

shortages of or increased prices for labor, land or raw materials used in housing construction;     

delays in land development or home construction resulting from adverse weather conditions or other events outside our control;     

changes in, or the failure or inability to comply with, governmental laws and regulations;     

the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals and the opening of projects;     

the degree and nature of our competition;     

our leverage and debt service obligations; and     

availability of qualified personnel and our ability to retain our key personnel.     

The forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of future events, taking into account all information currently available to us.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future events or of our performance.  These beliefs, assumptions and expectations can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us.  Some of these events and factors are described in  Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and in  Part II, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in this Form 10-Q, and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this and our other reports and filings with the SEC.  If a change occurs, our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations may vary materially from those expressed in or implied by our forward-looking statements.  New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence of those matters or the manner in which they may affect us.  Except as required by law, we are not obligated to, and do not intend to, update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Overview 

We are engaged in the development, design, construction, marketing and sale of single-family attached and detached homes in metropolitan areas in Colorado, Austin and San Antonio, Texas (which we refer to as  Central Texas ), Houston, Texas, Las Vegas, Nevada, Atlanta, Georgia, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  Our homebuilding operations are organized into the following six operating segments based on the geographic markets in which we operate: Atlanta, Central Texas, Colorado, Houston, Nevada and Utah.  In many of our projects, in addition to building homes, we are responsible for the entitlement and development of the underlying land. 

We build and sell an extensive range of home types across a variety of price points. Our emphasis is on acquiring well-located land positions and offering quality homes with innovative design elements. 

Results of Operations  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we delivered 70  6   homes,   with an average sales price of $351.4 thousand. During the same period, we generated approximately $248.1 million in   home sales revenues, approximately $19.7 million in income before income tax expense, and approximately $13.3 million in net income.  

During the nine months ended Septem  ber 30, 2016, we delivered 2,013   homes, with an average sales price of $341.0 thousand. During the same period, we generated approximately $686.3 million in hom  e   sales revenues, approximately $51.3 million in income before income tax expense, and approximately $34.5 million in net income.   

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net new home contracts totaled 628 and 2,291, respectively, a 31.7% and a 20.5% increase over the same periods in 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we had a backlog of 992 sold but unclosed homes, a 9.7% increase as compared to September 30, 2015, consisting of approximately $380.9 million in sales value, a 17.2% increase as compared to September 30, 2015.

Home Sales Revenues and Homes Delivered  

The   following tables summarize our home deliveries and average sales price for each of our operating segments for the   three   and nine months ended September 30  , 201  6 and   201  5: 

We generated $248.1 million and $686.3 million in home sales revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  This represents a 38.0% and a 31.8% increase as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, where   we generated $179.8     million and $520.9 million in home sales revenues, respectively  .  The increase in home sales revenues is a result of   increased deliveries as well as   an   increase in   our   average sales price  , period over period.    

Our a  verage sales price   increased    1  3.0  % to $3  51.4   thousand for the   three months   ended   September 30,   201  6, and increased 14.9% to $341.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compar  ed to   the same periods in     201  5.    The  se     increases are primarily   a result of   changes in our product mix and     price appreciation in most of our markets, in particular our Atlanta and Colorado operating segments.  The increase in our Houston average sales price is related to additional deliveries in higher priced communities as compared to prior periods.    

Cost of Home Sales Revenues 

Cost of home sales revenues increased $56.2 million and $133.4 million, or 39.7% and 32.0%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase in cost of home sales revenues correlates with the increase in home sales revenues. 

Homebuilding Gross Margin  

Homebuilding gross margin represents home sales revenues less cost of home sales revenues. Our homebuilding gross margin percentage, which represents homebuilding gross margin divided by home sales revenues, decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 21.3% to 20.3% and decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 20.0% to 19.9%, as compared to same periods in 2015.    The decrease in homebuilding gross margin percentage is primarily a result of higher interest in cost of home sales revenues.

Table of Contents  

In the following table, we calculate our homebuilding gross margin adjusting for interest in cost of sales, and purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory. 

(1)      Non-GAAP financial measure.  

Excluding interest in cost of home sales revenues and purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory, our adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 22.  5  % and 21.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to 2  2.8  % and 21.  9  % for same periods in 2015, respectively. Our adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentages remained consistent period over period.  We believe the above information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that indebtedness and acquisitions have on homebuilding gross margin and allows for comparability of our homebuilding gross margins to previous periods and our competitors.       

Gross Margin on Land Sales  

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we disposed of land for $4.7 million and $7.9 million, respectively, which had carrying basis of $4.3   million and $6.7 million, respectively.  Land sales were driven by communities in our Central Texas and Houston operating segments  .   

Gross Margin on Golf Course and Other 

On May 26, 2015, we disposed of the operations of the golf course in our Tuscany community in our Nevada operating segment for total consideration of $4.0 million, which included $1.0 million in cash and a $3.0 million secured note, and resulted in a gain of $2.0 thousand. The secured note accrues interest at rates ranging from 4.5% to 5.5% per annum and requires monthly payments of principal and interest with a balloon payment of $2.5 million of principal in May of 2020.  

As the put option we   exercised   on the golf course in our Rhodes Ranch golf community   was not responded to by the counterparty,   during the second quarter of 2016  , we initiated a plan for the   disposition of the golf course  .  W  e believe the disposition is probable within one year   and, a  ccordingly, the assets and liabilities   have continued to be   classified as held for sale and presented in prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the   condensed   consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30  , 2016  . 

24      

Table of Contents  

We generated approximately $0.7 million and $0.7 million in golf course   and other   revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were partially offset by costs associated with the golf courses of $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively. We generated approximately $2.9 million and $4.7 million in revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were partially offset by costs associated with the golf courses of $2.8 million and $4.2 million, respectively.  The decrease in golf course revenues and costs are a result of operating one golf course in 2016 as compared to two golf courses in 2015. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expense  

Our selling, general and administrative costs increased $8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the following: (1)   an increase of $2.7 million in commission expense resulting from a 38.0% increase in home sales   revenues, (2) an increase of $1.0 million in our compensation-related expenses, including incentive compensation, resulting largely from a 12.4% increase in our headcount to 545 employees as of September 30, 2016, as compared to 485 employees as of September 30, 2015,   (3)     an increase of $1.4 million in legal expenses, (4) an increase of $0.3 million in advertising expenses, and     (5)   an increase of $  3.3   million related to moderate increases in rent, model expenses  , d  epreciation, IT expenses and other corporate expenses.   

Our selling, general and administrative costs increased $21.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the following: (1) an increase of $6.  6   million in commission expense resulting from a 31.8% increase in home sales revenues,  (2) an increase of $5.1 million in our compensation-related expenses, including incentive compensation, resulting largely from a 12.4% increase in our headcount to 545 employees as of September 30, 2016, as compared to 485 employees as of September   30, 2015  ,  (3) an increase of $2.4 million related to advertising costs associated with an increased number of active communities, (4) an increase of $1.0 million related to depreciation expense as a result of an increased number of open communities and associated model home furnishings,   (5) an increase of $1.9 million in legal expenses, and (6  ) an increase of $  4.6   million related to increases in feasibility related costs, rent, model expenses, IT expenses and other corporate expenses.       

Other Income (Expense)  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, other income (expense) increased to income of $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively, from income of $0.1 million and $0.9 million for   same periods in 2015, respectively.  

Income Tax Expense  

At the end of each interim period  ,   we are required to estimate our annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year, and to use that rate to provide for income taxes for the current year-to-date reporting period.  Our 2016 estimated annual effective tax rate is driven by our blended federal and state statutory rate of   37.  5  %  , which is partially offset by estimated benefits of   3  .5  %   from additional deductions for tax related to domestic production activities and estimated energy credits, resulting in an estimated annual effective tax rate of   3  4.0  %. 

For the three months ended September 30,   2016 and 2015, we recorded income tax expense of $6.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded income tax expense of $16.8 million and $13.2 million, respectively.  Our income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is based on our estimated annual effective tax rate of 3  4.0  % and a discrete item related to energy credits certified during the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to homes delivered in prior years  ,   which decreased our expense by $0.3 million.

Of our total lots owned and controlled as of September 30, 2016, 52.5% were owned and 47.5% were controlled, as compared to 68.4% owned and 31.6% controlled as of December 31, 2015. 

Total assets increased by $83.6 million, or 9.1%, to $1.0 billion at September 30, 2016. The increase is primarily driven by an increased investment in our Atlanta and Nevada   operating segments   as well as our entrance into Utah.

Net new home   contracts (new home contracts net of cancellations) for the   three months   ended September 30, 2016 increased by 151 homes, or 31.7%, to 628, compared   to   477   for the same period in 2015.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net new home contracts increased by 390 homes, or 20.5%, to 2,291, compared to 1,901   for the same period in 2015.  The increase in net new home orders is a result of increased demand in the majority of our markets  .    

Our overall  absorption rate  (the rate at which home orders are contracted, net of cancellations) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was an average of 7.0 and 25.5 per selling community (2.3 and 2.8 monthly), respectively, compared to an average of 5.9 and 24.2 per selling community (2.0 and 2.7 monthly) for the same periods in 2015, respectively  . Our cancellation rate of buyers who contracted to buy a home but did not close escrow (as a percentage of overall orders) was approximately 21.6% and 1  8.7  % for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   respectively, compared to 23.0% and 21.0% for the same periods in 2015, respectively.

The change in our cancellation rate was not due to any   one significant factor but was the result of general market activity during this period.

Backlog reflects the number of homes, net of actual cancellations experienced during the period, for which we have entered into a sales contract with a customer but for which we have not yet delivered the home.  At   September 30  , 2016, we had   992   homes in backlog with a total value of $  380.9   million, which represents an increase of   9.7  % and 1  7.2  %, respectively, as   compared to   September 30  , 2015.    The increase in backlog and backlog value is primarily attributable to the increase in the demand for new homes in the communities in which we operate.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and the estimates included in our financial statements might be impacted if we used different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2016, in the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Significant Accounting Policies.   We have had no significant changes in our critical accounting policies from those described therein. 

Prior period amounts related to the   proceeds from home closings held for our benefit   in escrow  , which are typically held for less than   a few   days, were   previously classified in  Accounts receivable  on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and have been reclassified as  Cash held in escrow.   The amount reclassified as of December 31, 2015 was $11.8 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Overview  

Our principal uses of capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were land purchases, land development, home construction, and the payment of routine liabilities. We used funds generated by operations and available borrowings under our Credit Agreement to meet our short-term working capital requirements.  

Cash flows for each of our communities depend on the stage in the development cycle, and can differ substantially from reported earnings. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions, entitlements and other approvals, and construction of model homes, roads, utilities, general landscaping and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of our inventory and not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outlays prior to our recognition of earnings. In the later stages of community development, cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes, as the cash outflow associated with home and land construction was previously incurred. From a liquidity standpoint, we are currently actively acquiring and developing lots in our markets to maintain and grow our lot supply and active selling communities. As we continue to expand our business, we expect that cash outlays for land purchases and land development to grow our lot inventory could exceed our cash generated by operations.   

Covenant Compliance  

On October 21, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Texas Capital Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer, and the lenders from time to time party thereto (which, as modified as described below, we refer to as the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a revolving line of credit (which, as modified as described below, we refer to as the  Revolving Credit Facility ) of up to $120 million. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are entitled to request an increase in the size of the Revolving Credit Facility by an amount not exceeding $80 million. If the existing lenders elect not to provide the full amount of a requested increase, we may invite one or more other lender(s) to become a party to the Credit Agreement, subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer. The Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of $20 million. The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries.  

On July 31, 2015, we entered into a First Modification Agreement with Texas Capital Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, the lenders party thereto, and our subsidiary guarantors party thereto, which modified the Credit Agreement.  The First Modification Agreement, among other things, (i) increased the Revolving Credit Facility from $120 million to $200 million, (ii) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from October 21, 2017 to October 21, 2018, (iii) admitted Bank of America, N.A. as a new lender under the Revolving Credit Facility, and (iv) increased the amount of the increase in the size of the Revolving Credit Facility that we had the option to request, from time to time, from an amount not exceeding $80 million to an amount not exceeding $100 million, subject to the terms and conditions of the First Modification Agreement and the Credit Agreement.    

On December 22, 2015, we entered into a Second Modification Agreement with Texas Capital Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, the lenders party thereto, and our subsidiary guarantors party thereto, which further modified the Credit Agreement.  The Second Modification Agreement, among other things, (i) increased the Revolving Credit Facility from $200 million to $300 million, and (ii) admitted Compass Bank, an Alabama Banking Corporation, and U.S. Bank National Association as new lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.  

On August 19, 2016, we entered into a Third Modification Agreement with Texas Capital Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, the lenders party thereto, and our subsidiary guarantors party thereto, which further modified the Credit Agreement.  The Third Modification Agreement, among other things, (i) increased the Revolving Credit Facility from $300 million to $380 million, (ii) admitted Citibank, N.A. and Flagstar Bank, FSB as new lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (iii) increased certain lenders  respective commitments to the Revolving Credit Facility, and (iv) extended the term of the Revolving Credit Facility by one year to mature in October 2019. 

The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants (including limitations on the Company s ability to grant liens, incur additional debt, pay dividends, redeem its common stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions), as well as customary events of default. The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain (i) a leverage ratio of not more than 1.50 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, based upon the ratio of debt to tangible net worth of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (ii) an interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.50 to 1.0 for any four fiscal quarter period, based upon the ratio of EBITDA to cash interest expense of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (iii) a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than the sum of $250 million, plus 50% of the net proceeds of any issuances of equity interests of the Company and the guarantors of the Revolving Credit Facility, plus 50% of the amount of consolidated net income of the Company and its subsidiaries, (iv) liquidity of not less than $25 million, and (v) a risk asset ratio of not more than 1.25 to 1.0,

based upon the ratio of the book value of all risk assets owned by the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis to the Company s tangible net worth. 

As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.  

Cash Flows Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the comparison of cash flows is as follows:  

Net cash used in operating activities decreased to $6  1.4   million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from net cash used of $146.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash used in operations was primarily a result of a net outflow associated with inventories of $85.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net outflow of $156.5 million during the same period in 2015, primarily driven by the increase in number of homes delivered as well as the higher average sales price of those homes. We had net cash used in working capital items including cash held in escrow, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $  15.3   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to cash used of $20.4 million for the same period in 2015.         

Net cash used in investing activities was $5.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.7 million used during the same period in 2015. The increase relates to increased purchases of property and equipment and deceased proceeds received from the sale   of assets, partially offset by proceeds from a secured note receivable.     

Net cash provided by financing activities was $5  4.5   million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $128.9 million during the same period in 2015. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributed to the issuance of senior notes in 2015 totaling $59.  0 million, an increase   in net payments on our R  evolving   Credit Facility   totaling $25.0 million, and a decrease in cash used for repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase program and upon the vesting of restricted stock awards totaling $2.5 million more used in 2016.  These decreases in cash provided in 2016 were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from insurance premium notes totaling $11.2 million and a decrease in debt issuance costs paid of $  1.7   million.      

As of September 30, 2016, our cash balance was $17.4 million.    

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land purchase contracts in order to procure lots for the construction of our homes. We are subject to customary obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase of land and improved lots. These purchase contracts typically require a cash deposit, and the purchase of   land   under these contracts is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements, including obtaining applicable property and development entitlements. We also utilize option contracts with land sellers   and others   as a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns, to help us manage   the financial and market risk associated with land holdings, and to reduce the use of funds from our corporate financing sources.   These   contracts generally require payment by us of a non-refundable deposit for the right to acquire lots over a specified period of time  , or in bulk at a point in time,   at pre-determined prices. We generally have the right at our discretion to terminate our obligations und  er both purchase contracts and these   contracts by forfeiting our cash deposit   with no further financial responsibility to the   land seller. Our obligations with respect to the option contracts are generally limited to the forfeiture of the related non-refundable cash deposits. As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding contracts for 8,163 lots totaling $351.6 million, and had $  5.8   million of non-refundable cash deposits pertaining to land contracts.    

Our utilization of   land option contracts is dependent on, among other things, the availability of land sellers and others willing to enter into option takedown arrangements, the availability of capital to financial intermediaries to finance the development of optioned lots, general housing market conditions, and local market dynamics. Options may be more difficult to procure from land sellers in strong housing markets and are more prevalent in certain geographic regions.  

We post letters of credit and performance bonds related to our land development performance obligations, with local municipalities. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $66.0 million and $63.6 million, respectively, in letters of credit and performance bonds issued and outstanding.   We anticipate that the obligations secured by these performance bonds and letters of credit generally will be performed in the ordinary course of business. 

Adjusted EBITDA 

The following table presents adjusted EBITDA for the   three   and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure we use as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance. We define adjusted EBITDA  

29      

Table of Contents  

as consolidated net income before (i) income tax expense, (ii) interest in cost of home sales revenues, (iii) other interest expense, (iv) depreciation and amortization expense, and (v) adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations. We believe adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization, and items considered to be non-recurring. Accordingly, our management believes that this measurement is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our adjusted EBITDA is limited as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 

Net Debt to Net Capital 

The following table presents our ratio of net debt to net capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  We calculate this by dividing net debt (notes payable and revolving line of credit less cash held in escrow and cash and cash equivalents) by net capital (net debt plus total stockholders  equity). The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the ratio of debt to total capital. We believe the ratio of net debt to net capital is a relevant and useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of the our ability to obtain external financing.

ITEM 3.     QUANTIT    ATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Interest Rates 

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our Credit Agreement, which was entered into on October 21, 2014. Future borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate plus an applicable margin between 2.75% and 3.25% per annum, or, in the Administrative Agent s discretion, a base rate plus an applicable margin between 1.75% and 2.25% per annum. The  applicable margins  described above are determined by a schedule based on the leverage ratio of the Company, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also provides for fronting fees and letter of credit fees payable to the L/C Issuer and commitment fees payable to the Administrative Agent equal to 0.20% of the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.     Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. 

Inflation 

Our homebuilding operations can be adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher land, financing, labor, material and construction costs. In addition, inflation can lead to higher mortgage rates, which can significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to homebuyers. While we attempt to pass on cost increases to customers through increased prices, when weak housing market conditions exist, we are often unable to offset cost increases with higher selling prices. 

ITEM 4.         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the  Exchange Act )) as of   September 30  , 2016, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30  , 2016 in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or furnish under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

IT  EM 1  .           LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

Because of the nature of the homebuilding business, we and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates have been named as defendants in various claims, complaints and other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of our management, the outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A.         RISK FACTORS. 

There have been no material changes to the risk factors we previously disclosed in our Annual Report o  n Form 10-K     for the fiscal year ended December 31, 201  5     that was filed with the SEC on   February 19, 2016  . 

ITEM 2.         UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

During the   three   months   ended   September 30  , 2016  , certain of our employees surrendered   approximately   5.8   thousand   shares of   our   common stock owned by them to satisfy their statutory minimum federal and state tax obligations associated with the vesting of restricted shares of common stock issued under our First Amended   Restated 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
