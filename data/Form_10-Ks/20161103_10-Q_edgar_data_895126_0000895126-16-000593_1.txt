1.  
    Basis of Presentation  
     Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Chesapeake Energy Corporation ("Chesapeake" or the "Company") and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which Chesapeake has a controlling financial interest. Intercompany accounts and balances have been eliminated. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all disclosures required for financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.    
  This Form 10-Q relates to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (the "Current Quarter" and the  Current Period , respectively) and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 (the "Prior Quarter" and the  Prior Period , respectively). Chesapeake's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ("2015 Form 10-K") includes certain definitions and a summary of significant accounting policies that should be read in conjunction with this Form 10-Q. All material adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods have been reflected. The results for the Current Quarter and the Current Period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
  Risks and Uncertainties 
  Our ability to   grow,   make capital expenditures and service our debt depends primarily upon the prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) we sell. Substantial expenditures are required to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been very volatile, and may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The substantial decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices from 2014 levels has negatively affected the amount of cash we have available for capital expenditures and debt service. A substantial or extended decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and on the quantities of reserves that we may economically produce. Other risks and uncertainties that could affect us in the current commodity price environment include, but are not limited to, counterparty credit risk for our receivables, access to capital markets, regulatory risks and our ability to meet financial ratios and covenants in our financing agreements. 
  Reclassifications 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that requires debt issuance costs related to term debt to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. This standard requires retrospective application and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. This change in accounting principle is preferable since it allows debt issuance costs and debt issuance discounts to be presented similarly in the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to the face amount of our debt balances. A retrospective change to our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, as previously presented, is required pursuant to the guidance. The retrospective adjustment to the December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet is shown below. 

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began presenting third party gathering, processing and transportation costs as a component of operating expenses in our statement of operations. Previously, these costs were reflected as deductions to oil, natural gas and NGL sales. These costs have been reclassified in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the Prior Quarter and the Prior Period to conform to the presentation used for the Current Quarter and the Current Period. The net effect of this reclassification did not impact our previously reported net loss, stockholders  equity or cash flows; however, previously reported oil, natural gas and NGL sales have increased from the amounts previously reported, and total operating expenses have increased by those same amounts.

    Earnings Per Share 
     Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and includes the effect of any participating securities as appropriate. Participating securities consist of unvested restricted stock issued to our employees and non-employee directors that provide dividend rights. 
  Diluted EPS is calculated assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive securities, provided the effect is not antidilutive. For the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period, our contingent convertible senior notes did not have a dilutive effect and therefore were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. See Note 3 for further discussion of our contingent convertible senior notes. 
  For the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period, shares of the following securities and associated adjustments to net income, representing dividends on preferred stock and allocated earnings on participating securities, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as the effect was antidilutive.

 ___________________________________________ 
            (b) 
    The repurchase, conversion, contingent interest and redemption provisions of our contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: 
     Holders  Demand Repurchase Rights  . The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at   100%   of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are   five  ,   ten  ,   fifteen   and   twenty   years before the maturity date.

Optional Conversion by Holders  . At the holder s option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances, the notes are convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarterly. During the specified period in the Current Quarter, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the fourth quarter of 2016 under this provision.  
  The notes are also convertible, at the holder s option, during specified   five  -day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. The notes were not convertible under this provision during the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of the principal amount. 
  Contingent Interest.   We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least   ten years   during certain periods if the average trading price of the notes exceeds the threshold defined in the indenture. 
  The holders  demand repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts (as adjusted to give effect to cash dividends on our common stock) and the ending date of the first six-month period in which contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: 

Optional Redemption by the Company.   We may redeem the contingent convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for   ten years   at a redemption price of   100%   of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash. In addition, we may redeem our   2.75%   Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 at any time. 
           (c) 
    The carrying amount associated with the equity component of our contingent convertible senior notes as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 is net of   $28 million   and   $133 million  , respectively. This amount is amortized based on an effective yield method. 
              (d) 
    See   Interest Rate Derivatives   in Note 8 for further discussion related to these instruments.

Term Loan Facility 
  In the Current Quarter, we entered into a secured   five  -year term loan facility in aggregate principal amount of   $1.5 billion   for net proceeds of approximately   $1.482 billion  . Our obligations under the new facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our revolving credit facility and are secured by first-priority liens on the same collateral securing our revolving credit facility (with a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall junior to the revolving credit facility).   The term loan bears interest at a rate of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 7.50% per annum, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor, or the Alternative Base Rate (ABR) plus 6.50% per annum, subject to a 2.00% ABR floor, at our option. The loan was made at par without original discount. We used the net proceeds to finance tender offers for our unsecured notes.    
  The term loan matures in August 2021 and is subject to a make-whole premium prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the term loan, a premium to par of 4.25% from the second anniversary until but excluding the third anniversary, a premium to par of 2.125% from the third anniversary until but excluding the fourth anniversary and at par beginning on the fourth anniversary. The term loan may be subject to mandatory prepayments and offers to prepay with net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt, certain sales and other dispositions of collateral.    
  The term loan contains covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, sell collateral and use proceeds from such sales, make investments, repay certain subordinate, unsecured or junior lien indebtedness, and enter into transactions with affiliates. 
  Events of default under the term loan include, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect; cross-payment default and cross acceleration with respect to other indebtedness with an outstanding principal balance of $125 million or more; bankruptcy; judgments involving liability of $125 million or more that are not paid; and ERISA events. Many events of default are subject to customary notice and cure periods.    
  Chesapeake Senior Notes and Contingent Convertible Senior Notes 
  In the Current Quarter, we used the net proceeds from our term loan discussed above to purchase and retire   $898 million   principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and   $708 million   principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for an aggregate   $1.5 billion   pursuant to tender offers. We recognized an aggregate gain of   $87 million   associated with these debt retirements, which was net of   $25 million   associated with the equity component of the retired contingent convertible senior notes. In the Current Period, in addition to these tender offers and the repayment upon maturity of   $259 million   principal amount of our   3.25%   Senior Notes due 2016, we repurchased in the open market approximately   $181 million   principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for   $151 million   and   $118 million   principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for   $63 million  . Additionally, we privately negotiated exchanges of approximately   $290 million   principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for   53,923,925   shares of common stock and   $287 million   principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for   55,427,782   shares of common stock. In the Current Period, we recorded an aggregate gain of approximately   $255 million   associated with the tender offers, debt repurchases and exchanges discussed above.  
  Chesapeake Energy Corporation is a holding company and has no independent assets or operations. Our obligations under our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of our   100%   owned subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are minor and, as such, we have not included condensed consolidating financial information.

Revolving Credit Facility 
  We have a   $4.0 billion   senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in December 2019. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings of   $240 million   under the revolving credit facility and had used   $709 million   of the revolving credit facility for various letters of credit (including the   $461 million   supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes litigation discussed in Note 4). The terms of the revolving credit facility include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. We were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  In the Current Period, we entered into the third amendment to our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the amendment, our borrowing base was reaffirmed in the amount of   $4.0 billion   and the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination review was postponed until June 15, 2017, with the consenting lenders agreeing not to exercise their interim redetermination right prior to that date. Our borrowing base may be reduced if we dispose of a certain percentage of the value of the collateral securing the facility. As a result of asset sales discussed in Note 16 and all other sales of collateral since the date of the most recent amendment, as of October 31, 2016, our borrowing base was reduced to   $3.8 billion  . The amendment also provides temporary financial covenant relief, with the revolving credit facility s existing first lien secured leverage ratio and net debt to capitalization ratio suspended until September 30, 2017 and the interest coverage ratio maintenance covenant reduced as noted below. In addition, we agreed to grant liens and security interests on a majority of our assets, as well as maintain a minimum liquidity amount (defined as cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility) of   $500 million   until the suspension of the existing maintenance covenants ends.  
  The amendment reduces the interest coverage ratio from 1.1 to 1.0 to 0.65 to 1.0 through the first quarter of 2017, after which it will increase to 0.70 to 1.0 through the second quarter of 2017, 1.2 to 1.0 through the third quarter of 2017 and 1.25 to 1.0 thereafter. The amendment also includes a collateral value coverage test whereby if the collateral value coverage ratio, tested as of December 31, 2016, falls below 1.1 to 1.0, the $500 million minimum liquidity covenant increases to $750 million, and if the collateral value coverage ratio, tested as of March 31, 2017, falls below 1.25 to 1.0, our borrowing ability will be reduced in order to satisfy such ratio. The amendment also gives us the ability to incur up to $2.5 billion of first lien indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the existing obligations under the credit agreement, subject to a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall in favor of the revolving lenders and the other limitations on junior lien debt set forth in the credit agreement. After taking into account the term loan, the amount of additional first lien indebtedness permitted by the revolving credit facility is $1.0 billion.    
  Fair Value of Debt 
  We estimate the fair value of our senior notes using quoted market prices (Level 1). The fair value of all other debt, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, is estimated using our credit default swap rate (Level 2). Fair value is compared to the carrying value, excluding the impact of interest rate derivatives, in the table below.

    Contingencies and Commitments 
     Contingencies 
  Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings  
  The Company is involved in a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings (including those described below). Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of them seek or may seek damages and penalties, the amount of which is indeterminate. We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. We account for legal defense costs in the period the costs are incurred.

On April 19, 2016, a derivative action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the Company and current and former directors and officers of the Company alleging, among other things, violation of and conspiracy to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, gross mismanagement and violations of Sections 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act related to actions allegedly taken by such persons since 2008. The lawsuit seeks certification as a class action, damages, attorneys  fees and other costs. 
  Regulatory and Related Proceedings.   The Company has received, from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain state governmental agencies and authorities, subpoenas and demands for documents, information and testimony in connection with investigations into possible violations of federal and state antitrust laws relating to our purchase and lease of oil and natural gas rights in various states. The Company also has received DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state subpoenas seeking information on the Company s royalty payment practices. Chesapeake has engaged in discussions with the DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state agency representatives and continues to respond to such subpoenas and demands.  
  In addition, the Company received a DOJ subpoena and a voluntary document request from the SEC seeking information on our accounting methodology for the acquisition and classification of oil and natural gas properties and related matters. Chesapeake has engaged in discussions with the DOJ and SEC about these matters. On October 4, 2016, a securities class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the Company and certain current directors and officers of the Company alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities laws for purported misstatements in the Company s SEC filings and other public disclosures regarding the Company s accounting for the acquisition and classification of oil and natural gas properties. The lawsuit seeks certification as a class action, damages, attorneys  fees and other costs. 
  Redemption of 2019 Notes  . As previously disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K, in connection with the litigation related to the Company s notice issued on March 15, 2013 to redeem all of the 2019 Notes at par (plus accrued interest through the redemption date) pursuant to the special early redemption provision of the supplemental indenture governing the 2019 Notes, the Company filed a notice of appeal on July 27, 2015 of an amended judgment entered on July 17, 2015 by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York awarding the Trustee for the 2019 Notes   $380 million   plus prejudgment interest in the amount of   $59 million  . The Company posted a supersedeas bond in the amount of   $461 million   (reflected as an outstanding letter of credit under the Company s revolving credit facility) to stay execution of the judgment while appellate proceedings are pending. The Company accrued a loss contingency of   $100 million   for this matter in 2014 and an additional   $339 million   in 2015. On September 15, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the trial court s ruling. We intend to seek a rehearing en banc of the appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and may file a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. 
  Business Operations.   Chesapeake is involved in various other lawsuits and disputes incidental to its business operations, including commercial disputes, personal injury claims, royalty claims, property damage claims and contract actions. With regard to contract actions, various mineral or leasehold owners have filed lawsuits against us seeking specific performance to require us to acquire their oil and natural gas interests and pay acreage bonus payments, damages based on breach of contract and/or, in certain cases, punitive damages based on alleged fraud. The Company has successfully defended a number of these failure-to-close cases in various courts, has settled and resolved other such cases and disputes and believes that its remaining loss exposure for these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Regarding royalty claims, Chesapeake and other natural gas producers have been named in various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayment. The suits against us allege, among other things, that we used below-market prices, made improper deductions, used improper measurement techniques and/or entered into arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with the production and sale of natural gas and NGL. Plaintiffs have varying royalty provisions in their respective leases, oil and gas law varies from state to state, and royalty owners and producers differ in their interpretation of the legal effect of lease provisions governing royalty calculations. The Company has resolved a number of these claims through negotiated settlements of past and future royalties and has prevailed in various other lawsuits. We are currently defending lawsuits seeking damages with respect to royalty underpayment in various states, including, but not limited to, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Louisiana and Arkansas. These lawsuits include cases filed by individual royalty owners and putative class actions, some of which seek to certify a statewide class. The Company also has received DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state subpoenas seeking information on the Company s royalty payment practices. 
  Chesapeake is defending numerous lawsuits filed by individual royalty owners alleging royalty underpayment with respect to properties in Texas. On April 8, 2015, Chesapeake obtained a transfer order to move a substantial portion of these lawsuits to the 348th District Court of Tarrant County for pre-trial purposes (MDL). These lawsuits, which primarily relate to the Barnett Shale, generally allege that Chesapeake underpaid royalties by making improper deductions and using incorrect production volumes. Chesapeake entered into a settlement agreement with MDL plaintiffs representing over   97%   of the hydrocarbons at issue by volume and, on July 22, 2016, the plaintiffs who accepted the settlement filed to dismiss such lawsuits. Chesapeake funded the settlement amount of approximately   $29 million   in cash and signed a   $10 million  ,   three  -year promissory note in July 2016, which is accrued for as of   September 30, 2016  . Additional plaintiffs are continuing to accept the settlement on a rolling basis. Chesapeake expects that additional lawsuits filed by plaintiffs not participating in the settlement will continue to be pursued and that new plaintiffs will file other lawsuits making similar allegations. 
  On December 9, 2015, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by the Office of Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in the Bradford County Court of Common Pleas related to royalty underpayment and lease acquisition and accounting practices with respect to properties in Pennsylvania. The lawsuit, which primarily relates to the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, alleges that Chesapeake violated the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL) by making improper deductions and entering into arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties. The lawsuit seeks statutory restitution, civil penalties and costs, as well as temporary injunction from exploration and drilling activities in Pennsylvania until restitution, penalties and costs have been paid and permanent injunction from further violations of the UTPCPL. On February 8, 2016, the Office of Attorney General amended the complaint to, among other things, add an additional UTPCPL claim and antitrust claim alleging that a joint exploration agreement to which Chesapeake is a party established unlawful market allocation for the acquisition of leases. In response to Chesapeake s preliminary objections, the Office of Attorney General filed a second amended complaint on May 3, 2016, alleging further violations of the UTPCPL based upon alleged predicate violations of the federal Sherman Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Chesapeake removed the case to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on May 27, 2016. On August 15, 2016, the federal court remanded the case to state court. 
  Putative statewide class actions in Pennsylvania and Ohio and purported class arbitrations in Pennsylvania have been filed on behalf of royalty owners asserting various claims for damages related to alleged underpayment of royalties as a result of the Company s divestiture of substantially all of its midstream business and most of its gathering assets in 2012 and 2013. These cases include claims for violation of and conspiracy to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and for an unlawful market allocation agreement for mineral rights. One of the cases includes claims of intentional interference with contractual relations and violations of antitrust laws related to purported markets for gas mineral rights, operating rights and gas gathering sources. 
  We believe losses are reasonably possible in certain of the pending royalty cases for which we have not accrued a loss contingency, but we are currently unable to estimate an amount or range of loss or the impact the actions could have on our future results of operations or cash flows. Uncertainties in pending royalty cases generally include the complex nature of the claims and defenses, the potential size of the class in class actions, the scope and types of the properties and agreements involved, and the applicable production years. 
  The Company is also defending lawsuits alleging various violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act and state antitrust laws. In 2016, putative class action lawsuits have been filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and in Oklahoma state courts, and an individual lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court of Kansas, in each case against the Company and other defendants. The lawsuits generally allege that, since 2007 and continuing through April 2013, the defendants conspired to rig bids and depress the market for the purchases of oil and natural gas leasehold interests and properties in the Anadarko Basin containing producing oil and natural gas wells. The lawsuits seek damages, attorney s fees, costs and interest, as well as enjoinment from adopting practices or plans which would restrain competition in a similar manner as alleged in the lawsuits. 
  In April 2016, a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of the Company s   6.875%   Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and   6.125%   Senior Notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the Company s December 2015 debt exchange, whereby the Company privately exchanged newly issued   8.00%   Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 (Second Lien Notes) for certain outstanding senior unsecured notes and contingent convertible notes. The lawsuit alleges that the Company violated the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by benefiting themselves and a minority of noteholders who are qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). According to the lawsuit, as a result of the Company s private debt exchange in which only QIBs (and non-U.S. persons under Regulation S) were eligible to participate, the Company unjustly enriched itself at the expense of class members by reducing indebtedness and reducing the value of the 2020 Notes and the 2022 Notes. The lawsuit seeks damages and attorney s fees, in addition to declaratory relief that the debt exchange and the liens created for the benefit of the Second Lien Notes are null and void and that the debt exchange effectively resulted in a default under the indentures for the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes. In June 2016, the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, and in October 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. A hearing date for the motion has not been set. 
  Based on management s current assessment, we are of the opinion that no pending or threatened lawsuit or dispute relating to the Company s business operations is likely to have a material adverse effect on its future consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The final resolution of such matters could exceed amounts accrued, however, and actual results could differ materially from management s estimates. 
  Environmental Contingencies 
  The nature of the oil and gas business carries with it certain environmental risks for Chesapeake and its subsidiaries. Chesapeake has implemented various policies, programs, procedures, training and auditing to reduce and mitigate such environmental risks. Chesapeake conducts periodic reviews, on a company-wide basis, to assess changes in our environmental risk profile. Environmental reserves are established for environmental liabilities for which economic losses are probable and reasonably estimable. We manage our exposure to environmental liabilities in acquisitions by using an evaluation process that seeks to identify pre-existing contamination or compliance concerns and address the potential liability. Depending on the extent of an identified environmental concern, Chesapeake may, among other things, exclude a property from the transaction, require the seller to remediate the property to our satisfaction in an acquisition or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property.

Commitments 
  Gathering, Processing and Transportation Agreements 
  We have contractual commitments with midstream service companies and pipeline carriers for future gathering, processing and transportation of oil, natural gas and NGL to move certain of our production to market. Working interest owners and royalty interest owners, where appropriate, will be responsible for their proportionate share of these costs. Commitments related to gathering, processing and transportation agreements are not recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets; however, they are reflected in our estimates of proved reserves. 
  The aggregate undiscounted commitments under our gathering, processing and transportation agreements, excluding any proportionate share of these costs from working interest and royalty interest owners, credits for third-party volumes or future costs under cost-of-service agreements, are presented below. 

In addition, we have entered into long-term agreements for certain natural gas gathering and related services within specified acreage dedication areas in exchange for cost-of-service based fees redetermined annually, or tiered fees based on volumes delivered relative to scheduled volumes. Future gathering fees vary with the applicable agreement.  
  Drilling Contracts 
  We have contracts with various drilling contractors to utilize drilling services with terms ranging from   one year   to   three years   at market-based pricing. These commitments are not recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate undiscounted minimum future payments under these drilling service commitments were approximately   $144 million  . 
  Pressure Pumping Contracts    
  We have an agreement for pressure pumping services. Throughout the term of the agreement, which expires in June 2017, the services agreement requires us to utilize, at market-based pricing, the lesser of (i)   three   pressure pumping crews through June 30, 2017 or (ii)   50%   of the total number of all pressure pumping crews working for us in all of our operating regions during the respective year. We are also required to utilize the pressure pumping services for a minimum number of fracture stages as set forth in the agreement. We are entitled to terminate the agreement in certain situations, including if the contractor fails to provide the overall quality of service provided by similar service providers. These commitments are not recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate undiscounted minimum future payments under this agreement were approximately   $79 million  . 
  Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Purchase Commitments 
  We commit to purchase oil, natural gas and NGL from other owners in the properties we operate, including owners associated with our volumetric production payment (VPP) transactions. Production purchases under these arrangements are based on market prices at the time of production, and the purchased oil, natural gas and NGL are resold at market prices. See   Volumetric Production Payments   in Note 9 for further discussion of our VPP transactions.

Net Acreage Maintenance Commitments 
  Under the terms of our Utica Shale joint venture agreements with Total S.A., we are required to extend, renew or replace expiring joint leasehold, at our cost, to ensure that the net acreage is maintained in certain designated areas as of a future measurement date. 
  Other Commitments 
  As part of our normal course of business, we enter into various agreements providing, or otherwise arranging for, financial or performance assurances to third parties on behalf of our wholly owned guarantor subsidiaries. These agreements may include future payment obligations or commitments regarding operational performance that effectively guarantee our subsidiaries  future performance. 
  In connection with acquisitions and divestitures, our purchase and sale agreements generally provide indemnification to the counterparty for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the indemnifying party and/or other specified matters. These indemnifications generally have a discrete term and are intended to protect the parties against risks that are difficult to predict or cannot be quantified at the time of entering into or consummating a particular transaction. For divestitures of oil and natural gas properties, our purchase and sale agreements may require the return of a portion of the proceeds we receive as a result of uncured title defects. 
  Certain of our oil and natural gas properties are burdened by non-operating interests such as royalty and overriding royalty interests, including overriding royalty interests sold through our VPP transactions. As the holder of the working interest from which these interests have been created, we have the responsibility to bear the cost of developing and producing the reserves attributable to these interests. See   Volumetric Production Payments   in Note 9 for further discussion of our VPP transactions. 
  While executing our strategic priorities, we have incurred certain cash charges, including contract termination charges, financing extinguishment costs and charges for unused natural gas transportation and gathering capacity. As we continue to focus on our strategic priorities, we may take certain actions that reduce financial leverage and complexity, and we may incur additional cash and noncash charges.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  For the Current Period and the Prior Period, changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges, net of tax, are detailed below.  

For the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period, net losses on cash flow hedges for commodity contracts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, to oil, natural gas and NGL revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of operations were   $7 million  ,   $5 million  ,   $21 million   and   $18 million  , respectively. 
   
           7.  
    Share-Based Compensation    
     Chesapeake s share-based compensation program consists of restricted stock, stock options and performance share units (PSUs) granted to employees and common stock and restricted stock granted to non-employee directors under our long term incentive plans. The restricted stock and stock options are equity-classified awards and the PSUs are liability-classified awards.  
  Equity-Classified Awards 
  Restricted Stock.   We grant restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. Prior to 2014, we also granted restricted stock awards as equity compensation. We refer to both types of awards as restricted stock. A summary of the changes in unvested restricted stock during the Current Period is presented below. 

The aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock that vested during the Current Period was approximately   $20 million   based on the stock price at the time of vesting. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $68 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   1.59   years. 
  Stock Options.   In the Current Period and the Prior Period, we granted members of senior management stock options that vest ratably over a   three  -year period. In January 2013, we also granted retention awards of stock options to certain officers that vest   one-third   on each of the   third  ,   fourth   and   fifth   anniversaries of the grant date. Each stock option award has an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date. Outstanding options expire   seven   to   ten   years from the date of grant.

We utilize the   Black-Scholes option pricing model   to measure the fair value of stock options. The expected life of an option is determined using the simplified method. Volatility assumptions are estimated based on an average of historical volatility of Chesapeake stock over the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of the grant over the expected life of the option. The dividend yield is based on an annual dividend yield, taking into account the Company's dividend policy, over the expected life of the option. The Company used the following weighted average assumptions to estimate the grant date fair value of the stock options granted in the Current Period. 

The following table provides information related to stock option activity in the Current Period.  

___________________________________________ 
           (a) 
    The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the current market value or the market value upon exercise of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $9 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   1.83 years  . 
  Restricted Stock and Stock Option Compensation.   We recognized the following compensation costs related to restricted stock and stock options for the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period.

Liability-Classified Awards 
  Performance Share Units.   We have granted PSUs to senior management that vest ratably over a   three  -year term and are settled in cash on the   third   anniversary of the awards. The ultimate amount earned is based on achievement of performance metrics established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which include total shareholder return (TSR) and, for certain of the awards, operational performance goals such as finding and development costs and production levels. 
  For PSUs granted in 2016, the TSR component can range from   0%   to   100%   and the operational component can range from   0%   to   100%  , resulting in a maximum payout of   200%  . For PSUs granted in 2015, the TSR component can range from   0%   to   100%  , and each of the two operational components can range from   0%   to   50%   resulting in a maximum total payout of   200%  . For PSUs granted in 2014, the TSR component can range from   0%   to   200%  , with no operational components. Compensation expense associated with PSU grants is recognized over the service period based on the graded-vesting method. The value of the PSU awards at the end of each reporting period is dependent upon the Company s estimates of the underlying performance measures. The Company utilized the   Monte Carlo simulation   for the TSR performance measure and the following assumptions to determine the grant date fair value of the PSUs. The payout percentage for all PSU grants is capped at   100%   if the Company's absolute TSR is less than zero.  

The following table presents a summary of our 2016, 2015 and 2014 PSU awards. 

PSU Compensation.   We recognized the following compensation costs (credits) related to PSUs for the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period.

    Derivative and Hedging Activities 
     Chesapeake uses derivative instruments to secure attractive pricing and margins on its share of expected production, to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in future commodity prices and to protect its expected operating cash flow against significant market movements or volatility. Chesapeake also uses derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. All of our commodity derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. 
  Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Derivatives 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instruments consisted of the following types of instruments: 
             
    Swaps  : Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price to the counterparty for the hedged commodity. In exchange for higher fixed prices on certain of our swap trades, we granted options that allow the counterparty to double the notional amount. 
                
    Options  : Chesapeake sells, and occasionally buys, call options in exchange for a premium. At the time of settlement, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, Chesapeake pays the counterparty the excess on sold call options and Chesapeake receives the excess on bought call options. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from either party.  
                
    Collars  : These instruments contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, Chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price. If the market price is between the put and the call strike prices, no payments are due from either party.  
                
    Basis Protection Swaps  : These instruments are arrangements that guarantee a fixed price differential to NYMEX from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives the fixed price differential and pays the floating market price differential to the counterparty for the hedged commodity. 
     The estimated fair values of our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instrument assets (liabilities) as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 are provided below.  

We have terminated certain commodity derivative contracts that were previously designated as cash flow hedges for which the hedged production is still expected to occur. See further discussion below under   Effect of Derivative Instruments   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)  .

Interest Rate Derivatives 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, there were   no   interest rate derivatives outstanding.  
  We have terminated fair value hedges related to certain of our senior notes. Gains and losses related to these terminated hedges will be amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of the related senior notes. Over the next   four years  , we will recognize   $6 million   in net gains related to these transactions. 
  Foreign Currency Derivatives 
  We are party to cross currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.   In the Current Quarter, in connection with our tender offers, we retired    36 million   in aggregate principal amount of our   6.25%   Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017, and we simultaneously unwound the cross currency swaps for the same principal amount at a cost of   $8 million  .     Under the terms of the remaining cross currency swaps, on each semi-annual interest payment date, the counterparties pay us    8 million   and we pay the counterparties   $13 million  , which yields an annual dollar-equivalent interest rate of   7.491%  . Upon maturity of the notes, the counterparties will pay us    266 million   and we will pay the counterparties   $355 million  . The terms of the cross currency swaps were based on the dollar/euro exchange rate on the issuance date of   $1.3325   to  1.00. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and, because they are entirely effective in having eliminated any potential variability in our expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in their fair value do not impact earnings. The fair values of the cross currency swaps are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as liabilities of   $56 million   and   $52 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. The euro-denominated debt in long-term debt has been adjusted to   $299 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , using an exchange rate of   $1.1235   to  1.00. 
  Supply Contract Derivatives 
    
  From time to time and in the normal course of business, our marketing subsidiary enters into supply contracts under which we commit to deliver a predetermined quantity of natural gas to certain counterparties in an attempt to earn attractive margins. Under certain contracts, we receive a sales price that is based on the price of a product other than natural gas, thereby creating an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. In   one   of these supply contracts, we were committed to supply a minimum   of   90 bbtu   per day   of natural gas through March 2025. In the Current Quarter, we sold the long-term natural gas supply contract to a third party for cash proceeds of   $146 million  , which is included in marketing, gathering and compression revenues as a realized gain. We reversed the cumulative unrealized gains, resulting in an unrealized loss of   $280 million   in the Current Quarter and   $297 million   in the Current Period, respectively.

Effect of Derivative Instruments   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)      
  A reconciliation of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated statements of stockholders  equity related to our cash flow hedges is presented below.    

Approximately   $92 million   of the   $101 million   of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of   September 30, 2016   represents the net deferred loss associated with commodity derivative contracts that were previously designated as cash flow hedges for which the hedged production is still expected to occur. Deferred gain or loss amounts will be recognized in earnings in the month in which the originally forecasted hedged production occurs. As of   September 30, 2016  , we expect to transfer approximately   $22 million   of net loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income to net income (loss) during the next 12 months. The remaining amounts will be transferred by December 31, 2022. 
  Credit Risk Considerations 
  Our derivative instruments expose us to our counterparties  credit risk. To mitigate this risk, we enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are rated investment grade and deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers, and we attempt to limit our exposure to non-performance by any single counterparty. As of   September 30, 2016  , our oil, natural gas and NGL and foreign currency derivative instruments were spread among   13   counterparties. 
  Hedging Arrangements 
  In 2015, we began entering into bilateral hedging agreements. The counterparties  and our obligations under certain of the bilateral hedging agreements must be secured by cash or letters of credit to the extent that any mark-to-market amounts owed to us or by us exceed defined thresholds. In 2016, certain of our counterparties that are also lenders under our revolving credit facility entered into derivative contracts to be secured by the same collateral that secures the revolving credit facility. This will allow us to reduce any letters of credit posted as security with those counterparties.

Fair Value 
  The fair value of our derivatives is based on third-party pricing models which utilize inputs that are either readily available in the public market, such as oil, natural gas and NGL forward curves and discount rates, or can be corroborated from active markets or broker quotes. These values are compared to the values given by our counterparties for reasonableness. Since oil, natural gas, NGL, interest rate and cross currency swaps do not include optionality and therefore generally have no unobservable inputs, they are classified as Level 2. All other derivatives have some level of unobservable input, such as volatility curves, and are therefore classified as Level 3. Derivatives are also subject to the risk that either party to a contract will be unable to meet its obligations. We factor non-performance risk into the valuation of our derivatives using current published credit default swap rates. To date, this has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives.  
  The following table provides information for financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015:

  Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Unobservable Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
  The significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 derivative contracts include unpublished forward prices of natural gas, market volatility and credit risk of counterparties. Changes in these inputs impact the fair value measurement of our derivative contracts. For example, an increase or decrease in the forward prices and volatility of oil and natural gas prices decreases or increases the fair value of oil and natural gas derivatives, and adverse changes to our counterparties  creditworthiness decreases the fair value of our derivatives. The following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 inputs used in the fair value measurement of our commodity derivative contracts at fair value as of   September 30, 2016  :

    Oil and Natural Gas Property Transactions  
     Under full cost accounting rules, we accounted for the sales of oil and natural gas properties discussed below as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no recognition of gain or loss as the sales did not involve a significant change in proved reserves or significantly alter the relationship between costs and proved reserves. 
  In the Current Quarter, we acquired oil and natural gas properties in the Haynesville Shale for approximately   $85 million  . In the Current Quarter and the Current Period, we sold certain of our noncore oil and natural gas properties for net proceeds of approximately   $26 million   and   $988 million  , respectively, after post-closing adjustments. Additional consideration of approximately   $106 million   was withheld subject to certain title, environmental and other standard contingencies. We expect the majority of the amount subject to the hold back will be received. In conjunction with certain of these sales, we purchased oil and natural gas interests previously sold to third parties in connection with   four   of our VPP transactions for approximately   $259 million  . Substantially all of the acquired interests were part of the asset divestitures discussed above and we no longer have any further commitments or obligations related to these VPPs. The asset divestitures cover various operating areas.  
  In the Prior Quarter, CHK Cleveland Tonkawa, L.L.C. (CHK C-T) sold all of its oil and natural gas properties to FourPoint Energy, LLC and immediately used the consideration, plus other cash it had on hand, to repurchase and cancel all of CHK C-T s outstanding preferred shares. In a related transaction, we sold noncore properties adjacent to the CHK C-T properties to FourPoint Energy, LLC for approximately   $90 million  . 
  Volumetric Production Payments 
  From time to time, we have sold certain of our producing assets located in more mature producing regions through the sale of VPPs. A VPP is a limited-term overriding royalty interest in oil and natural gas reserves that (i) entitles the purchaser to receive scheduled production volumes over a period of time from specific lease interests; (ii) is free and clear of all associated future production costs and capital expenditures; (iii) is non-recourse to the seller (i.e., the purchaser s only recourse is to the reserves acquired); (iv) transfers title of the reserves to the purchaser; and (v) allows the seller to retain all production beyond the specified volumes, if any, after the scheduled production volumes have been delivered. For all of our VPP transactions, we novated to each of the respective VPP buyers hedges that covered all VPP volumes sold. If contractually scheduled volumes exceed the actual volumes produced from the VPP wellbores that are attributable to the ORRI conveyed, either the shortfall will be made up from future production from these wellbores (or, at our option, from our retained interest in the wellbores) through an adjustment mechanism, or the initial term of the VPP will be extended until all scheduled volumes, to the extent produced, are delivered from the VPP wellbores to the VPP buyer. We retain drilling rights on the properties below currently producing intervals and outside of producing wellbores.  
  As the operator of the properties from which the VPP volumes have been sold, we bear the cost of producing the reserves attributable to these interests, which we include as a component of production expenses and production taxes in our condensed consolidated statements of operations in the periods these costs are incurred. As with all non-expense-bearing royalty interests, volumes conveyed in a VPP transaction are excluded from our estimated proved reserves; however, the estimated production expenses and taxes associated with VPP volumes expected to be delivered in future periods are included as a reduction of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves for purposes of determining our full cost ceiling test for impairment purposes and in determining our standardized measure. Pursuant to SEC guidelines, the estimates used for purposes of determining the cost center ceiling and the standardized measure are based on current costs. Our commitment to bear the costs on any future production of VPP volumes is not reflected as a liability on our balance sheet. The costs that will apply in the future will depend on the actual production volumes as well as the production costs and taxes in effect during the periods in which the production actually occurs, which could differ materially from our current and historical costs, and production may not occur at the times or in the quantities projected, or at all. 
  For accounting purposes, cash proceeds from the sale of VPPs were reflected as a reduction of oil and natural gas properties with   no   gain or loss recognized, and our proved reserves were reduced accordingly. We have also committed to purchase natural gas and liquids associated with our VPP transactions. Production purchased under these arrangements is based on market prices at the time of production, and the purchased natural gas and liquids are resold at market prices.

    Variable Interest Entities 
     Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust (the Trust) is considered a VIE due to the lack of voting or similar decision-making rights by its equity holders regarding activities that have a significant effect on the economic success of the Trust and because the royalty interest owners, other than Chesapeake, do not have the ability to exercise substantial liquidation rights. Our ownership in the Trust and our previous obligations under the development agreement constitute variable interests. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the Trust because (i) we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Trust via our operation of the majority of the producing wells and the completed development wells, and (ii) as a result of the subordination and incentive thresholds applicable to the subordinated units we hold in the Trust, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that potentially could be significant to the Trust. As a result, we consolidate the Trust in our financial statements, and the common units of the Trust owned by third parties are reflected as a noncontrolling interest. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $259 million   of noncontrolling interests on our condensed consolidated balance sheets attributable to the Trust. Net income attributable to the Trust s noncontrolling interest is presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as   $1 million   in each of the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter and the Current Period, and   a nominal amount   in the Prior Period.  
  The Trust is a consolidated entity whose legal existence is separate from Chesapeake and our other consolidated subsidiaries, and the Trust is not a guarantor of any of Chesapeake s debt. The creditors or beneficial holders of the Trust have no recourse to the general credit of Chesapeake. In consolidation, as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $1 million   of cash and cash equivalents,   $488 million   of proved oil and natural gas properties,   $457 million   of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and   $2 million   of other current liabilities were attributable to the Trust. We have presented parenthetically on the face of the condensed consolidated balance sheets the assets of the Trust that can be used only to settle obligations of the Trust and the liabilities of the Trust for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Chesapeake. 
   
   Impairments of Oil and Natural Gas Properties 
  Our proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to quarterly full cost ceiling tests. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. Estimated future net revenues for the quarterly ceiling limit are calculated using the average of commodity prices on the first day of the month over the trailing 12-month period. In the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling, resulting in impairments in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties of   $433 million  ,   $5.416 billion  ,   $2.331 billion   and   $15.407 billion  , respectively. Cash flow hedges which relate to future periods increased the ceiling test impairment by   $154 million   and   $184 million   in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an impairment to the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties of   $1.045 billion  , which was understated by approximately   $14 million  . The amount of the understatement has been included in our Current Quarter impairment.

Impairments of Fixed Assets and Other  
  We review our long-lived assets, other than oil and natural gas properties, for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. A summary of our impairments of fixed assets by asset class and other charges for the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period is as follows: 

Barnett Shale Exit Costs.   On October 31, 2016, w  e conveyed our interests in the Barnett Shale operating area located in north central Texas and simultaneously terminated most of our future commitments associated with this asset. As a result of this transaction, we accrued   $334 million   of charges in the Current Quarter related to the termination of a natural gas gathering agreement associated with the Barnett Shale assets. Additionally, certain of our other property and equipment, including buildings, surface land, compressors and office equipment, qualified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . We recognized an impairment charge of   $282 million   in the Current Quarter related to these assets representing the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets, less the anticipated costs to sell. 
  Gathering Systems, Natural Gas Compressors, Buildings and Land.   In the Current Quarter, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the majority of our upstream and midstream assets in the Devonian Shale located in West Virginia and Kentucky. Additionally, certain of our other property and equipment, including gathering systems, natural gas compressors and buildings and land, qualified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016. We recognized an impairment charge of   $134 million   in the Current Quarter for these assets for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets, less the anticipated costs to sell.  
  Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.   Fair value measurements for certain of the impairments discussed above were based on recent sales information for comparable assets. As the fair value was estimated using the market approach based on recent prices from orderly sales transactions for comparable assets between market participants, these values were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Other inputs used were not observable in the market; these values were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
   
   A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To assess that likelihood, we use estimates and judgment regarding our future taxable income, and we consider the tax consequences in the jurisdiction where the taxable income is generated, to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. The evidence can include our current financial position, our results of operations, both actual and forecasted, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies as well as the current and forecasted business economics of our industry.

Based on our estimated operating results for the subsequent quarters, we project being in a net deferred tax asset position as of December 31, 2016. We believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated is the projected cumulative loss we expect to incur over the three-year period ending December 31, 2016. This objective negative evidence limits our ability to consider other subjective positive evidence, such as our projections for future growth. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income are increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as future expected growth.

    Segment Information  
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   two   reportable operating segments, each of which is managed separately because of the nature of its operations. The exploration and production operating segment is responsible for finding and producing oil, natural gas and NGL. The marketing, gathering and compression operating segment is responsible for marketing, gathering and compression of oil, natural gas and NGL.  
  Management evaluates the performance of our segments based upon income (loss) before income taxes. Revenues from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL related to Chesapeake s ownership interests by our marketing, gathering and compression operating segment are reflected as revenues within our exploration and production operating segment. These amounts totaled   $1.025 billion  ,   $1.046 billion  ,   $2.656 billion   and   $3.483 billion   for the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter, the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively.  
  During the Current Period, we changed the structure of our internal organization to include certain assets in our Exploration and Production reportable segment instead of our Other segment. Accordingly, this change has been reflected through retroactive revision of the segment information as of December 31, 2015, as shown in the tables below.

    Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
     In May 2014, the FASB issued updated revenue recognition guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and international financial reporting standards. The new standard requires the recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the company expects to receive in the exchange.   The accounting standards update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date as well as permission to early adopt the new revenue recognition standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued an update clarifying the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued an update clarifying the identification of performance obligations and licensing implementations guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued an update clarifying guidance in a few narrow areas and added some practical expedients to the guidance.   We are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance that requires management, for each annual and interim reporting period, to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. If management concludes that conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, certain disclosures are required to be made within the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued updated lease accounting guidance requiring companies to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases of assets on the balance sheet. The accounting standards update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance for improvements to employee share-based payment accounting to simplify the accounting for share-based compensation. The new standard requires all excess tax benefits and reductions from differences between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recorded for financial reporting purposes be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and not recognized as additional paid-in capital. The new standard also requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be classified as operating activity within the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We have elected to early adopt the amendments effective January 1, 2016. The cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for all excess tax benefits not previously recognized as of the beginning period is fully offset by a corresponding change in the valuation allowance resulting in no change. The implementation of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that will result in fewer put or call options embedded in debt instruments qualifying for separate derivative accounting because companies will not be required to assess whether the contingent event, such as change in control or an IPO, is related to interest rates or credit risks. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. We are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

On October 5, 2016, we issued in a private placement   $1.25 billion   principal amount of unsecured   5.5%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. The notes will be convertible, under certain specified circumstances, into cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election. We are using the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include debt repurchases and the repayment of our revolving credit facility and senior notes with near term maturities as they become due. 
  Additionally, on October 5, 2016, we completed private exchanges of an aggregate of approximately   110.3 million   shares of our common stock for (i)   134,000   shares of   5.00%   Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (Series 2005B), (ii)   606,271   shares of   5.75%   Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and (iii)   553,007   shares of   5.75%   Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A). 
  In October 2016, we repurchased in the open market approximately   $105 million   principal amount of our outstanding debt scheduled to mature or that could be put to us in 2017 and 2018 for   $106 million  . 
  On October 18, 2016, we signed a letter of intent to restructure our natural gas gathering and service agreement in our Powder River Basin operating area with Williams Partners L.P. and Crestwood Equity Partners L.P. The restructured services are expected to replace the current cost-of-service arrangement and improve economics which support increased development across an expanded area of dedication in the region. Subject to board approvals from all three companies of the definitive agreement, the restructured services are to become effective January 1, 2017, for a   20  -year term. 
  On October 31, 2016, we conveyed our interests in the Barnett Shale operating area located in north central Texas and received from the buyer aggregate net proceeds of approximately   $218 million  . We simultaneously terminated most of our future commitments associated with this asset. We sold approximately   212,000   net developed and undeveloped acres and approximately   2,800   operated wells, which   produced an average of approximately   59 mboe   per day in the Current Quarter  , along with other property and equipment. In connection with this disposition, we paid   $334 million   to terminate a natural gas gathering agreement associated with the Barnett Shale assets. Additionally, we may be required to pay up to an additional   $70 million   in respect of certain title and environmental contingencies.

    Oil equivalent is based on six mcf of natural gas to one barrel of oil or one barrel of NGL. This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. 
              (b) 
    Beginning in the 2015 fourth quarter, we reclassified our presentation of third party oil, natural gas and NGL gathering, processing and transportation costs to report the costs as a component of operating expenses in the accompanying statements of operations. Previously, these costs were reflected as deductions to oil, natural gas and NGL sales. The net effect of this reclassification did not impact our previously reported net income, stockholders  equity or cash flows; however, previously reported oil, natural gas and NGL sales and consequently total revenues have increased from the previously reported amounts, and total operating expenses have increased by these same amounts.

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

Overview 
  We own interests in approximately 31,800 oil and natural gas wells and produced an average of approximately   638 mboe   per day in the Current Quarter, net to our interest. We have a large and geographically diverse resource base of onshore U.S. unconventional natural gas and liquids assets. We have leading positions in the liquids-rich resource plays of the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Utica Shale in Ohio and Pennsylvania; the Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle; and the Niobrara Shale in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Our natural gas resource plays are the Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana and East Texas; and the Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania. On October 31, 2016, we conveyed our interests in the Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin of north central Texas. We also own oil and natural gas marketing and natural gas gathering and compression businesses. 
  Our Strategy 
  O  ur strategy is focused on creating shareholder value through the development of our significant positions in premier U.S. onshore resource plays. In addition, we will continue to focus our financial strategy on maximizing liquidity and improving margins. We continue to apply financial discipline to all aspects of our business with the goal of increasing financial and operational flexibility. Our capital program is focused o  n investments that can improve our cash flow generating ability regardless of the c  ommodity price environment. We are utilizing fewer rigs in 2016 than we utilized in 2015; however, to improve cash flow, we are increasing completion crews to capitalize on prior investments and generate revenues from initial production on new wells. In 2016, we have provided additional liquidity and sources of capital, primarily from the suspension of dividend payments on our convertible preferred stock, the amendment to our senior revolving credit facility, our convertible notes offering, our secured term loan facility and sales of assets that did not fit in our strategic priorities. In addition, we are strengthening our balance sheet and improving our liquidit  y position by continuing to exchange or repurchase, where possible at a discount, certain of our debt and preferred equity instruments. 
  Our substantial inventory of hydrocarbon resources, including our undeveloped acreage, provides a strong foundation to create future value. We have seen and continue to see increased efficiencies and operational improvements, in  cluding increased well productivity from larger completions and lower production declines due to a greater focus on strengthening our base production. We believe that these efficiencies, when combined with our improved liquidity position, reduced debt balances and improved cost structure, provide the opportunity to modestly increase our capital program in 2017. Building on our strong and diverse asset base through increasing production and cash flow and further delineating our emerging new development opportunities, we believe that our dedication to financial discipline, the flexibility of our capital program, and our continued focus on safety and enviro  nmental stewardship will provide opportunities to create value for Chesapeake and its stakeholders. 
  Operating Results 
  Our Current Quarter production of   59 mmboe   consisted of   8 mmbbls   of oil (  14%   on an oil equivalent basis),   268 bcf   of natural gas (  76%   on an oil equivalent basis) and   6 mmbbls   of NGL (  10%   on an oil equivalent basis). Our daily production for the Current Quarter averaged approximately   638 mboe  ,   a decrease   of   4%   from the Prior Quarter. Compared to the Prior Quarter, average daily oil production   decreased   by   24%  , or approximately   27 mbbls   per day; average daily natural gas production   increased   by   2%  , or approximately   56 mmcf   per day; and average daily NGL production   decreased   by   14%  , or approximately   10 mbbls   per day. Our oil and NGL production decreased primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our Mid-Continent assets in 2016 and 2015 as well as a significant reduction in drilling activity. Adjusted for asset sales, our total daily production increased 2% in the Current Quarter compared to the Prior Quarter. Our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues (excluding gains or losses on oil and natural gas derivatives)   decreased   approximately   $88 million   to   $1.048 billion   in the Current Quarter compared to   $1.136 billion   in the Prior Quarter, primarily due to significant decreases in the volumes of oil sold. See   Results of Operations   below for additional details.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

Our Current Period production of   180 mmboe   consisted of   25 mmbbls   of oil (  14%   on an oil equivalent basis),   814 bcf   of natural gas (  75%   on an oil equivalent basis), and   19 mmbbls   of NGL (  11%   on an oil equivalent basis). Our daily production for the Current Period averaged approximately   656 mboe  , a decrease of   4%   from the Prior Period. Compared to the Prior Period, average daily oil production   decreased   by   23%   or approximately   27 mbbls   per day; average daily natural gas production   increased   by   1%  , or approximately   32 mmcf   per day; and average daily NGL production   decreased   by   9%  , or approximately   7 mbbls   per day. Our oil and NGL production decreased primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our Mid-Continent assets in 2016 and 2015 as well as a significant reduction in drilling activity. Adjusted for asset sales, our total daily production increased 1% in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period. Our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues (excluding gains or losses on oil and natural gas derivatives)   decreased   approximately   $1.038 billion   to   $2.744 billion   in the Current Period compared to   $3.782 billion   in the Prior Period, primarily due to significant decreases in the prices received for oil, natural gas and NGL sold in addition to lower oil volumes sold. See   Results of Operations   below for additional details. 
  Capital Expenditures  
  Our drilling and completion capital expenditures during the Current Quarter were approximately   $332 million   and capital expenditures for the acquisition of unproved properties, geological and geophysical costs and other property and equipment were approximately   $21 million  , for a total of approximately   $353 million  . In the Current Quarter, we operated an average of   11   rigs, a   decrease   of   7   rigs, or   39%  , compared to the Prior Quarter. As a result of lower drilling and completion activity, drilling and completion expenditures   decreased   approximately   $135 million   in the Current Quarter compared to the Prior Quarter. The level of capital expenditures for the acquisition of unproved properties, geological and geophysical costs and other property and equipment   decreased   approximately   $36 million   compared to the Prior Quarter. 
  Our capitalized interest was approximately   $59 million   and   $99 million   in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively. The decrease in capitalized interest resulted from a lower average balance of our unproved oil and natural gas properties, the primary asset on which interest is capitalized. Including capitalized interest, total capital investments were approximately   $412 million   in the Current Quarter compared to   $623 million   for the Prior Quarter, a   decrease   of   34%  . 
  Our drilling and completion capital expenditures during the Current Period were approximately   $951 million   and capital expenditures for the acquisition of unproved properties, geological and geophysical costs and other property and equipment were approximately   $91 million  , for a total of approximately   $1.042 billion  . In the Current Period, we operated an average of   ten   rigs, a   decrease   of   23   rigs, or   70%  , compared to the Prior Period. As a result of lower drilling and completion activity, drilling and completion expenditures   decreased   approximately   $1.7 billion   in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period. The level of capital expenditures for the acquisition of unproved properties, geological and geophysical costs and other property and equipment   decreased   approximately   $85 million   compared to the Prior Period.  
  Our capitalized interest was approximately   $191 million   and   $336 million   in the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively. The decrease in capitalized interest resulted from a lower average balance of our unproved oil and natural gas properties, the primary asset on which interest is capitalized. Including capitalized interest, total capital investments were approximately   $1.233 billion   in the Current Period compared to   $3.1 billion   for the Prior Period, a   decrease   of   60%  . 
  Based on planned activity levels for the remainder of 2016, we project that 2016 capital expenditures for drilling and completions, leasehold, geological and geophysical and other property and equipment will be   $1.65 - $1.75 billion  , inclusive of capitalized interest. Additionally, we project that 2017 capital expenditures will be $1.82 - $2.62 billion. The   decrease   from the   $3.6 billion   spent in 2015 is primarily driven by reduced activity as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices during 2016. See   Liquidity and Capital Resources   for additional information on how we plan to fund our capital budget.

Strategic Developments 
  On October 31, 2016, we conveyed our interests in the Barnett Shale operating area located in north central Texas and received from the buyer aggregate net proceeds of approximately $218 million. We simultaneously terminated most of our future commitments associated with this asset. We sold approximately 212,000 net developed and undeveloped acres and approximately 2,800 operated wells, which produced an average of approximately 59 mboe per day in the Current Quarter, along with other property and equipment. In connection with this transaction, we paid   $334 million   to terminate a natural gas gathering agreement associated with the Barnett Shale assets. We also may be required to pay an additional $70 million in respect of certain title and environmental contingencies. Additionally, certain of our other property and equipment, including buildings, surface land, compressors and office equipment, qualified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . We have recognized an impairment charge of   $282 million   in the Current Quarter related to these assets representing the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets, less the anticipated costs to sell. By exiting the Barnett Shale, we eliminated approximately $1.9 billion of total future midstream and downstream commitments, leading to an expected increase in our operating income for the remainder of 2016 through 2019 of $200 to $300 million annually. In addition, our exit increased the value of our proved reserves. 
  In September 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the majority of our upstream and midstream assets in the Devonian Shale located in West Virginia and Kentucky. We agreed to sell approximately 882,000 net acres and approximately 5,600 wells along with related gathering assets, and other property, plant and equipment. In connection with this divestiture, we will be required to purchase one of our remaining VPP transactions. All of the acquired interests will be conveyed in our divestiture discussed above and we will no longer have any future obligations related to this VPP. After the repurchase of this VPP, we expect net cash proceeds to be nominal. 
  In October 2016, we signed a letter of intent to restructure our natural gas gathering and service agreement in our Powder River Basin operating area with Williams   Partners, L.P. (Williams)   and Crestwood Equity Partners L.P. The restructured services are expected to replace the current cost-of-service arrangement and improve economics which support increased development across an expanded area of dedication in the region. Subject to board approvals from all three companies of the definitive agreement, the restructured services are to become effective January 1, 2017, for a 20-year term. 
  In October 2016, we repurchased in the open market approximately   $105 million   principal amount of our outstanding debt scheduled to mature or that could be put to us in 2017 and 2018 for   $106 million  . 
  In October 2016, we issued in a private placement   $1.25 billion   principal amount of unsecured   5.5%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. The notes will be convertible, under certain specified circumstances, into cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election. On or after September 15, 2019, we may redeem for cash all or part of the notes at par plus accrued interest if our common stock trades above 130% of the conversion price for a specified period. We are using the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include debt repurchases and the repayment of our revolving credit facility and senior notes with near-term maturities as they become due. 
  In October 2016, we completed private exchanges of an aggregate of approximately   110.3 million   shares of our common stock for (i)   134,000   shares of   5.00%   Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (Series 2005B), (ii)   606,271   shares of   5.75%   Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and (iii)   553,007   shares of   5.75%   Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A). This amount of preferred stock represents approximately $1.2 billion of liquidation value, which was exchanged at a discount of over 40%. 
  In the Current Quarter, we entered into a secured   five  -year term loan facility in aggregate principal amount of   $1.5 billion   for net proceeds of approximately   $1.482 billion  .   We   used the proceeds from our term loan to purchase and retire   $898 million   principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and   $708 million   principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for an aggregate   $1.5 billion   pursuant to tender offers. We recognized an aggregate gain of   $87 million   associated with these debt retirements. 
  In the Current Quarter, we renegotiated our natural gas gathering agreement with Williams in our Mid-Continent operating area in exchange for a $66 million payment. This amount will be amortized to oil, natural gas and NGL gathering, processing and transportation expense over the life of the agreement. 
  In the Current Quarter, we accelerated the value of a long-term natural gas supply contract for $146 million in cash proceeds.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

In the Current Period, we further amended our revolving credit facility agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, our borrowing base was reaffirmed in the amount of   $4.0 billion   and our next scheduled borrowing base redetermination date was postponed until June 15, 2017, with the consenting lenders agreeing not to exercise their interim redetermination right prior to that date. The amendment also modifies the credit agreement to provide for, among other things, (i) the suspension or modification of certain financial covenants, and (ii) the granting of liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets, including mortgages encumbering 90% of our proved oil and gas properties that constitute borrowing base properties, all hedge contracts and personal property subject to certain agreed upon carve outs.   See Note 3 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I for further discussion of the terms of our revolving credit facility. 
  In the Current Period, in addition to the tender offers described above and the repayment upon maturity of   $259 million   principal amount of our   3.25%   Senior Notes due 2016, we repurchased in the open market approximately   $181 million   principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for   $151 million   and   $118 million   principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for   $63 million  . Additionally, we privately negotiated exchanges of approximately   $290 million   principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for   53,923,925   shares of our common stock and   $287 million   principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for   55,427,782   shares of our common stock. We recorded an aggregate   gain   of approximately $168 million associated with these debt purchases and exchanges. 
  In the Current Period, we amended certain of our firm transportation agreements in the Haynesville, Barnett and Eagle Ford operating areas, which will reduce our firm transportation volume commitments and fees. We estimate a benefit of approximately $650 million gross ($415 million net) over the term of the contracts, including $80 million gross ($50 million net) in lower unused demand charges for the underutilized capacity and lower transportation fees in 2016. 
  In the Current Period, we sold certain of our noncore assets for net proceeds of approximately   $988 million   after post-closing adjustments. Additional consideration of approximately $106 million was withheld subject to certain title, environmental and other standard contingencies. We expect the majority of the amount subject to the hold back will be received. In conjunction with certain of these sales, we purchased four of our VPP transactions for approximately $259 million. A majority of the acquired interests were part of the asset divestitures discussed above and we no longer have any further commitments or obligations related to these VPPs. The asset divestitures cover various operating areas. We continue to pursue the sale of assets that do not fit in our strategic priorities. 
  In the Current Period, we suspended dividend payments on our convertible preferred stock to provide additional liquidity in the currently depressed commodity environment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity Overview 
  Our ability to   grow,   make capital expenditures and service our debt depends primarily upon the prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGL we sell. Substantial expenditures are required to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been very volatile, and may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The substantial decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices from 2014 levels has negatively affected the amount of cash we have available for capital expenditures and debt service. A substantial or extended decline in o  il, natural gas and NGL prices could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and on the quantities of reserves that we may economically produce.   Other risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity include, but are not limited to, counterparty credit risk for our receivables, access to capital markets, regulatory risks and our ability to meet financial ratios and covenants in our financing agreements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a cash balance of approximately   $4 million   compared to   $825 million   as of December 31, 2015, and we had a net working capital deficit of approximately   $2.539 billion  , compared to a net working capital deficit of approximately   $1.205 billion   as of December 31, 2015. We made significant progress in the Current Period to reduce near-term debt maturities, including reducing our 2017 debt maturities by $1.230 billion, or 65%, and our 2018 debt maturities by $211 million, or 24%. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $3.051 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility, with   $240 million   of outstanding borrowings and   $709 million   utilized for various letters of credit (including   the   $461 million   supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes litigation)  . See Note 3 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion of our debt obligations, including principal and carrying amounts of our notes.   Based on our cash balance, forecasted cash flows from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility, we expect to be able to fund our planned capital expenditures budget, meet our debt service requirements and fund our other commitments and obligations for the next 12 months. 
  In the Current Period, we have taken the following measures to improve liquidity: 
             
    entered into a secured five-year term loan facility in aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, using the proceeds to retire $898 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and $708 million principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes; 
                
    exchanged 109.4 million shares of common stock for $577 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes; 
                
    repurchased $299 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible notes in the open market; 
                
    further amended our revolving credit agreement to reaffirm our borrowing base, postpone our next scheduled borrowing base redetermination date and modify or suspend certain credit agreement financial covenants; 
                
    mitigated a portion of our downside exposure to commodity prices through derivative contracts, suspended dividend payments on our convertible preferred stock and divested assets to increase our liquidity. 
     Additionally, during October 2016, we issued $1.25 billion principal amount of unsecured 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, exchanged 110.3 million shares of common stock for $1.2 billion liquidation value of our preferred stock, reducing $67 million of annual dividend obligations, and repurchased in the open market approximately   $105 million   principal amount of our outstanding debt scheduled to mature or that could be put to us in 2017 and 2018 for   $106 million  . 
  Even though we have taken measures outlined above to mitigate the liquidity concerns facing us for the next 12 months, there can be no assurance that these measures will satisfy our needs. We may continue to access the capital markets or otherwise incur debt to refin  ance a portion of our outstanding indebtedness and improve our li  q  uidity.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

As operator of a substantial portion of our oil and natural gas properties under development, we have significant control and flexibility over the development plan and the associated timing, enabling us to reduce at least a portion of our capital spending as needed. Our forecasted 2016 capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized interest, are     $1.65 - $1.75 billion  , and our 2017 capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized interest, are $1.82 - $2.62 billion, both significant reductions from our 2015 capital spending level of   $3.6 billion  .   We currently plan to use cash flow from operations and cash on hand to fund our remaining capital expenditures during 2016 and   we expect to generate additional liquidity with proceeds from future sales of assets that we determine do not fit our strategic priorities.   In addition, we had liquidity (calculated as cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility) of approximately $3.7 billion as of November 1, 2016.   Management continues to review operational plans for the remainder of 2016 and beyond, which could result in changes to projected capital expenditures and revenues from sales of oil, natural gas and NGL. We closely monitor the amounts and timing of our sources and uses of funds, particularly as they affect our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility. 
  Some of our counterparties have requested or required us to post collateral as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements, such as gathering, processing, transportation and hedging agreements. As of November 1, 2016, we have received requests and posted approximately $345 million in collateral under such arrangements (excluding the supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes). We may be requested or required by other counterparties to post additional collateral in an aggregate amount of approximately $670 million, which may be in the form of additional letters of credit, cash or other acceptable collateral. However, we have substantial long-term business relationships with each of these counterparties, and we may be able to mitigate any collateral requests through ongoing business arrangements and by offsetting amounts that the counterparty owes us. Any posting of collateral consisting of cash or letters of credit reduces availability under our revolving credit facility and negatively impacts our liquidity.  
  In addition, during the next 12 months, we may be required to pay up to   $440 million   in connection with the judgment against us related to the redemption at par value of our 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019. In connection with our appeal of the decision by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York regarding the redemption, we posted a supersedeas bond in the amount of   $461 million   in July 2015, which is reflected as an outstanding letter of credit under our revolving credit facility. This contingent payment is fully accrued on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. See Note 4 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this report for further discussion of the recent developments in this litigation. 
  To add more certainty to our future estimated cash flows by mitigating our downside exposure to lower commodity prices, as of November 1, 2016, we have downside   price   protection, through open swaps, on approximately 67% of our projected remaining 2016 oil production at an average price of $46.84 per bbl. We also have downside price protection, through open swaps and collars, on approximately 79% of our projected remaining 2016 natural gas production at an average price of $2.86 per mcf, of which 7% is hedged under two-way collar arrangements based on an average bought put NYMEX price of $3.00 per mcf. In addition, in exchange for a higher price on certain of our oil and natural gas swaps, we have sold c  ertain call options that allow the counterparty to double the notional amount on existing fixed-price swaps. We also have downside price protection,   through open swaps, on approximately 18% of our projected remaining 2016 NGL production at average prices of $0.17 per gallon of ethane and $0.46 per gallon of propane.   In addition, for 2017 we have downside price protection on approximately 52% of our projected 2017 oil production at an average price of $49.68 per bbl and we have downside price protection, on approximately 63% of our projected 2017 natural gas production at an average price of $3.07 per mcf, of which 3% is hedged under two-way collar arrangements based on an average bought put NYMEX price of $3.00 per mcf.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

Sources of Funds 
  The following table presents the sources of our cash and cash equivalents for   the Current Period   and   the Prior Period  . 

Cash provided by operating activities was   $50 million   in   the Current Period   compared to   $1.055 billion   of cash provided by operating activities in   the Prior Period  . The decrease is primarily the result of lower realized prices for the oil, natural gas and NGL we sold in addition to decreases in the volumes of oil and NGL sold, partially offset by decreases in certain of our operating expenses. Changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income, excluding various non-cash items such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairments, gains or losses on sales of fixed assets, deferred income taxes and mark-to-market changes in our derivative instruments. See further discussion below under   Results of Operations  . 
  We currently plan to use cash flow from operations, cash on hand and our revolving credit facility to fund our capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 and for 2017.   We expect to generate additional liquidity with proceeds from future sales of assets that we determine do not fit our strategic priorities. W  e borrowed   $5.097 billion   and repaid   $4.857 billion   under our revolving credit facility in the Current Period and had no borrowings or repayments in the Prior Period.

Uses of Funds 
  The following table presents the uses of our cash and cash equivalents for   the Current Period   and   the Prior Period  :    

___________________________________________ 
           (a) 
    Net of $51 million in drilling and completion carries received from our joint venture partners during   the Prior Period  . 
     Our primary use of funds is for drilling and completion costs on our oil and natural gas properties. Our drilling and completion costs decreased in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period primarily as a result of significantly decreased activity. During   the Current Period  , our average operated rig count was   ten   rigs compared to an average operated rig count of   33   rigs in   the Prior Period  . Additionally, we used funds to acquire proved and unproved properties. Our acquisitions of proved and unproved properties increased in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period primarily resulting from purchases of oil and natural gas interests previously sold to third parties in connection with four of our VPP transactions for approximately   $259 million  .      
  In   the Current Period  , we used   $1.979 billion   of cash to reduce $2.164 billion principal amount of debt. In addition to the repayment at maturity of   $259 million   principal amount of our 3.25% Senior Notes due 2016, we repurchased in the open market approximately   $118 million   principal amount of our   2.5%   Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 (2037 Notes) (that could have been put to us in May 2017) for   $63 million  , $122 million principal amount of our 3.25% Senior Notes due 2016 for $115 million (prior to maturity) and $59 million principal amount of our 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 for $36 million. Additionally in the Current Period, we used the proceeds from our term loan facility to purchase and retire   $898 million   principal amount of our senior notes and   $708 million   principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes for an aggregate   $1.5 billion   pursuant to tender offers. 
  We paid dividends on our preferred stock of   $128 million   in   the Prior Period   and we paid dividends on our common stock of   $118 million   in   the Prior Period  . We eliminated common stock dividends effective in the 2015 third quarter and suspended preferred stock dividends effective in the 2016 first quarter.

Term Loan Facility 
  In the Current Quarter, we entered into a secured   five  -year term loan facility in aggregate principal amount of   $1.5 billion   for net proceeds of approximately   $1.482 billion  . Our obligations under the new facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our revolving credit facility and are secured by first-priority liens on the same collateral securing our revolving credit facility (with a position in the collateral proceeds waterfall junior to the revolving credit facility). The term loan bears interest at a rate of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 7.50% per annum, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor, or the Alternative Base Rate (ABR) plus 6.50% per annum, subject to a 2.00% ABR floor, at our option. The loan was made at par without original discount. We used the net proceeds to finance tender offers for our unsecured notes.   The term loan matures in August 2021 and is subject to a make-whole premium prior to the second anniversary of the closing of the term loan, a premium to par of 4.25% from the second anniversary until but excluding the third anniversary, a premium to par of 2.125% from the third anniversary until but excluding the fourth anniversary and at par beginning on the fourth anniversary. The term loan may be subject to mandatory prepayments and offers to prepay with net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt, certain sales and other dispositions of collateral.   See Note 3 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I for further discussion of the term loan facility. 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  We have a   $4.0 billion   senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in December 2019. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $240 million   of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had used   $709 million   of the revolving credit facility for various letters of credit (including the   $461 million   supersedeas bond with respect to the 2019 Notes litigation). See   Liquidity Overview   above for additional information on our collateral postings. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a variable rate. We are required to secure our obligations under the facility with liens on certain of our oil and natural gas properties, with the liens to be released upon the satisfaction of specific conditions. The applicable interest rates under the facility fluctuate based on the percentage of the borrowing base used. In the Current Period, we amended our revolving credit facility to provide covenant relief and affirm our $4.0 billion borrowing base. Our borrowing base may be reduced if we dispose of a certain percentage of the value of the collateral securing the facility. As a result of asset sales discussed in Note 16 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I and all other sales of collateral since the date of the most recent amendment, as of October 31, 2016, our borrowing base was reduced to   $3.8 billion  . See Note 3 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I for further discussion of the terms of the revolving credit facility and the amendment. As of   September 30, 2016  , our interest coverage ratio was approximately 2.19 to 1.0. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the credit agreement.  
  Hedging Arrangements 
  In February 2016, our multi-counterparty secured hedging facility was terminated and all liens on the collateral securing the hedging facility were released. In April 2015, we began using bilateral hedging arrangements. For discussion of our bilateral hedging agreements, see Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report.

Credit Risk 
  Derivative instruments that enable us to manage our exposure to oil, natural gas and NGL prices, as well as to interest rate and foreign currency volatility, expose us to credit risk from our counterparties. To mitigate this risk, we enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are rated investment grade and deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers, and we attempt to limit our exposure to non-performance by any single counterparty. As of   September 30, 2016  , our oil, natural gas, NGL and interest rate derivative instruments were spread among   13   counterparties. Additionally, the counterparties under our commodity hedging arrangements are required to secure their obligations in excess of defined thresholds. 
  Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil, natural gas and NGL ($686 million as of   September 30, 2016  ) and exploration and production companies that own interests in properties we operate ($145 million as of   September 30, 2016  ). This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit or parent guarantees for receivables from parties which are judged to have sub-standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. During the Current Quarter, the Prior Quarter,   the Current Period   and   the Prior Period  , we recognized $1 million, $1 million, $5 million and $3 million, respectively, of bad debt expense related to potentially uncollectible receivables.  
  Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  From time to time, we enter into arrangements and transactions that can give rise to contractual obligations and off-balance sheet commitments. As of   September 30, 2016  , these arrangements and transactions included (i) operating lease agreements, (ii) volumetric production payments (VPPs) (to purchase production and pay related production expenses and taxes in the future), (iii) open purchase commitments, (iv) open delivery commitments, (v) open drilling commitments, (vi) undrawn letters of credit, (vii) open gathering and transportation commitments, and (viii) various other commitments we enter into in the ordinary course of business that could result in a future cash obligation. See Notes 4 and 9 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this report for further discussion of commitments and VPPs, respectively. 
   
  Results of Operations   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. September 30, 2015 
  General  . For the Current Quarter, Chesapeake had   a net loss   of   $1.154 billion  , or   $1.54   per diluted common share, on total revenues of   $2.276 billion  . This compares to   a net loss   of   $4.639 billion  , or   $7.08   per diluted common share, on total revenues of   $3.376 billion   for the Prior Quarter. The net losses in the Current Quarter were primarily driven by impairments of fixed assets and other and oil and natural gas properties while the net losses in the Prior Quarter were primarily driven by impairments of our oil and natural gas properties. See   Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties   and   Impairments of Fixed Assets and Other   below.  
  Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Sales  . During the Current Quarter, oil, natural gas and NGL sales were   $1.177 billion   compared to   $1.363 billion   in the Prior Quarter. In the Current Quarter, Chesapeake sold   59 mmboe   for   $1.048 billion   at a weighted average price of   $17.86   per boe (excluding the effect of derivatives), compared to   61 mmboe   sold in the Prior Quarter for   $1.136 billion   at a weighted average price of   $18.52   per boe (excluding the effect of derivatives). The   decrease   in the price received per boe in the Current Quarter compared to the Prior Quarter resulted in a $40 million decrease in revenues, and decreased sales volumes resulted in a $48 million decrease in revenues, for a total   decrease   in revenues of   $88 million   (excluding the effect of derivatives). 
  For the Current Quarter, our average price received per barrel of oil (excluding the effect of derivatives) was   $42.94  , compared to   $44.60   in the Prior Quarter. Natural gas prices received per mcf (excluding the effect of derivatives) were   $2.32   in the Current Quarter and   $2.25   in the Prior Quarter. NGL prices received per barrel (excluding the effect of derivatives) were   $13.93   in the Current Quarter and   $10.90   in the Prior Quarter. 
  Gains from our oil and natural gas derivatives resulted in net increases in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues of   $129 million   and   $227 million   in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively. See Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   in Part I of this report for a complete listing of all of our derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016  .

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

A change in oil, natural gas and NGL prices has a significant impact on our revenues and cash flows. Assuming our Current Quarter production levels and without considering the effect of derivatives, an increase or decrease of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in Current Quarter revenues of approximately $8 million, an increase or decrease of $0.10 per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in Current Quarter revenues of approximately $27 million and an increase or decrease of $1.00 per barrel of NGL sold would result in an increase or decrease Current Quarter revenues of $6 million. 
  The following tables show production and average sales prices received by our operating divisions for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter:

           (a) 
    Average sales prices exclude gains (losses) on derivatives. 
              (b) 
    Our Southern Division includes the Eagle Ford and Anadarko Basin liquids plays and the Haynesville/Bossier and Barnett natural gas shale plays. The Eagle Ford Shale accounted for approximately 24% of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2015. Eagle Ford Shale production for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter was 9.2 mmboe and 9.9 mmboe, respectively.  
              (c) 
    Our Northern Division includes the Utica and Niobrara liquids plays and the Marcellus natural gas play. The Utica Shale accounted for approximately 18% of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2015. Utica Shale production for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter was 11.7 mmboe and 9.7 mmboe, respectively. The Marcellus Shale accounted for approximately 17% of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2015. In both the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, Marcellus Shale production was 12.4 mmboe. 
     Our average daily production of   638 mboe   for the Current Quarter consisted of approximately   87 mbbls   of oil (  14%   on an oil equivalent basis), approximately   3 bcf   of natural gas (  76%   on an oil equivalent basis) and approximately   66 mbbls   of NGL (  10%   on an oil equivalent basis). Oil production   decreased   by   24%   year over year primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our Mid-Continent assets in 2016 and 2015 as well as a significant reduction in drilling activity. Natural gas production   increased   by   2%   and NGL production   decreased   by   14%  .  
  Excluding the impact of derivatives, our percentage of revenues from oil, natural gas and NGL is shown in the following table:

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

Marketing, Gathering and Compression Revenues and Expenses  . Marketing, gathering and compression revenues consist of third-party revenues as well as fair value adjustments on our supply contract derivatives (see Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for additional information on our supply contract derivatives). Expenses related to our marketing, gathering and compression operations consist of third-party expenses and exclude depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments of fixed assets and other, net gains or losses on sales of fixed assets and interest expense. See   Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets   below for the depreciation and amortization recorded on our marketing, gathering and compression assets. Chesapeake recognized   $1.099 billion   in marketing, gathering and compression revenues in the Current Quarter, of which   $146 million   related to cash proceeds from the sale of our long-term natural gas supply contract to a third party offset by the reversal of the cumulative unrealized gains of   $280 million  , with corresponding expenses of   $1.261 billion  , for a   net loss   of   $162 million  . This compares to revenues of   $2.013 billion  , of which   $70 million   related to unrealized gains on the fair value of our supply contract derivative, with corresponding expenses of   $1.955 billion  , for a   net margin   before depreciation of   $58 million   in the Prior Quarter. Revenues and expenses decreased in the Current Quarter compared to the Prior Quarter primarily as a result of lower volumes on certain sales contracts with third parties entered into to help meet certain of our oil pipeline and other commitments. 
  Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Production Expenses  . Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were   $164 million   in the Current Quarter, compared to   $251 million   in the Prior Quarter. On a unit-of-production basis, production expenses were   $2.80   per boe in the Current Quarter compared to   $4.09   per boe in the Prior Quarter. The absolute and per unit   decrease   in the Current Quarter was primarily the result of a reduction in repair and maintenance expenses as well as operating efficiencies across most of our operating areas. Production expenses in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter included approximately $10 million and $25 million, or $0.17 and $0.41 per boe, respectively, associated with VPP production volumes. We anticipate a continued decrease in production expenses associated with VPP production volumes as the contractually scheduled volumes under our VPP agreements decrease and operating efficiencies generally improve. Additionally, in connection with certain divestitures in the Current Period, we purchased the remaining oil and natural gas interests previously sold in connection with four of our VPPs and a majority of the oil and natural gas interests purchased were subsequently sold. In addition, one of our VPPs expired in 2015.  
  Oil, Natural Gas, and NGL Gathering, Processing and Transportation Expenses.   Oil, natural gas and NGL gathering, processing and transportation expenses were   $473 million   in the Current Quarter compared to   $483 million   in the Prior Quarter. On a unit-of-production basis, gathering, processing and transportation expenses were   $8.07   per boe in the Current Quarter compared to   $7.88   per boe in the Prior Quarter. Certain of our gathering agreements require us to pay the service provider a fee for any production shortfall below certain annual minimum gathering volume commitments. A summary of oil, natural gas and NGL gathering, processing and transportation expenses by product is shown below. 

Production Taxes  . Production taxes were   $17 million   in the Current Quarter compared to   $25 million   in the Prior Quarter. On a unit-of-production basis, production taxes were   $0.29   per boe in the Current Quarter compared to   $0.42   per boe in the Prior Quarter. In general, production taxes are calculated using value-based formulas that produce lower per unit costs when oil, natural gas and NGL prices are lower. The absolute and per unit decrease in production taxes in the Current Quarter was primarily due to lower prices received for oil. Production taxes in both the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter included approximately $1 million, or $0.02 and $0.01 per boe, respectively, associated with VPP production volumes.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

General and Administrative Expenses  . General and administrative expenses were   $63 million   in the Current Quarter and   $49 million   in the Prior Quarter, or   $1.08   and   $0.79   per boe, respectively. The absolute and per unit expense   increase   in the Current Quarter was primarily due to less overhead billed to our partners resulting from certain divestitures in 2015 and 2016. In addition, in the Current Quarter, we recorded positive fair value adjustments to PSUs granted to executives of the Company, which were primarily the result of an increase in the trading price of our common stock. 
  Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with oil and natural gas property acquisition, drilling and completion activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with the acquisition of leasehold, as well as drilling and completion activities, and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $38 million of internal costs in the Current Quarter and $43 million in the Prior Quarter, respectively, directly related to our leasehold acquisition and drilling and completion efforts. 
  Restructuring and Other Termination Costs.   We recorded an   expense   of   $53 million   in the Prior Quarter for restructuring and other termination costs. In the Prior Quarter, we reduced our workforce by approximately 15% as part of an overall plan to reduce costs and better align our workforce with the needs of our business and current oil and natural gas commodity prices. In connection with the reduction, we incurred a total charge of approximately $55 million for one-time termination benefits, all of which were paid in cash in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, the Prior Quarter included negative fair value adjustments to PSUs granted to former executives of the Company, which were primarily the result of a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. 
  Provision for Legal Contingencies.   In the Current Quarter, we recorded   $8 million   for legal contingencies. The Current Quarter provision consists of accruals for loss contingencies primarily related to royalty claims. See Note 4 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion of royalty claims.  
  Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization  . Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) of oil, natural gas and NGL properties was   $255 million   and   $488 million   in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively. The average DD A rate per boe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was   $4.35   and   $7.95   in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively. The absolute and per unit   decrease   in the Current Quarter was the result of a lower amortization base, which is due to the 2015 and 2016 impairments of our oil and natural gas properties. 
  Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets  . Depreciation and amortization of other assets was   $25 million   in the Current Quarter compared to   $31 million   in the Prior Quarter. On a unit-of-production basis, depreciation and amortization of other assets was   $0.42   per boe in the Current Quarter compared to   $0.51   per boe in the Prior Quarter. Property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows depreciation expense by asset class for the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter and the estimated useful lives of these assets.

Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties.   Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to quarterly full cost ceiling tests. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. For the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling, resulting in impairments of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties of   $433 million   and   $5.416 billion  , respectively. Cash flow hedges related to future periods increased the ceiling test impairment by   $154 million   and   $184 million   in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the present value of estimated future net revenue of our proved reserves, discounted at an annual rate of 10%, was $3.819 billion. Estimated future net revenue represents the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production, gathering, processing, transportation and future development costs, using prices and costs under existing economic conditions as of that date. The prices used in the present value calculation as of   September 30, 2016   were $41.68 per bbl of oil and $2.28 per mcf of natural gas, before price differential adjustments. 
  Impairments of Fixed Assets and Other.   In the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, we recognized   $751 million   and   $79 million  , respectively, of fixed asset impairment losses and other charges. On October 31, 2016, we conveyed our interests in the Barnett Shale operating area located in north central Texas and simultaneously terminated most of our future commitments associated with this asset. In connection with this transaction, we accrued   $334 million   of charges in the Current Quarter related to the termination of a natural gas gathering agreement associated with the Barnett Shale assets. Additionally, certain of our other property and equipment, including buildings, surface land, compressors and office equipment, qualified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . We have recognized an impairment charge of   $282 million   in the Current Quarter related to these assets representing the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets, less the anticipated costs to sell. Also in the Current Quarter, we have entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the majority of our upstream and midstream assets in the Devonian Shale located in West Virginia and Kentucky. Additionally, certain of our other property and equipment, including gathering systems, natural gas compressors and buildings and land, qualified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016. We have recognized an impairment charge of   $134 million   in the Current Quarter for these assets for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets, less the anticipated costs to sell. The Prior Quarter amount consisted of a $70 million settlement charge for a net acreage maintenance obligation to Total S.A. in our Barnett Shale joint venture and a $9 million impairment of a note receivable. 
  Net Gains on Sales of Fixed Assets.   We recorded   net gains   on sales of fixed assets of   $1 million   in the Prior Quarter. The amount primarily related to the sale of buildings, land and other property and equipment.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

Interest Expense  . Interest expense was   $73 million   in the Current Quarter compared to   $88 million   in the Prior Quarter as follows: 

___________________________________________ 
           (a) 
    Includes settlements related to the interest accrual for the current period and the effect of (gains) losses on early-terminated trades. Settlements of early-terminated trades are reflected in realized (gains) losses over the original life of the hedged item. 
              (b) 
    Includes changes in the fair value of open interest rate derivatives offset by amounts reclassified to realized (gains) losses during the current period. 
     The decrease in capitalized interest resulted from a lower average balance of unproved oil and natural gas properties, the primary asset on which interest is capitalized. The decrease in senior note interest expense is primarily due to $41 million of interest on our second lien notes being accounted for as a reduction in the carrying value of debt instead of interest expense as a result of troubled debt restructuring accounting rules. Interest expense, excluding unrealized gains or losses on interest rate derivatives and net of amounts capitalized, was   $1.20   per boe in the Current Quarter and   $1.41   per boe in the Prior Quarter. 
  Losses on Investments.     Losses   on investments of   $1 million   in the Current Quarter were related to our equity investment in Sundrop Fuels, Inc.   Losses   on investments of   $33 million   in the Prior Quarter were primarily related to our equity investments in FTS International, Inc. and Sundrop Fuels, Inc. 
  Gains   on Purchases or Exchanges of Deb  t. In the Current Quarter, we used the proceeds from our $1.5 billion term loan facility to purchase and retire   $898 million   principal amount of our senior notes and   $708 million   principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes for an aggregate   $1.5 billion   pursuant to tender offers. We recognized an aggregate gain of   $87 million   associated with these transactions. 
  Other Income (Expense)  . Other income was   $7 million   in the Current Quarter and consisted of $1 million of interest income and $6 million of miscellaneous income. In the Prior Quarter, we recorded   $2 million   of other expense that consisted of $2 million of interest income and $4 million of miscellaneous expense. 
  Income Tax Benefit.   Chesapeake recorded an income tax   benefit   of   $937 million   in the Prior Quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 0.0% in the Current Quarter and 16.8% in the Prior Quarter. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from the Prior Quarter to the Current Quarter is primarily due to the tax benefit at expected rates being fully offset by a valuation allowance. Further, our effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences. See Note 12 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for a discussion of income taxes.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.   Chesapeake recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of   $1 million   and   $13 million   in the Current Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively. The Current Quarter amount was attributable to the Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust (the Trust). The Prior Quarter amount was primarily related to dividends paid on preferred stock of our CHK C-T subsidiary. The decrease from the Prior Quarter to the Current Quarter is due to the repurchase of all of the preferred shares of CHK C-T from third-party shareholders in August 2015. 
   
  Results of Operations   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. September 30, 2015 
  General  . For the Current Period, Chesapeake had   a net loss   of   $3.825 billion  , or   $5.47   per diluted common share, on total revenues of   $5.851 billion  . This compares to   a net loss   of   $12.450 billion  , or   $19.07   per diluted common share, on total revenues of   $10.115 billion   for the Prior Period. The net losses in the Current Period were primarily driven by impairments of fixed assets and other and oil and natural gas properties while the net losses in the Prior Period were primarily driven by impairments of our oil and natural gas properties. See   Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties   and   Impairments of Fixed Assets and Other   below.  
  Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Sales  . During the Current Period, oil, natural gas and NGL sales were   $2.610 billion   compared to   $4.122 billion   in the Prior Period. In the Current Period, Chesapeake sold   180 mmboe   for   $2.744 billion   at a weighted average price of   $15.27   per boe (excluding the effect of derivatives), compared to   187 mmboe   sold in the Prior Period for   $3.782 billion   at a weighted average price of   $20.21   per boe (excluding the effect of derivatives). The   decrease   in the price received per boe in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period resulted in a $149 million decrease in revenues, and decreased sales volumes resulted in an $889 million decrease in revenues, for a total   decrease   in revenues of   $1.038 billion   (excluding the effect of derivatives). 
  For the Current Period, our average price received per barrel of oil (excluding the effect of derivatives) was   $38.21  , compared to   $47.90   in the Prior Period. Natural gas prices received per mcf (excluding the effect of derivatives) were   $1.90   in the Current Period and   $2.41   in the Prior Period. NGL prices received per barrel (excluding the effect of derivatives) were   $12.90   in the Current Period and   $14.06   in the Prior Period. 
  Gains and losses from our oil and natural gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues of   $134 million   in the Current Period and a net increase of   $340 million   in the Prior Period, respectively. See Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   in Part I of this report for a complete listing of all of our derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  A change in oil, natural gas and NGL prices has a significant impact on our revenues and cash flows. Assuming our Current Period production levels and without considering the effect of derivatives, an increase or decrease of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in Current Period revenues of approximately $24 million, an increase or decrease of $0.10 per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in Current Period revenues of approximately $81 million and an increase or decrease of $1.00 per barrel of NGL sold would result in an increase or decrease Current Period revenues of $19 million.

    Our Southern Division includes the Eagle Ford and Anadarko Basin liquids plays and the Haynesville/Bossier and Barnett natural gas shale plays. The Eagle Ford Shale accounted for approximately 24% of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2015. Eagle Ford Shale production for the Current Period and the Prior Period was 25.9 mmboe and 29.7 mmboe, respectively.  
              (c) 
    Our Northern Division includes the Utica and Niobrara liquids plays and the Marcellus natural gas play. The Utica Shale accounted for approximately 18% of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2015. Utica Shale production for the Current Period and the Prior Period was 36.7 mmboe and 30.9 mmboe, respectively. The Marcellus Shale accounted for approximately 17% of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2015. In both the Current Period and the Prior Period, Marcellus Shale production was 37.7 mmboe. 
     Our average daily production of   656 mboe   for the Current Period consisted of approximately   91 mbbls   of oil (  14%   on an oil equivalent basis), approximately   3 bcf   of natural gas (  75%   on an oil equivalent basis) and approximately   70 mbbls   of NGL (  11%   on an oil equivalent basis). Oil production   decreased   by   23%   year over year primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our Mid-Continent assets in 2016 and 2015 as well as a significant reduction in drilling activity. Natural gas production   increased   by   1%   and NGL production   decreased   by   9%  .  
  Excluding the impact of derivatives, our percentage of revenues from oil, natural gas and NGL is shown in the following table:

Marketing, Gathering and Compression Revenues and Expenses  . Marketing, gathering and compression revenues consist of third-party revenues as well as fair value adjustments on our supply contract derivatives (see Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for additional information on our supply contract derivatives). Expenses related to our marketing, gathering and compression operations consist of third-party expenses and exclude depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments of fixed assets and other, net gains or losses on sales of fixed assets and interest expense. See   Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets   below for the depreciation and amortization recorded on our marketing, gathering and compression assets. We recognized   $3.241 billion   in marketing, gathering and compression revenues in the Current Period, of which $146 million related to cash proceeds from the sale of our long-term natural gas supply contract to a third party offset by the reversal of cumulative unrealized gains of   $297 million  , with corresponding expenses of   $3.410 billion  , for a   net loss   of   $169 million  . This compares to revenues of   $5.993 billion  , of which   $290 million   related to unrealized gains on the fair value of our supply contract derivative, with corresponding expenses of   $5.751 billion  , for a   net margin   of   $242 million   in the Prior Period. Revenues and expenses decreased in the Current Period compared to the Prior Period primarily as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices paid and received in our marketing operations. 
  Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Production Expenses  . Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were   $552 million   in the Current Period, compared to   $826 million   in the Prior Period. On a unit-of-production basis, production expenses were   $3.07   per boe in the Current Period compared to   $4.42   per boe in the Prior Period. The absolute and per unit   decrease   in the Current Period was primarily the result of a reduction in repair and maintenance expenses as well as operating efficiencies across most of our operating areas. Production expenses in the Current Period and the Prior Period included approximately $38 million and $89 million, or $0.21 and $0.47 per boe, respectively, associated with VPP production volumes. We anticipate a continued decrease in production expenses associated with VPP production volumes as the contractually scheduled volumes under our VPP agreements decrease and operating efficiencies generally improve. Additionally, in connection with certain divestitures in the Current Period we purchased the remaining oil and natural gas interests previously sold in connection with four of our VPPs and a majority of the oil and natural gas interests repurchased were subsequently sold. In addition, one of our VPPs expired in 2015.  
  Oil, Natural Gas, and NGL Gathering, Processing and Transportation Expenses.   Oil, natural gas and NGL gathering, processing and transportation expenses were   $1.436 billion   in the Current Period compared to   $1.429 billion   in the Prior Period. On a unit-of-production basis, gathering, processing and transportation expenses were   $7.99   per boe in the Current Period compared to   $7.64   per boe in the Prior Period. Certain of our gathering agreements require us to pay the service provider a fee for any production shortfall below certain annual minimum gathering volume commitments. A summary of oil, natural gas and NGL gathering, processing and transportation expenses by product is shown below. 

Production Taxes  . Production taxes were   $54 million   in the Current Period compared to   $87 million   in the Prior Period. On a unit-of-production basis, production taxes were   $0.30   per boe in the Current Period compared to   $0.47   per boe in the Prior Period. In general, production taxes are calculated using value-based formulas that produce lower per unit costs when oil, natural gas and NGL prices are lower. The absolute and per unit   decrease   in production taxes in the Current Period was primarily due to lower prices received for oil, natural gas and NGL. Production taxes in the Current Period and the Prior Period included approximately $3 million and $4 million, respectively, or $0.02 per boe, associated with VPP production volumes. 
  General and Administrative Expenses  . General and administrative expenses were   $172 million   in the Current Period and   $174 million   in the Prior Period, or   $0.96   and   $0.93   per boe, respectively. The expense decrease in the Current Period was primarily due to reduced overhead as a result of our workforce reduction in the 2015 third quarter and our continuing efforts to reduce other administrative expenses. The reduction was offset by less overhead billed to our partners resulting from certain divestitures in 2015 and 2016. In addition, in the Current Period, we recorded positive fair value adjustments to PSUs granted to executives of the Company, which were primarily the result of an increase in the trading price of our common stock.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with oil and natural gas property acquisition, drilling and completion activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with the acquisition of leasehold, as well as drilling and completion activities, and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $110 million and $156 million of internal costs in the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively, directly related to our leasehold acquisition and drilling and completion efforts. 
  Restructuring and Other Termination Costs.   We recorded   $3 million   and   $39 million   in the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively, for restructuring and other termination costs. The Current Period amount was primarily related to the reduction in workforce in connection with the restructuring of our compressor manufacturing subsidiary. In the Prior Period, we reduced our workforce by approximately 15% as part of an overall plan to reduce costs and better align our workforce with the needs of our business and current oil and natural gas commodity prices. In connection with the reduction, we incurred a total charge of approximately $55 million for one-time termination benefits, all of which were paid in cash in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, the Prior Quarter included negative fair value adjustments to PSUs granted to former executives of the Company, which were primarily the result of a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. 
  Provision for Legal Contingencies.   In the Current Period and the Prior Period, we recorded   $112 million   and   $359 million  , respectively, for legal contingencies. The Current Period provision consists of accruals for loss contingencies primarily related to royalty claims. See Note 4 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion of royalty claims. The Prior Period amount includes $25 million related to the resolution in April 2015 of litigation we were defending against the state of Michigan and   $339 million   related to litigation involving our early redemption of our 2019 notes, partially offset by $5 million related to certain royalty claimants that opted out of a settlement agreement. 
  Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization  . Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) of oil, natural gas and NGL properties was   $791 million   and   $1.773 billion   in the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively. The average DD A rate per boe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was   $4.40   and   $9.48   in the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively. The absolute and per unit   decrease   in the Current Period was the result of a lower amortization base, which is due to the 2015 and 2016 impairments of our oil and natural gas properties. 
  Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets  . Depreciation and amortization of other assets was   $83 million   in the Current Period compared to   $100 million   in the Prior Period. On a unit-of-production basis, depreciation and amortization of other assets was   $0.46   per boe in the Current Period compared to   $0.53   per boe in the Prior Period. Property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows depreciation expense by asset class for the Current Period and the Prior Period and the estimated useful lives of these assets.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties.   Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to quarterly full cost ceiling tests. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. For the Current Period and the Prior Period, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling, resulting in impairments of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties of   $2.331 billion   and   $15.407 billion  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the present value of estimated future net revenue of our proved reserves, discounted at an annual rate of 10%, was $3.819 billion. Estimated future net revenue represents the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production, gathering, processing, transportation and future development costs, using prices and costs under existing economic conditions as of that date. The prices used in the present value calculation as of   September 30, 2016   were $41.68 per bbl of oil and $2.28 per mcf of natural gas, before price differential adjustments.  
  Impairments of Fixed Assets and Other.   In the Current Period and the Prior Period, we recognized   $795 million   and   $167 million  , respectively, of fixed asset impairment losses and other charges. On October 31, 2016, we conveyed our interests in the Barnett Shale operating area located in north central Texas and simultaneously terminated most of our future commitments associated with this asset. In connection with this transaction, we accrued   $334 million   of charges in the Current Period related to the termination of a natural gas gathering agreement associated with the Barnett Shale assets. Certain of our other property and equipment, including buildings, surface land, compressors and office equipment, qualified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . We have recognized an impairment charge of   $282 million   in the Current Period related to these assets representing the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets, less the anticipated costs to sell. Also in the Current Period, we have entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the majority of our upstream and midstream assets in the Devonian Shale located in West Virginia and Kentucky. Additionally, certain of our other property and equipment, including gathering systems, natural gas compressors and buildings and land, qualified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016. We have recognized an impairment charge of   $134 million   in the Current Period for these assets for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets, less the anticipated costs to sell. The Prior Period amount consisted of a $70 million settlement charge for a net acreage maintenance obligation to Total S.A. in our Barnett Shale joint venture, a $47 million loss contingency related to contract disputes, a $21 million impairment related to the sale of third-party rental compressors, a $22 million impairment of a note receivable and $7 million of charges incurred for terminating drilling contracts as a result of the decline in oil and natural gas prices.  
  Net (Gains) Losses on Sales of Fixed Assets.   In the Current Period,   net gains   on sales of fixed assets were   $5 million   compared to   net losses   of   $3 million   in the Prior Period. The Current Period and the Prior Period amounts primarily related to the sale of gathering systems, buildings, land and other property and equipment.

Interest Expense  . Interest expense was   $197 million   in the Current Period compared to   $210 million   in the Prior Period as follows: 

___________________________________________ 
           (a) 
    Includes settlements related to the interest accrual for the current period and the effect of (gains) losses on early-terminated trades. Settlements of early-terminated trades are reflected in realized (gains) losses over the original life of the hedged item. 
              (b) 
    Includes changes in the fair value of open interest rate derivatives offset by amounts reclassified to realized (gains) losses during the current period. 
     The decrease in capitalized interest resulted from a lower average balance of unproved oil and natural gas properties, the primary asset on which interest is capitalized. The decrease in senior note interest expense is primarily due to $124 million of interest on our second lien notes being accounted for as a reduction in the carrying value of debt instead of interest expense as a result of troubled debt restructuring accounting rules. Interest expense, excluding unrealized gains or losses on interest rate derivatives and net of amounts capitalized, was   $1.06 per boe   in the Current Period and   $1.17 per boe   in the Prior Period. 
  Losses on Investments.     Losses   on investments of   $3 million   in the Current Period were primarily related to our equity investment in Sundrop Fuels, Inc.   Losses   on investments of    $57 million   in the Prior Period were primarily related to our equity investments in FTS International, Inc. and Sundrop Fuels, Inc. 
  Loss on Sale of Investment  . In the Current Period, we sold certain of our mineral interests and assigned our partnership interest in Mineral Acquisition Company I, L.P. to KKR Royalty Aggregator LLC. As a result of the transaction, we wrote off our equity investment and recognized a   $10 million     loss  .  
  Gains   on Purchases or Exchanges of Debt  . In the Current Period, we used the proceeds from our term loan facility discussed above to purchase and retire   $898 million   principal amount of our senior notes and   $708 million   principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes for an aggregate   $1.5 billion   pursuant to tender offers, resulting in a gain of $87 million. Also, in the Current Period, we repurchased in the open market approximately   $181 million   principal amount of our senior notes for   $151 million   and   $118 million   principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes for   $63 million  . Additionally, in the Current Period, we privately negotiated exchanges of approximately   $290 million   principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for   53,923,925   shares of our common stock and   $287 million   principal amount of our outstanding contingent convertible senior notes for   55,427,782   shares of our common stock, resulting in a gain of $168 million. 
  Other Income  . Other income was   $13 million   in the Current Period and consisted of $2 million of interest income and $11 million of miscellaneous income. In the Prior Period, other income was   $3 million   and consisted of $5 million of interest income and $2 million of miscellaneous expense.

Income Tax Benefit.   Chesapeake recorded an income tax   benefit   of   $3.814 billion   in the Prior Period. Our effective income tax rate was 0.0% in the Current Period and 23.5% in the Prior Period. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from the Prior Period to the Current Period is primarily due to the tax benefit at expected rates being fully offset by a valuation allowance. Further, our effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences. See Note 12 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for a discussion of income tax expenses. 
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.   Chesapeake recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of   $1 million   and   $50 million   in the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively. The Current Period amount was attributable to the Trust. The Prior Period amount was primarily related to dividends paid on preferred stock of our CHK C-T subsidiary. The decrease from the Prior Period to the Current Period is due to the repurchase of all of the preferred shares of CHK C-T from third-party shareholders in August 2015.

ITEM 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Derivatives 
  Our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil, natural gas and NGL. To mitigate a portion of our exposure to adverse price changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices to be received for our share of production. We believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives. 
  Our general strategy for protecting short-term cash flow and attempting to mitigate exposure to adverse oil, natural gas and NGL price changes is to hedge into strengthening oil and natural gas futures markets when prices reach levels that management believes are unsustainable for the long term, have material downside risk in the short term or provide reasonable rates of return on our invested capital. Information we consider in forming an opinion about future prices includes general economic conditions, industrial output levels and expectations, producer breakeven cost structures, liquefied natural gas trends, oil and natural gas storage inventory levels, industry decline rates for base production and weather trends. 
  We use derivative instruments to achieve our risk management objectives, including swaps and options. All of these are described in more detail below. We typically use swaps for a large portion of the oil and natural gas price risk we hedge. We have also sold calls, taking advantage of premiums associated with market price volatility. In 2012 and 2013, we bought oil and natural gas calls to, in effect, lock in sold call positions. Due to lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, we were able to achieve this at a low cost to us. In some cases, we deferred the payment of the premium on these trades to the related month of production. 
  We determine the volume potentially subject to derivative contracts by reviewing our overall estimated future production levels, which are derived from extensive examination of existing producing reserve estimates and estimates of likely production from new drilling. Production forecasts are updated at least monthly and adjusted if necessary to actual results and activity levels. We do not enter into derivative contracts for volumes in excess of our share of forecasted production, and if production estimates were lowered for future periods and derivative instruments are already executed for some volume above the new production forecasts, the positions would be reversed. The actual fixed price on our derivative instruments is derived from the reference NYMEX price, as reflected in current NYMEX trading. The pricing dates of our derivative contracts follow NYMEX futures. All of our commodity derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed price as stated in the contract and the floating-price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. 
  We review our derivative positions continuously and if future market conditions change and prices are at levels we believe could jeopardize the effectiveness of a position, we will mitigate this risk by either negotiating a cash settlement with our counterparty, restructuring the position or entering into a new trade that effectively reverses the current position. The factors we consider in closing or restructuring a position before the settlement date are identical to those we review when deciding to enter into the original derivative position. Gains or losses related to closed positions will be recognized in the month of related production based on the terms specified in the original contract. 
  We have determined the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices, volatility curves and discount factors. These estimates are compared to counterparty valuations for reasonableness. Derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations. This non-performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments, but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives. Future risk related to counterparties not being able to meet their obligations has been partially mitigated under our commodity hedging arrangements which require counterparties to post collateral if their obligations to Chesapeake are in excess of defined thresholds. The values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions and other factors. See Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this report for further discussion of the fair value measurements associated with our derivatives.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

As of   September 30, 2016  , our oil and natural gas derivative instruments consisted of the following: 
             
    Swaps  : Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price to the counterparty for the hedged commodity. In exchange for higher fixed prices on certain of our swap trades, we granted options that allow the counterparty to double the notional amount. 
                
    Options  : Chesapeake sells, and occasionally buys, call options in exchange for a premium. At the time of settlement, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, Chesapeake pays the counterparty the excess on sold call options, and Chesapeake receives the excess on bought call options. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call options, no payment is due from either party.  
                
    Collars  : These instruments contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, Chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price. If the market price is between the put and the call strike prices, no payments are due from either party.  
                
    Basis Protection Swaps  : These instruments are arrangements that guarantee a fixed price differential to NYMEX from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives the fixed price differential and pays the floating market price differential to the counterparty for the hedged commodity. 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the following open oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instruments:

    Certain hedging arrangements include a sold option to double the volume at an average price of $53.67/bbl covering 0.7 mmbbls, which are included in the sold call options. 
              (b) 
    Certain hedging arrangements include a sold option to double the volume at an average price of $2.80/mmbtu covering 26 tbtus, which are included in the sold call options.

    Included in the fair value are deferred premiums of $20 million which will be included in oil, natural gas and NGL sales as realized gains (losses) in the remainder of 2016. 
     In addition to the open derivative positions disclosed above, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2 million   of net derivative gains related to settled contracts for future production periods that will be recorded within oil, natural gas and NGL sales as realized gains (losses) on derivatives once they are transferred from either accumulated other comprehensive income or unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives in the month of related production, based on the terms specified in the original contract as noted below.    

The table below reconciles the changes in fair value of our oil and natural gas derivatives during the Current Period. Of the   $121 million   fair value liability as of   September 30, 2016  , a $104 million liability relates to contracts maturing in the next 12 months and a $17 million liability relates to contracts maturing after 12 months. All open derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016   are expected to mature by December 31, 2022. 

The change in oil and natural gas prices during the Current Period decreased the liability related to our derivative instruments by   $111 million  . This unrealized loss is recorded in oil, natural gas and NGL sales. We settled contracts in the Current Period that were in an asset position for   $282 million  . We terminated contracts that were in a liability position for   $5 million  . Realized gains and losses will be recorded in oil, natural gas and NGL sales in the month of related production.

Interest Rate Derivatives 
  The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates, using the earliest demand repurchase date for contingent convertible senior notes. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had total debt of   $8.717 billion  , including   $6.473 billion   of fixed rate debt at interest rates averaging   6.69%   and   $2.244 billion   of floating rate debt at an interest rate of   6.88%  . 

___________________________________________ 
           (a) 
    This amount does not include the premium and deferred financing costs included in debt of $954 million and interest rate derivatives of   $6 million  . 
     Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our floating rate senior notes. All of our other indebtedness is fixed rate and, therefore, does not expose us to the risk of fluctuations in earnings or cash flow due to changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. 
  From time to time, we enter into interest rate derivatives, including fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps (we receive a fixed interest rate and pay a floating market rate) to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of our senior notes and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps (we receive a floating market rate and pay a fixed interest rate) to manage our interest rate exposure related to our revolving credit facility borrowings. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   interest rate derivatives outstanding. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $31 million of net gains related to settled derivative contracts that will be recorded within interest expense as realized gains or losses once they are transferred from our senior note liability or within interest expense as unrealized gains or losses over the remaining seven-year term of our related senior notes. 
  Realized and unrealized (gains) or losses from interest rate derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  Foreign Currency Derivatives 
  In December 2006, we issued  600 million of 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017. Concurrent with the issuance of the euro-denominated senior notes, we entered into cross currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the senior notes. In May 2011, we purchased and subsequently retired  256 million in aggregate principal amount of these senior notes following a tender offer, and we simultaneously unwound the cross currency swaps for the same principal amount.   In the Current Quarter, in connection with our tender offers, we retired    36 million   in aggregate principal amount of our   6.25%   Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017, and we simultaneously unwound the cross currency swaps for the same principal amount at a cost of   $8 million  . Under the terms of the remaining cross currency swaps, on each semi-annual interest payment date, the counterparties pay us    8 million   and we pay the counterparties   $13 million  , which yields an annual dollar-equivalent interest rate of   7.491%  . Upon maturity of the notes, the counterparties will pay us    266 million   and we will pay the counterparties   $355 million  . The terms of the cross currency swaps were based on the dollar/euro exchange rate on the issuance date of $1.3325 to  1.00. Through the cross currency swaps, we have eliminated any potential variability in our expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates and therefore the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The fair values of the cross currency swaps are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as liabilities of   $56 million   and   $52 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. The euro-denominated debt in long-term debt has been adjusted to   $299 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , using an exchange rate of   $1.1235   to  1.00.

Supply Contract Derivatives 
  As discussed in Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report, we enter into supply contracts in the normal course of business under which we commit to deliver a predetermined quantity of natural gas to certain counterparties in an attempt to earn attractive margins. Under certain contracts, we receive a sales price that is based on the price of a product other than natural gas thereby creating an embedded derivative. The prices of the products other than natural gas are unobservable. We engage an independent third-party valuation firm to value these supply contracts. The products being valued other than natural gas are sensitive to pricing fluctuations and some of these fluctuations could be material. Changes to the value of these contracts are recorded as mark-to-market adjustments to marketing, gathering and compression revenues in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
           ITEM 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Chesapeake s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(b). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , which materially affected, or was reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
   
           ITEM 1.  
    Legal Proceedings 
     Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings  
  The Company is involved in a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings (including those described below). Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of them seek or may seek damages and penalties, the amount of which is currently indeterminate. See Note 4 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for information regarding our estimation and provision for potential losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings. 
  2016 Shareholder Litigation  . On April 19, 2016, a derivative action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the Company and current and former directors and officers of the Company alleging, among other things, violation of and conspiracy to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, gross mismanagement and violations of Sections 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act related to actions allegedly taken by such persons since 2008. The lawsuit seeks certification as a class action, damages, attorneys  fees and other costs. 
  Regulatory and Related Proceedings.   The Company has received, from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain state governmental agencies and authorities, subpoenas and demands for documents, information and testimony in connection with investigations into possible violations of federal and state antitrust laws relating to our purchase and lease of oil and natural gas rights in various states. The Company also has received DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state subpoenas seeking information on the Company s royalty payment practices. Chesapeake has engaged in discussions with the DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state agency representatives and continues to respond to such subpoenas and demands. 
  In addition, the Company received a DOJ subpoena and a voluntary document request from the SEC seeking information on our accounting methodology for the acquisition and classification of oil and natural gas properties and related matters. Chesapeake has engaged in discussions with the DOJ and SEC about these matters. On October 4, 2016, a securities class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the Company and certain current directors and officers of the Company alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities laws for purported misstatements in the Company s SEC filings and other public disclosures regarding the Company s accounting for the acquisition and classification of oil and natural gas properties. The lawsuit seeks certification as a class action, damages, attorneys  fees and other costs. 
  Redemption of 2019 Notes.   See Note 4 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for a description of pending litigation regarding our redemption in May 2013 of our 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes). 
  Business Operations.   Chesapeake is involved in various other lawsuits and disputes incidental to its business operations, including commercial disputes, personal injury claims, royalty claims, property damage claims and contract actions. With regard to contract actions, various mineral or leasehold owners have filed lawsuits against us seeking specific performance to require us to acquire their oil and natural gas interests and pay acreage bonus payments, damages based on breach of contract and/or, in certain cases, punitive damages based on alleged fraud. The Company has successfully defended a number of these failure-to-close cases in various courts, has settled and resolved other such cases and disputes and believes that its remaining loss exposure for these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Regarding royalty claims, Chesapeake and other natural gas producers have been named in various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayment. The suits against us allege, among other things, that we used below-market prices, made improper deductions, used improper measurement techniques and/or entered into arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with the production and sale of natural gas and NGL. The Company has resolved a number of these claims through negotiated settlements of past and future royalties and has prevailed in various other lawsuits. We are currently defending lawsuits seeking damages with respect to royalty underpayment in various states, including, but not limited to, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Louisiana and Arkansas. These lawsuits include cases filed by individual royalty owners and putative class actions, some of which seek to certify a statewide class. The Company also has received DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state subpoenas seeking information on the Company s royalty payment practices.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

Chesapeake is defending numerous lawsuits filed by individual royalty owners alleging royalty underpayment with respect to properties in Texas. On April 8, 2015, Chesapeake obtained a transfer order to move a substantial portion of these lawsuits to the 348th District Court of Tarrant County for pre-trial purposes (MDL). These lawsuits, which primarily relate to the Barnett Shale, generally allege that Chesapeake underpaid royalties by making improper deductions and using incorrect production volumes. Chesapeake has entered into a settlement agreement with MDL plaintiffs representing over 97% of the hydrocarbons at issue by volume and, on July 22, 2016, the plaintiffs who accepted the settlement filed to dismiss such lawsuits. Chesapeake funded the settlement amount of approximately $29 million in cash. Chesapeake also signed a $10 million, three-year promissory note in July 2016, which is accrued for as of September 30, 2016. Additional plaintiffs are continuing to accept the settlement on a rolling basis. Chesapeake expects that additional lawsuits filed by plaintiffs not participating in the settlement will continue to be pursued and that new plaintiffs will file other lawsuits making similar allegations. 
  On December 9, 2015, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by the Office of Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in the Bradford County Court of Common Pleas related to royalty underpayment and lease acquisition and accounting practices with respect to properties in Pennsylvania. The lawsuit, which primarily relates to the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, alleges that Chesapeake violated the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL) by making improper deductions and entering into arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties. The lawsuit seeks statutory restitution, civil penalties and costs, as well as temporary injunction from exploration and drilling activities in Pennsylvania until restitution, penalties and costs have been paid and permanent injunction from further violations of the UTPCPL. On February 8, 2016, the Office of Attorney General amended the complaint to, among other things, add an additional UTPCPL claim and antitrust claim alleging that a joint exploration agreement to which Chesapeake is a party established unlawful market allocation for the acquisition of leases. In response to Chesapeake s preliminary objections, the Office of Attorney General filed a second amended complaint on May 3, 2016, alleging further violations of the UTPCPL based upon alleged predicate violations of the federal Sherman Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Chesapeake removed the case to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on May 27, 2016. On August 15, 2016, the federal court remanded the case to state court. 
  Putative statewide class actions in Pennsylvania and Ohio and purported class arbitrations in Pennsylvania have been filed on behalf of royalty owners asserting various claims for damages related to alleged underpayment of royalties as a result of the Company s divestiture of substantially all of its midstream business and most of its gathering assets in 2012 and 2013. These cases include claims for violation of and conspiracy to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and for an unlawful market allocation agreement for mineral rights. One of the cases includes claims of intentional interference with contractual relations and violations of antitrust laws related to purported markets for gas mineral rights, operating rights and gas gathering sources. 
  The Company is also defending lawsuits alleging various violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act and state antitrust laws. In 2016, putative class action lawsuits have been filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and in Oklahoma state courts, and an individual lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court of Kansas, in each case against the Company and other defendants. The lawsuits generally allege that, since 2007 and continuing through April 2013, the defendants conspired to rig bids and depress the market for the purchases of oil and natural gas leasehold interests and properties in the Anadarko Basin containing producing oil and natural gas wells. The lawsuits seek damages, attorney s fees, costs and interest, as well as enjoinment from adopting practices or plans which would restrain competition in a similar manner as alleged in the lawsuits.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS  

In April 2016, a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of the Company s 6.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the Company s December 2015 debt exchange, whereby the Company privately exchanged newly issued 8.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 (Second Lien Notes) for certain outstanding senior unsecured notes and contingent convertible notes. The lawsuit alleges that the Company violated the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by benefiting themselves and a minority of noteholders who are qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). According to the lawsuit, as a result of the Company s private debt exchange in which only QIBs (and non-U.S. persons under Regulation S) were eligible to participate, the Company unjustly enriched itself at the expense of class members by reducing indebtedness and reducing the value of the 2020 Notes and the 2022 Notes. The lawsuit seeks damages and attorney s fees, in addition to declaratory relief that the debt exchange and the liens created for the benefit of the Second Lien Notes are null and void and that the debt exchange effectively resulted in a default under the indentures for the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes. In June 2016, the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, and in October 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. A hearing date for the motion has not been set. 
  Environmental Proceedings 
  Our subsidiary Chesapeake Appalachia, LLC (CALLC) is engaged in discussions with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) regarding potential violations of the permitting requirements of the federal Clean Water Act, the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law and the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and Encroachments Act in connection with the placement of dredge and fill material during construction of certain sites in Pennsylvania. CALLC identified the potential violations in connection with an internal review of its facilities siting and construction processes and voluntarily reported them to the regulatory agencies. Resolution of the matter may result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000. 
  CALLC and the PADEP are also engaged in discussions regarding alleged violations of the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Act and the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law in connection with contamination in the vicinity of one of CALLC s well pads in Sullivan County, Pennsylvania. Resolution of the matter may result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000. 
  On February 16, 2016, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit brought in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma by the Sierra Club. The complaint alleges that we and the other defendants, all exploration and production companies, have violated the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act by operating produced water disposal wells in a manner that has caused earthquakes. It requests a court order requiring substantial reduction of the amounts of produced water disposed of in such manner, the creation of an earthquake prediction center, and the reinforcement of purportedly vulnerable structures that could be impacted by earthquakes. 
  On October 14, 2016, we were named as a defendant in a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, alleging that we and the other defendants have operated produced water disposal wells in a manner that has caused earthquakes. The proposed class would consist of property owners in a twenty-five county area of Oklahoma. The petition seeks, among other relief, reimbursement of insurance premiums and an award of damages for injury to real property. 
   
           ITEM 1A.  
    Risk Factors 
     Our business has many risks. Factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our common stock, preferred stock or senior notes are described under  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of our 2015 Form 10-K. This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the SEC.

    Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
     In January 2016, our Board of Directors determined to suspend dividend payments on our preferred stock. Suspension of the dividends did not constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility or bond indentures. However, as a result of such suspension, we are in arrears in the payment of dividends with respect to our 5.75% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, 5.75% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (series A), 5.00% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (series 2005B) and 4.50% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.
