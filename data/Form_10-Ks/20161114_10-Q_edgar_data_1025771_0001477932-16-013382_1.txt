     Table of Contents           CHASE PACKAGING CORPORATION     NOTES TO INTERIM CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    September 30  , 2016    (Unaudited)       NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION:       Chase Packaging Corporation ( the Company ), a Texas Corporation, previously manufactured woven paper mesh for industrial applications, polypropylene mesh fabric bags for agricultural use, and distributed agricultural packaging manufactured by other companies. Management s plans for the Company include securing a suitable merger partner wishing to go public or acquiring private companies to create investment value for the Company. However, no assurance can be given that management will be successful in its efforts. The failure to achieve these plans will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and ability to continue as a going concern.     The interim condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to provide for fair presentation and a reasonable understanding of the information presented. The Interim Condensed Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes, as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, previously filed with the SEC.     In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of financial position as of September 30, 2016, results of operations for the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been made. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.     The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Note 3 to the Company s financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which is incorporated herein by reference. Specific reference is made to that report for a description of the Company s securities and the notes to financial statements.      NOTE   2   -   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:       In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.  This ASU provides more explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the financial statements.     In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Topic 205-40) , which requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new standard will be effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the financial statements.                 6       
     Table of Contents           NOTE   3   -   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:         Use of Estimates:       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents balances with high credit quality financial institutions. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents held in financial institutions that were uninsured by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the amount of $897,098 and $973,470 respectively.        Income Taxes       The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured assuming enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such asset will be realized.     The Company adopted FASB Interpretation of  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . There was no impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of implementing this guidance. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company evaluated its tax positions and did not have any unrecognized tax benefits. The Company s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.      NOTE   4   - BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE:      Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the sum of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the dilutive effect of shares issuable through the exercise of common stock equivalents.     We have excluded 37,424,000 and 34,675,000 common stock equivalents (preferred stock, warrants and stock options) from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, which, if included, would have an antidilutive effect.                 7       
     Table of Contents          NOTE   5   - INCOME TAXES:      No current provision for Federal income taxes was required for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, due to the Company s operating losses. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company had unused net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $1,135,000 and $1,043,000 which expire at various dates through 2036. Most of this amount is subject to annual limitations under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code related to  changes in ownership.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the deferred tax assets related to the aforementioned carry-forwards have been fully offset by valuation allowances, since it is more likely than not that significant utilization of such amounts will not occur in the foreseeable future.           We file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal and Texas state jurisdictions. Tax years for fiscal 2008 through 2016 are open and potentially subject to examination by the Texas state taxing authority.     The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress.     The following is a reconciliation of the tax derived by applying the statutory rate to the earnings before income taxes, and comparing that to the recorded income tax (expense) benefits:           The Company had no uncertain tax positions that would necessitate recording of a tax related liability.                 8       
     Table of Contents           NOTE   6   - PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERING:      On September 7, 2007, the Company completed a private placement, pursuant to which 13,334 units (the  Units ) were sold at a per Unit cash purchase price of $150, for a total subscribed amount of $2,000,100. Each Unit consists of: (1) one share of Series A 10% convertible preferred stock, par value $1.00, stated value $100 (the  Preferred Stock ); (2) 500 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.10 (the  Common Stock ); and (3) 500 warrants (the  Warrants ) exercisable into Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. The proceeds of $2,000,100 were allocated to the instruments as follows:            Warrants      2014 Extension of Warrant Terms     On August 31, 2014, 6,909,000 common share purchase warrants issued by the Company were modified to extend their maturity date to September 7, 2015. The exercise price and all other terms of the original warrant agreement remained the same. The warrants modification expense of $23,963 was computed as the incremental value of the modified warrants over the unmodified warrants on the modification date using a per share price of $0.15 per share, which was the contemporaneous private placement offering price. Assumptions used in the Black Scholes option-pricing model for these warrants were as follows:           2015 Extension of Warrant Terms     On August 31, 2015, 6,909,000 common share purchase warrants issued by the Company were modified to extend their maturity date to September 7, 2017. The exercise price and all other terms of the original warrant agreement remain the same. The warrants modification expense of $14,684 was computed as the incremental value of the modified warrants over the unmodified warrants on the modification date using a per share price of $0.15 per share, which was the contemporaneous private placement offering price. Assumptions used in the Black Scholes option-pricing model for these warrants were as follows:                        9       
     Table of Contents         As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, warrants to purchase 6,909,000 shares were outstanding, having exercise prices at $0.15 and an expiration date of September 7, 2017.           As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the average remaining contractual life of the outstanding warrants was 0.94 year and 1.69 years, respectively. The Warrants expire on September 7, 2017.      Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock      The principal terms of the Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock were as follows:      Voting rights    The Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock has voting rights (one vote per share) equal to those of the Company s common stock.      Dividend rights    The Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock carries a fixed cumulative dividend, as and when declared by our Board of Directors, of 10% per annum, accrued daily, compounded annually and payable in cash upon a liquidation event for up to five years, as well as the right to receive any dividends paid to holders of common stock.      Conversion rights    The holders of the Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock have the right to convert any or all of their Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock, at the option of the holder, at any time, into common stock on a one for one thousand basis.       Redemption rights   The shares of the Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock may be redeemed by the Company, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, upon written notice by the Company to the holders of Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock at any time in the event that the Preferred Stock of one or more holders has not been previously converted. The Company shall redeem each share of Preferred Stock of such holders within thirty (30) days of the Company's delivery of notice to such holders and such holders shall surrender the certificate(s) representing such shares of Preferred Stock.             Liquidation entitlement    In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of common stock, an amount equal to $100 per share of Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends.     At any time on or after August 2, 2011, the Holders of 66 2/3% or more of the Preferred Stock then outstanding could have requested liquidation of their Preferred Stock. In the event that, at the time of such requested liquidation, the Company's cash funds (in excess of a $50,000 reserve fund) then available to effect such requested liquidation were inadequate for such purpose, then such requested liquidation should have taken place (on a ratable basis) only to the extent such excess cash funds were available for such purpose.      Other provisions    There will be proportional adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like.     Effective June 30, 2012, the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock agreed to an amendment to the Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock which deleted the liquidation provisions. As a result, the Convertible Preferred Stock has been classified as equity (rather than temporary equity) in all filings beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2012.      NOTE   7   - DIVIDENDS:      On October 30, 2015, the Board of Directors declared a ten percent stock dividend on its outstanding Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock for shareholders of record as of November 15, 2015, and such shareholders received the stock dividend for each share of Series A Preferred Stock owned on that date, payable December 1, 2015. As of November 15, 2015, the Company had 27,466 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding; the total dividend paid consisted of 2,749 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (which are convertible into 2,749,000 shares of Common Stock) with a fair value of $274,900 and a total of 14 fractional shares which will be accumulated until whole shares can be issued. Due to the absence of Retained Earnings, the $2,749 par value of Preferred Stock dividend was charged against Additional Paid-in Capital.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had 30,215 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding after the dividend declared in November 30, 2015.      NOTE   8   - STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY:      The Company's 2008 Stock Awards Plan was approved April 9, 2008 by the Board of Directors and ratified at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on June 3, 2008. The 2008 Plan became effective April 9, 2008 and will terminate on April 8, 2018. Subject to certain adjustments, the number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to awards under the 2008 Plan is 2,000,000 shares. A maximum of 80,000 shares may be granted in any one year in any form to any one participant, of which a maximum of (i) 50,000 shares may be granted to a participant in the form of stock options and (ii) 30,000 shares may be granted to a participant in the form of Common Stock or restricted stock. The 2008 Plan will be administered by a committee of the Board of Directors. Employees, including any employee who is also a director or an officer, consultants, and outside directors of the Company are eligible to participate in the 2008 Plan.     On June 24, 2013, the Company s Board approved the granting of incentive stock options to the 4 officers and 2 outside directors under the Company s 2008 Stock Awards Plan for the purchase of 200,000 and 100,000 shares with grant date on June 25, 2013, respectively of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.03 per share on June 25, 2013.              Stock Option        The fair value of each option was estimated on June 25, 2013 (date of grant) using the following Black-Scholes assumptions:           The Company vested 50% of the optioned shares on date of granting the stock options and 50% of the optioned shares vested on June 25, 2014.      The following table summarizes all stock option activity under the plans:                 The Company recognized approximately $0 and $0 of stock based compensation costs related to stock options awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     The weighted-average grant date fair value of options outstanding at September 30, 2016 was $0.03.     As of September 30, 2016, the unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan was $0.       NOTE   9   - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:      ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure,  ( ASC 820 ) defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, not adjusted for transaction costs. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).     The Three levels are described below:     Level 1 Inputs   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that is accessible by the Company;     Level 2 Inputs   Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;     Level 3 Inputs   Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants.     There were no transfers in or out of any level during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.     Except for those assets and liabilities which are required by authoritative accounting guidance to be recorded at fair value in the Company s balance sheets, the Company has elected not to record any other assets or liabilities at fair value, as permitted by ASC 820. No events occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 which would require adjustment to the recognized balances of assets or liabilities which are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.            The Company determines fair values for its investment assets as follows:     Cash equivalents at fair value   the Company s cash equivalents, at fair value, consist of money market funds   marked to market. The Company s money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy since they are valued using quoted market prices from an exchange.     The following tables provide information on those assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively:                 NOTE 10   - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:      The Company s Board of Directors has agreed to pay the Company s Chief Financial Officer an annual salary of $17,000.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.        Forward-Looking Statements       The information in this report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Act provides a  safe harbor  for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves provided they identify these statements as forward looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results. All statements other than statements of historical fact made in this report are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. The Company s actual results may differ significantly from management s expectations as a result of many factors.       You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company, and notes thereto, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of management. The Company assumes no obligations to update any of these forward-looking statements.       Results of Operations         For the three months ended       September       30, 201      6       and 201      5         Revenue      The Company had no operations and no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and incurred operating expenses of $33,390 and $16,844 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Its only income was from interest income on its short-term investments which are classified as cash and cash equivalents.       Operating Expenses      The following table presents our total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.           Operating expenses consist mostly of payroll, professional fees and legal fees. Other general and administrative expenses are comprised of transfer agent and EDGAR filer services and other services. These expenses were directly related to the maintenance of the corporate entity and the preparation and filing of reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The decrease in legal fees was due to the 50% discount on some June invoices of legal fee. The increase in operating expenses in 2016 was mainly due to the increase in professional fees.             Other Income (Expense)      The following table presents our total Other Income (Expense )  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.            Net Loss      The Company had a net loss of $33,367 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with a net loss of $16,819 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Increases in net loss were due primarily to the abovementioned effect.      Net loss attributable to common stockholders      Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $33,367 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $16,819 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Increases in net loss attributable to common stockholders were due primarily to the abovementioned effect.     Loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $(0.00) and $(0.00) based on the weighted-average shares issued and outstanding.        For the       nine       months ended       September       30, 201      6       and 201      5         Revenue      The Company had no operations and no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and incurred operating expenses of $92,414 and $59,232 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Its only income was from interest income on its short-term investments which are classified as cash and cash equivalents.              Operating Expenses      The following table presents our total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.           Operating expenses consist mostly of payroll, professional fees and legal fees. Other general and administrative expenses are comprised of transfer agent and EDGAR filer services and other services. These expenses were directly related to the maintenance of the corporate entity and the preparation and filing of reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The increase in operating expenses in 2016 was mainly due to the increase in professional fees.      Other Income (Expense)      The following table presents our total Other Income (Expense )  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.            Net Loss      The Company had a net loss of $92,341 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with a net loss of $59,156 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Increases in net loss attributable to common stockholders were due primarily to the abovementioned effect.     Loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $(0.01) and $(0.00) based on the weighted-average shares issued and outstanding.     It is anticipated that future operating expenses will increase as the Company complies with its periodic reporting requirements and effects a business combination, although there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in effecting a business combination.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      At September 30, 2016 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $897,000 consisting mostly of money market funds and U.S. Treasury Bills. Management believes that its cash and cash equivalents are sufficient for its business activities for at least the next twelve months and for the costs of seeking an acquisition of an operating business.     The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statements quarters presented in this Report.      Cash Flow            Net cash of $(76,372) and $(68,711) were used in operations during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     Cash of $76,372 used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, consisted of a net loss of $(92,341). The cash used in working capital was $15,969 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     Cash of $68,711 used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisted of net loss of $(59,156). The cash used in working capital was ($9,555) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.     No cash flows were used or provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     No cash proceeds were used or provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.             New Accounting Pronouncements      In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.  This ASU provides more explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the financial statements.     In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Topic 205-40) , which requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new standard will be effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the financial statements.      Factors Which May Affect Future Results      Future earnings of the Company are dependent on interest rates earned on the Company s invested balances and expenses incurred. The Company expects to incur significant expenses in connection with its objective of securing a suitable partner wishing to go public or acquiring private companies to create investment value for the Company.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       Not applicable.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.      Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports, such as this report, that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.      Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.      During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, our internal control over financial reporting.
