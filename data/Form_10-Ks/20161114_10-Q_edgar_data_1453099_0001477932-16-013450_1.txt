AND SUBSIDIARY     NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015          NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES       Description of Business      Cerebain Biotech Corp. (Formerly Discount Dental Materials, Inc.) ( Cerebain Biotech ), was incorporated on December 18, 2007 under the laws of Nevada. The Company is a smaller reporting biomedical company and through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cerebain Operating, Inc. (Formerly Cerebain Biotech Corp.), the Company s business revolves around the discovery of products for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease utilizing Omentum. The Company plans to produce products that will include both a medical device solution as well as a synthetic drug solution.      Cerebain Operating, Inc. was incorporated on February 22, 2010, in the State of Nevada.      The accompanying (a) condensed balance sheet at June 30, 2016 has been derived from audited statements and (b) unaudited interim condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information on the same basis as the annual financial statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year or for any future period. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2016 included on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 27, 2016.      NOTE 2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION      The Company operates in one segment in accordance with accounting guidance Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 280,  Segment Reporting . Our Principal Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker as defined by FASB ASC Topic 280.       Going Concern       The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $15,700,000 and $11,500,000 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, and had a net loss of approximately $4,200,000 and $555,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities of approximately $200,000 and $75,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with no revenue earned since inception. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.                 - 7 -       
     Table of Contents           CEREBAIN BIOTECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY    NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015        While the Company is attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues.     The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.      NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others: useful lives and residual values of long-lived assets, the valuation of equity instruments and the valuation of warrants and options. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.      Principles of Consolidation      The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cerebain Biotech Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cerebain Operating, Inc. (collectively referred to as the  Company ). There are no material intercompany transactions.      Reclassifications      Certain reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year, which did not have any impact to consolidated net loss or stockholder s deficit amounts previously reported.                  - 8 -

AND SUBSIDIARY    NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015        Advertising Costs      Advertising costs are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred. Advertising costs charged to operations were approximately $3,000 and $35,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      Research and Development      The Company expenses the cost of research and development as incurred. Research and development costs charged to operations were approximately $70,000 and $0 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in research and development costs in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.      Debt      The Company issues debt that may have separate warrants, conversion features, or no equity-linked attributes.       Debt with warrants       In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 470-20-25, when the Company issues debt with warrants, the Company treats the warrants as a debt discount, records as a contra-liability against the debt, and amortizes the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The offset to the contra-liability is recorded as additional paid in capital in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model ( Black-Scholes ) using the stock price on the date of issuance, the risk free interest rate associated with the life of the debt, and the volatility of the stock. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The debt is treated as conventional debt.       Convertible debt       derivative treatment       When the Company issues debt with a conversion feature, the Company must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, as follows: a) one or more underlying s, typically the price of our common stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. An embedded equity-linked component that meets the definition of a derivative does not have to be separated from the host instrument if the component qualifies for the scope exception for certain contracts involving an issuer s own equity. The scope exception applies if the contract is both a) indexed to its own stock; and b) classified in stockholders  equity in its statement of financial position.     If the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, the Company estimates the fair value of the convertible debt derivative using Black-Scholes upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The convertible debt derivative is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt.                 - 9 -       
     Table of Contents           CEREBAIN BIOTECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY    NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015         Convertible debt   beneficial conversion feature       If the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative, the Company assesses whether it is a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ). A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. This typically occurs when the conversion price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued. The value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature, the difference between the conversion price and the common stock into which it is convertible, and is recorded as additional paid in capital and as a debt discount in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortizes the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the consolidated statements of operations. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the consolidated statements of operations.     If the conversion feature does not qualify for either the derivative treatment or as a BCF, the convertible debt is treated as traditional debt.       Debt Modifications and Extinguishments       When the Company modifies or extinguishes debt, it does so in accordance with ASC Topic 470-50-40, which requires modification to debt instruments to be evaluated to assess whether the modifications are considered  substantial modifications . A substantial modification of terms shall be accounted for like an extinguishment. Based on the guidance relied upon and the analysis performed, if the Company believes the embedded conversion feature has no fair value on the date of issuance (measurement date) and the embedded conversion feature has no beneficial conversion feature, the embedded conversion feature does not meet the criteria in ASC 470-50-40-10 or 470-20-25 and the issuance of the convertible note payable is considered a modification, and not an extinguishment that would require the recognition of a gain or loss. If the Company determines the change in terms meet the criteria for substantial modification under ASC 470 it will treat the modification as extinguishment and recognize a gain or loss from debt extinguishment.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments       The Company applies the provisions of accounting guidance, Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Topic ASC 825 that requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of cash, accounts payable, related party payables, and notes payable to stockholders approximated carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates.      Fair Value Measurements       FASB ASC Topic 825  Financial Instruments,  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments.     The FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement , clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.             CEREBAIN BIOTECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY    NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015       The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.                   Level 1   observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.                        Level 2   other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.).                        Level 3   significant unobservable inputs (including the Company s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).          The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared.       Concentrations, Risks, and Uncertainties       The Company is a startup company subject to the substantial business risks and uncertainties inherent to such an entity, including the potential risk of business failure.      Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share      Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, using the treasury stock method, consisting of shares that might be issued upon exercise of common stock warrants and conversion of convertible notes. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding excludes common shares equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.     Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of the following types of potentially dilutive instruments:                   Warrants,                        Convertible notes,                        Employee stock options, and                        Other equity awards, which include long-term incentive awards.                   CEREBAIN BIOTECH CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY    NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015         The FASB ASC Topic 260,   Earnings Per Share  , requires the Company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution. The additional shares included in diluted earnings per share represents the number of shares that would be issued if all of the Company s outstanding dilutive instruments were converted into common stock.     Diluted earnings per share are based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options, warrants, and convertible notes are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance, and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.     Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same since the Company had net losses for all periods presented and including the additional potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements      The Company has evaluated new accounting pronouncements that have been issued and are not yet effective for the Company and determined that there are no such pronouncements expected to have an impact on the Company s future financial statements.      NOTE 4       COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES       Employment Agreements       Eric Clemons      On June 15, 2013, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Eric Clemons. Terms of the agreement included the following:                   An annual salary of One Hundred Fifty-Six Thousand Dollars ($156,000), which has been paid or settled in stock in full.                        Bonus of $40,000 upon the delivery to the Company of a prototype medical device from Sonos Models Inc., which has been paid in full.                        Cash bonus should he be responsible for the Company consolidating with or merge into another corporation or convey all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation, will receive a cash bonus calculated using a Lehman formula of 5% for the first $1,000,000, 4% for the second $1,000,000, 3% for the third $1,000,000, 2% for the fourth $1,000,000, and 1% thereafter. To date, this incentive has not earned or been paid.                        Option to acquire up to 100,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share subject to a vesting schedule. Fair Market Value of these options totaled approximately $822,000, and is recognized ratably over the vesting period in selling, general and administrative expense. The options were valued using the Black-Scholes value option pricing model with the following inputs: volatility of 100%; risk-free interest rate of 1.04%; expected term of 5 years; and 0% dividend yield.

AND SUBSIDIARY    NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015       On March 1, 2015, the Company entered into an addendum to the employment agreement related to Mr. Clemons. The addendum had no accounting impact on the prior agreements. Terms of the addendum included a cash placement bonus equal to an amount up to 10% of the aggregate purchase price paid by each purchaser of the Company s Securities and Convertible Debt, where the purchaser of said Securities and Convertible Debt has been directly introduced to the Company by Mr. Clemons. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a cash placement bonus was earned of approximately $15,000 and $0, respectively, which was recognized as a reduction of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock and debt issuances and recorded as an expense.      NOTE   10   EARNINGS PER SHARE      FASB ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share , requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS) computations.     The total number of potential additional dilutive options and warrants outstanding was approximately 2,390,000 and 430,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, the convertible notes convert at an exercise price of between $0.20 and $5.00 per share of common stock representing approximately 7.2 million shares. The options, warrants and shares underlying the convertible note were considered for the dilutive calculation but in periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:                  CEREBAIN BIOTECH CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARY    NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015        The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for the periods ended September 30 and June 30, 2016 respectively, because it is not presently known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carryforwards.      At September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $15,700,000 in Federal and State tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized in future periods to reduce taxable income, and begin to expire in 2030. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382, the future utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future.     The Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions on tax returns that will be filed.      The Company has not filed any of its income tax returns. The fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 thru 2016 are open for examination.      NOTE 12       SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      In October 2016, convertible notes of approximately $400 have been converted to 2,000 shares of the Company s common stock. During the same period, the Company issued 2,000 shares of our common stock, pursuant to warrant agreements that were exercised, in exchange for $1,000.             ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        DISCLAIMER REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS      Certain statements in this Form 10-Q, which are not statements of historical fact, are what are known as "forward-looking statements," which are basically statements about the future. For that reason, these statements involve risk and uncertainty since no one can accurately predict the future. Words such as "plans," "intends," "hopes," "seeks," "anticipates," "expects," and the like, often identify such forward looking statements, but are not the only indication that a statement is a forward-looking statement. Such forward-looking statements include statements concerning our plans and objectives with respect to our present and future operations, and statements which express or imply that such present and future operations will or may produce revenues, income or profits. These and other factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although we base these forward-looking statements on our expectations, assumptions, and projections about future events, actual events and results may differ materially, and our expectations, assumptions, and projections may prove to be inaccurate. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this filing.       Business Overview      We were incorporated on December 18, 2007, in the State of Nevada. We are a smaller reporting biomedical company and through our wholly owned subsidiary, Cerebain Operating, Inc. ( Cerebain ), our business involves the discovery of products for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease utilizing Omentum. Under our current plan, our products will include both a medical device solution as well as a synthetic drug solution.      On January 17, 2012, the holders of a majority of our common stock entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Cerebain Operating, Inc., a Nevada corporation, under which Cerebain Operating, Inc. agreed to purchase an aggregate of 380,000 shares of our common stock from those shareholders in exchange for $296,000. These shares represented approximately 90% of our outstanding common stock at the time of the transaction (after taking into account the cancellation of 600,000 shares of our common stock by R. Douglas Barton under the Spinoff Agreement as discussed herein). The transaction closed February 9, 2012. Concurrently with the close of the transaction, we closed a transaction with the shareholders of Cerebain whereby we issued 455,680 shares of our common stock in exchange for 22,784,000 shares of Cerebain s common stock, which represented 100% of Cerebain s outstanding common stock. In addition, concurrent with these two transactions, we closed a transaction with our primary shareholder, Mr. R. Douglas Barton, whereby we sold all of our then-existing assets to Mr. Barton in exchange for Mr. Barton assuming all of our then-existing liabilities, as well as the return of 600,000 shares of our common stock. The shares were returned by Mr. Barton and were cancelled on our books on February 9, 2012.     As a result of these transactions: (i) Cerebain Operating, Inc. became our wholly-owned subsidiary, (ii) all of our officers and one of our directors resigned immediately, and we appointed one new director and retained new executive officers; and (iii) we changed our business focus from one selling disposable dental supply products at discount prices over the Internet to one focusing on researching, developing, and testing medicinal treatments utilizing Omentum under a patent Cerebain licenses from Dr. Surinder Singh Saini, MD.             On April 15, 2014, we completed the solicitation of votes of stockholders. A majority of our shareholders voted to amend our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Cerebain Biotech Corp. As a result of this action, we changed the name of our wholly-owned subsidiary to Cerebain Operating Inc. In addition, a majority of our shareholders voted to amend our Articles of Incorporation to effectuate a reverse split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10 and approved the 2014 Cerebain Biotech Corp. Omnibus Stock Grant and Option Plan. All share and per share information was retroactively adjusted at that time to reflect the reverse split of our common stock.     Our only operations are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cerebain Operating, Inc. The term  we  as used throughout this document refers to Cerebain Biotech Corp. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cerebain Operating, Inc     In accordance with our current business plan the testing, research and development of both a medical device solution as well as a synthetic drug solution are underway, and we have contracted with certain third party companies to research, develop, and test certain products that could be used to treat dementia utilizing Omentum. We have also contracted with various individuals to facilitate the introduction of the company to medical device testing organizations in overseas locations including Poland, China and Uzbekistan for the purpose of testing our medicinal treatments utilizing Omentum. Our management anticipates that we may form subsidiaries and joint ventures to develop different drugs based on the intellectual property. Although we have contracted with a firm to research, develop and test products that could be used to treat dementia utilizing Omentum, in order to fully execute on that agreement, as well as hire one or more firms to research, develop and test medicinal treatments utilizing Omentum, we will need to raise additional funds. There can be no assurance we will be successful in raising the necessary funds. There can also be no assurance that further research and development will validate and support the results of our preliminary research and studies, or that the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained or that we will be able to develop commercially viable products on the basis of our technologies.      Description of Patent License Agreement      On June 10, 2010, our subsidiary, Cerebain Operating, Inc., entered into a Patent License Agreement under which it acquired the exclusive rights to certain intellectual property related to using Omentum for treating dementia conditions. Under the agreement we paid rights fees of $50,000 to Dr. Saini, and issued Dr. Saini 825,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $6,600 (based on the fair market value on the date of grant) restricted in accordance with Rule 144. In addition, Dr. Saini has the option to participate in the sale of equity by us in the future, up to ten percent (10%) of the money raised, in exchange for the applicable number of his shares.      In addition, the Patent License agreement provides for a royalty payment of six (6) percent of the value of the net sales, as defined, generated from the sale of licensed products. The agreement also provides for yearly minimum royalty payments of $50,000 for the fourth (June 2014), fifth (June 2015), and sixth (June 2016) anniversary of the date of the agreement, and a yearly minimum royalty payment of $100,000 for each year thereafter during the term of the agreement. We have recognized costs associated with the patent rights for $137,500 in accounts payable for the patent rights and are currently in arrears and in discussions to renegotiate the terms of the agreement. The term of the agreement shall continue until the patent in the intellectual property expires, unless terminated sooner under the provisions of the agreement, as defined.      The patent will have an estimated useful life of 20 years based on the term of the patent. Amortization of the patent will begin when the patent is issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and put in use.     Legal fees pertaining to the patent are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred. Legal fees charged to operations were approximately $600 and $200 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      We recognized a patent royalty expense of approximately $25,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to $12,500 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015. The accrued payable of $175,000 pertaining to the patent royalty expense at September 30, 2016 is included in related party payables.            Overview of Dementia and Alzheimer s Disease      Dementia (taken from Latin, originally meaning "madness") is generally referred to as a serious loss and/or decline of human brain function. The areas of brain function affected by dementia include memory, attention, language, problem solving and emotion. Dementia is generally considered as a progressive and non-reversible condition. Alzheimer s disease is the most common form of dementia. Alzheimer s disease is an age-related, non-reversible brain disorder that develops over a period of years. Initially, people experience memory loss and confusion, which may be mistaken for the kinds of memory changes that are sometimes associated with normal aging. However, the symptoms of Alzheimer s disease gradually lead to behavior and personality changes, a decline in cognitive abilities such as decision making and language skills, and problems recognizing family and friends. Alzheimer s disease ultimately leads to a severe loss of mental functions. These losses are related to the worsening breakdown of the connections between certain neurons in the brain responsible for memory and learning. Neurons can t survive when they lose their connections to other neurons. As neurons die throughout the brain, the affected regions begin to atrophy, or shrink. By the final stage of Alzheimer s disease, damage is widespread and brain tissue has shrunk significantly.      Causes      Many scientists generally accept that one or more of the following mechanisms are responsible for dementia:                 1)  accumulation of toxic materials in brain cells, which leads to death of the cells;                         2)  reduction of certain biological factors (e.g. Acetylcholine or ACh) in a brain; and                         3)  loss or reduction of blood flow in the brain.          Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are the most common causes of dementia. Dementia can also be due to a stroke. In most circumstances, the changes in the brain that are causing dementia cannot be controlled or reversed.       Statistics                    Affected population worldwide          According to the Alzheimer s Association 2016 Alzheimer s Disease Facts and Figures, an estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, including approximately 200,000 individuals younger than age 65 who have younger-onset Alzheimer's. By 2050, it is estimated that up to 16 million Americans will have the disease. Almost two-thirds, 3.3 million, of American seniors living with Alzheimer's are women. By 2025, it is estimated that 20 states will see a 35 percent or greater growth in the number of people with Alzheimer s. Someone in the United States develops Alzheimer s every 66 seconds. In 2050, it is predicted that someone in the United States will develop the disease every 33 seconds.           In addition, the Alzheimer s Association stated Alzheimer s disease is the 6 th  leading cause of death in the United States and the 5 th  leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older. In 2013, over 84,000 Americans officially died from Alzheimer s; in 2016, an estimated 700,000 people will die with Alzheimer s, meaning they will die after having developed the disease. Deaths from Alzheimer increased 71 percent from 2000 to 2013, while deaths from other major diseases (including heart disease, stroke, breast and prostate cancer, and HIVAIDS) decreased. Alzheimer s is the only cause of death among the top 10 in America that cannot be prevented, cured, or even slowed.     According to the 2015 World Alzheimer Report, in 2015 about 46.8 million people had dementia worldwide. The report stated that this figure is likely to nearly double every 20 years, to nearly 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050. For 2015, they estimate over 9.9 million new cases of dementia each year worldwide, implying one new case every 3.2 seconds. The regional distribution of new dementia cases is 4.9 million (49% of the total) in Asia, 2.5 million (25%) in Europe, 1.7 million (18%) in the Americas, and 0.8 million (8%) in Africa.                    Cost         According to the Alzheimer s Association 2016 Alzheimer s Disease Facts and Figures, unpaid caregivers are primarily immediate family members, but they may be other relatives and friends. In 2015, 15.9 million family and friends provided an estimated 18.1 billion hours of unpaid care, a contribution to the nation valued at over $221.3 billion. Nearly half of care contributors cut back on their own expenses (including food, transportation and medical care) to pay for dementia-related care of a family member or friend. Care contributors are 28 percent more likely than other adults to eat less or go hungry because they cannot afford to pay for food. One in five care contributors cut back on their own doctor visits because of their care responsibilities. And, among caregivers, 74 percent report they are  somewhat  to  very  concerned about maintaining their own health since becoming a caregiver. On average care contributors lose over $15,000 in annual income as a result of reducing or quitting work to meet the demand of caregiving.     According to the 2015 World Alzheimer Report, the global cost of care for dementia will likely exceed $818 billion in 2015, or 1.09 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP). These costs include those attributed to informal care from family member or others, direct social care from professional care givers, and direct medical bills. About 70% of these costs occur in Western Europe and North America. Such costs will continue to increase dramatically as the affected population of dementia increases.                    Cost to Nation         According to the Alzheimer s Association 2016 Alzheimer s Disease Facts and Figures, Alzheimer s disease is the most expensive condition in the nation. In 2016, the direct costs to American society of caring for those with Alzheimer's will total an estimated $236 billion, with just under half of the costs borne by Medicare. Nearly one in every five Medicare dollars is spent on people with Alzheimer s and other dementias. In 2050, it is estimated it will be one in every three dollars. The average per-person Medicare spending for those with Alzheimer's and other dementias is three times higher than for those without these conditions. The average per-person Medicaid spending for seniors with Alzheimer's and other dementias is 19 times higher than average per-person Medicaid spending for all other seniors. Unless something is done, in 2050, Alzheimer s will cost over $1.1 trillion (in 2016 dollars). Costs to Medicare will increase over 365 percent to $589 billion.      Current Approaches to Treating Dementia      Currently, there is no cure for dementia. There are a number of prescription drugs that target those with Alzheimer s and dementia, however those drugs primarily relieve some of the disease mechanisms and are often used early in the course of the disease; however, their effects in long-term progression of the disease condition are still unclear. A majority of management of dementia generally focuses on providing emotional and physical support to a patient during the progression of the disease from caregivers or in facilities. While such support is important and necessary to a patient, it is irrelevant to treatment of the disease. Accordingly, an effective method of treatment which may be able to delay the progression of the disease and/or recover damaged brain cells does not presently exist and remains a great need.             Omentum and its Use in Treating Dementia       Omentum Overview      The Omentum is a layer of tissue lying over internal organs (e.g. the intestines) like a blanket. Omentum has the ability to generate biological agents that nourish nerves and help them grow. When such agents identified from the Omentum were tested, they were shown to provoke the growth of new brain cells in areas of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease. The Omentum tissue can also increase the level of Acetylcholine (ACh) whose reduction is considered as a main cause of brain cell death. Some scientists believe that the ability of the Omentum to provide this important factor (ACh) may be a key to successfully treating dementia. Additionally, the Omentum has been shown to be angiogenic (i.e. to promote new blood vessel growth) in areas of the body lacking blood flow.       Use of Omentum in Treating Dementia      Historically, doctors have utilized Omentum to treat dementia using a procedure called omental transposition. This approach involves a surgical procedure in which the Omentum is surgically lengthened into the brain through the chest, neck and behind the ear. The Omentum is then laid directly on the underlying brain. According to studies conducted by a team in the University of Nevada, School of Medicine, omental transposition not only arrested Alzheimer's disease, but also reversed it, resulting in the patient s neurologic function being improved. Despite the promising results, this surgical procedure has not been popular because it is very invasive and therefore often causes unwanted complications to a patient, especially in the elderly. Accordingly, a less invasive procedure or a pharmaceutical approach in treatment of dementia remains a significant need.      Agreement with Sonos      In an effort to develop a less invasive procedure in the treatment of dementia, on May 16, 2012, we signed an agreement with medical device product development company Sonos Models, Inc. ( Sonos ) to assess our options for a medical device solution ( Initial Feasibility Study ).     We completed the Initial Feasibility Study and, as a result of the findings, entered into an agreement with Sonos in September 2012 to build up to three medical device prototypes to be used for testing. In April 2014, we entered into an addendum to the agreement with Sonos, which included a commitment by us to pay Sonos up to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) cash, excluding stock based compensation, for research and development costs. These costs will be recognized in research and development expense as costs are incurred. To date, Sonos has been issued 325,000 restricted shares of our stock, 20,000 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and paid approximately $220,000, of which $65,000 has been incurred towards our monetary commitment.     To date, the results of the research suggest we have three options for implantable devices with a bias towards having them as non-invasive as possible. The options are comprised of two electro-stim types that have a multitude of variable test parameters that can be changed and modified externally as the testing facility conducts clinical trials on each patient. It is theorized that if a patient s response to the Omentum stimulation is successful, the clinical facility should be able to perform various tests for the purpose of setting  markers  for the patient and then perform the standardized cognitive testing for Alzheimer s patient with the intent of developing a testing matrix. It is our objective to test various methods and modalities with the aim of developing an enormous matrix of input to direct us to the best solution. Our goal is to be less invasive, as small as possible and as simple as possible to reach the broadest patient base. We intend to  Shape and Innovate History  as we visualize and create a solution for this debilitating disease.            Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital      There is very limited historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are a smaller reporting biomedical company and have not generated revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns due to increases in the cost of services. To become profitable and competitive, we must receive additional capital. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available, we may be unable to continue operations.      Overview      The following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD A ) of Cerebain includes the following sections:                         Results of Operations                             Liquidity and Capital Resources                             Capital Expenditures                             Fiscal Year End                             Going Concern                             Critical Accounting Policies                          Recent Accounting Pronouncements                             Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements                          Inflation          Results of Operations       Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        Revenue       For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not generate any revenues.             Operating expenses       Operating expenses decreased by approximately $600, or 0.2%, to approximately $488,100 in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $488,700 in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the following: increase in research and development cost; increase in compensation expense; increase in professional fees; and increase in travel and entertainment expenses, offset by decrease in marketing expense; decrease in consultant costs, including costs related to fair value of stock and warrants issued for services and amortization of compensation costs related to stock options; and decrease in patent royalty expense.     Operating expenses for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 were approximately comprised of marketing costs of $3,000, research and development costs of $70,000, patent royalty expense of $25,000, consulting services costs primarily paid through the issuance of our common stock of $212,000, compensation expense of $109,000, professional fees of $50,000, investor relations expense of $4,000, travel and entertainment costs of $10,000, and other operating expenses of $5,000.      Approximate operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were comprised of marketing costs of $35,000, $257,000 in consulting services costs, patent royalty expense of $112,000, compensation expense of $68,000, professional fees of $4,000, travel costs of $7,000, and other operating expenses of $5,000.        Other income (expenses)       Other expense increased by approximately $3,635,000, or 5497.8.7%, to approximately $3,702,000 in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $555,000 in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in accretion of recorded debt discounts related to notes payable and financing fee of $22,000 offset by the recognition of loss from extinguishment of debt of $3,656,000.       Net loss before income taxes       Net loss before income taxes for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $4,200,000 primarily due to the following increase in research and development cost; increase in compensation expense; increase in professional fees; and increase in travel and entertainment expenses; recognition of loss from extinguishment of debt; offset by decrease in marketing expense; decrease in consultant costs, including costs related to fair value of stock and warrants issued for services and amortization of compensation costs related to stock options; and decrease in patent royalty expense; decrease in accretion of recorded debt discounts related to notes payable and financing fee, compared to $555,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the following: marketing costs, consulting services costs, patent royalty expense, costs related to fair value of stock and warrants issued for services and amortization of compensation costs related to stock options, and professional fees.       Assets and Liabilities       Assets were approximately $414,000 as of September 30, 2016. Assets approximately consisted of cash of $1,600 and prepaid expense of $412,000. Liabilities were approximately $3,800,000 as of September 30, 2016. Liabilities approximately consisted of accounts payable of $769,000, related party payables of $294,000, short term related party notes payable of $114,000, current portion of convertible notes of $63,000 and convertible notes to stockholders, net of debt discount, of $2,600,000.       Stockholders  Deficit       Stockholders  deficit was approximately $3,400,000 as of September 30, 2016. Stockholder s deficit consisted primarily of deficit accumulated of approximately $15,700,000 at September 30, 2016, offset by shares issued to founders and recorded as compensation in the amount of $13,900, shares issued for fundraising totaling $1,375,000, net of issuance costs, beneficial conversion feature associated with convertible note of $5,150,000, shares issued in conversion of liabilities of $752,000, shares associated with warrants, options and issuances for services of $4,980,000 and shares issued for patent rights totaling $6,600.             Liquidity and Capital Resources         General     Overall, we had a decrease in cash flows of approximately $18,600 in the three month-period ended September 30, 2016 resulting from cash used in operating activities of approximately $199,000, offset partially by cash provided by financing activities of approximately $180,000.     The following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating and financing activities during the periods indicated:              Cash Flows from Operating Activities     For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operations was approximately $199,000 compared to net cash used in operations of approximately $75,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015. Net cash used in operations was primarily due to a net loss of approximately $4,200,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, accretion of debt discount of approximately $8,000, loss from extinguishment of debt of approximately $3,700,000, stock based compensation of approximately $109,000, amortization of prepaid consulting compensation of approximately $123,000, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $96,000.        Cash Flows from Financing Activities     Net cash flows provided by financing activities in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $180,000, compared to net cash provided of approximately $75,000 in the same period in 2015. The cash provided by financing activities was due to proceeds from convertible notes payable to stockholders of approximately $160,000 and proceeds from exercise of warrants of approximately $20,000.       Financing     We expect that our current working capital position, together with our expected future cash flows from operations will be insufficient to fund our operations in the ordinary course of business, anticipated capital expenditures, debt payment requirements and other contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks, and we will require additional funding in the future.      We have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or technologies or any other material capital expenditures. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments in products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and/or investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Due to the previous global economic crisis, we believe it may be difficult to obtain additional financing if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.            Capital Expenditures       Other Capital Expenditures      If we have the funds available, we expect to purchase approximately $30,000 of equipment in connection with the expansion of the business.       Fiscal year end      Cerebain and Cerebain Biotech each has a June 30 fiscal year end.      Going Concern      The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $15,700,000 and $11,500,000 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, and had a net loss of approximately $4,200,000 and $555,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities of approximately $200,000 and $75,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with no revenue earned since inception. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.     While we are attempting to commence operations and attempting to generate revenues, our cash position will not be significant enough to support our daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan, generate revenues, and successfully borrow money or sell our securities for cash.     The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.      Critical Accounting Policies      The Commission has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies on page 9.     The following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting us.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Measurement, estimates and assumptions are used for, but not limited to, useful lives and residual value of long-lived assets, and the valuation of equity instruments. We make these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results when ultimately realized could differ from those estimates. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumption.             Income Taxes      We account for income taxes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.      Stock Compensation      We account for employee and non-employee stock awards under ASC 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation, whereby equity instruments issued to employees for services are recorded based on the fair value of the instrument issued and those issued to nonemployees are recorded based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument, whichever is more reliably measurable.      Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments      We evaluate stock options, stock warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC 815-40,  Derivative Instruments and Hedging: Contracts in Entity s Own Equity  ( ASC 815-40 ). The result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC 815-40 are reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.     The common stock purchase warrants were not issued with the intent of effectively hedging any future cash flow, fair value of any asset, liability or any net investment in a foreign operation. The warrants do not qualify for hedge accounting, and as such, all future changes in the fair value of these warrants are recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised, expire or the related rights have been waived. These common stock purchase warrants do not trade in an active securities market. We estimate the fair value of these warrants using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.     If a conversion feature of conventional convertible debt is not accounted for as a derivative instrument and provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value, this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ). A BCF is recorded by the Company as a debt discount. The convertible debt is recorded net of the discount related to the BCF. The Company amortizes the discount to interest expense over the life of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method.       Fair Value of Financial Instruments      We follow the provisions of ASC 820. This Topic defines fair value, establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.     We use fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative financial instruments payable in shares of its common stock. This primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions and projections to determine fair value. These require our judgment.             Recent Accounting Pronouncements      We have evaluated new accounting pronouncements that have been issued and are not yet effective for us and determined that there are no such pronouncements expected to have an impact on our future financial statements.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We are a smaller reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.      Inflation      Management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations.       ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       We are a smaller reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.       ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-l5(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information that would be required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2016, and as of the date that the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was completed, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to satisfy the objectives for which they are intended.            Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting      Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-l5(f) of the Securities Exchange Act). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control   Integrated Framework ( COSO ). Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective, based on the COSO criteria, due to the following material weaknesses listed below.                   We have not performed a risk assessment and mapped our processes to control objectives.                        We have not implemented comprehensive entity-level internal controls.                        We have not implemented adequate system and manual controls.                        We do not have sufficient segregation of duties.                        We lack sufficient personnel with appropriate training and expertise in accounting principles general accepted in the United States.               Despite the material weaknesses reported above, our management believes that our financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.               PART II     OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       On July 21, 2016, we were sued in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (  Miriam Weber Miller v. Cerebain Biotech Corp. and Eric Clemons  , Civil Action No. 16-3943) by Miriam Weber Miller. Per the Complaint, the Plaintiff alleges: (i) she was hired by us to perform public relations, investor relations, corporate growth strategies, and was to be an advisor to our Chief Executive Officer, (ii) she performed services, and (iii) that she was not fully compensated for those services. The Complaint claims causes of action for breach of contract, violation of the Pennsylvania wage payment and collection law, and unjust enrichment, and seeks damages of approximately $400,000. We completely reject the Plaintiff s allegations in the Complaint and plan to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. We were served with the Complaint on August 2, 2016. On October 3, 2016, we filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint on the basis that the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Plaintiff filed a Response to our Motion to Dismiss and on October 19, 2016, we filed a Reply to the Plaintiff s Response. Currently, we are awaiting the Court s decision on our Motion to Dismiss. All dates related to the lawsuit, if any, will not be determined until the Court issues a decision on our Motion to Dismiss.      While incapable of estimation, in the opinion of the management, the individual regulatory and legal matters in which it might involve in the future are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company has accrued $150,000 in Accounts Payable for consulting compensation, but no accrual has been made for additional legal contingencies in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 as it is too early in the process to determine the outcome or potential loss.       ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS       There have been no changes to our Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 27, 2016.       ITEM 2.   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, we entered into various stock purchase agreements with a third party between July and September of 2016, under which we issued 40,000 shares of our common stock, restricted in accordance with Rule 144, in exchange for $20,000. The stock purchase agreements include piggyback registration rights. The issuances were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the investors were sophisticated and familiar with our operations at the time of the issuance of the shares.     On September 29, 2016, we issued Eric Clemons and Wesley Tate, our executive officers, options to acquire up to a total of 210,000 shares of our common stock under our 2014 Omnibus Stock Grant and Option Plan at an exercise price of $0.75 per share subject to a vesting schedule. The issuances were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the investors were sophisticated and familiar with our operations at the time of the issuance of the shares.      In August 2016, we entered into an unsecured amended and consolidated convertible promissory note with a non-affiliate stockholder for a principal amount of approximately $2,285,000. In exchange for the issuance of the promissory note, the stockholder agreed to extinguish a $2,135,112 convertible promissory note payable issued in April 2016 and paid us cash of $150,000. The amended and consolidated convertible note payable matures in August 2018, accrues interest at 5% per annum, and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of $0.40 per share, but only if such conversion would not cause the noteholder to own more than 9.9% of our outstanding common stock, and contains piggyback registration rights. The issuance of the promissory note was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the investor was sophisticated and familiar with our operations at the time of the issuance of the promissory note.        ITEM 3.   DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES       There have been no events which are required to be reported under this Item.       ITEM 4. MINING SAFETY DISCLOSURES       There have been no events which are required to be reported under this Item.       ITEM 5.   OTHER INFORMATION       There have been no events which are required to be reported under this Item.              ITEM 6.

 AMENDED AND CONSOLIDATED PROMISSORY NOTE
 
   cbbt_ex1031.htm      EXHIBIT 10.31       THIS PROMISSORY NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. NO SALE OR DISPOSITION MAY BE EFFECTED EXCEPT IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144 UNDER SAID ACT OR AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE HOLDER SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE ACT OR RECEIPT OF A NO-ACTION LETTER FROM THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.       AMENDED AND CONSOLIDATED CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE            For value received, Cerebain Biotech Corp., a Nevada corporation (the  Company ), promises to pay to Brad Vroom,an individual, or his assigns (the  Holder ) the principal sum of Two Million Two Hundred Eighty-Five Thousand One Hundred Twelve Dollars ($2,285,112). The principal hereof and any unpaid accrued interest thereon shall be due and payable on or before 5:00 p.m., Pacific Standard Time, on August 1, 2018 (the  Maturity Date ) (unless such payment date is accelerated as provided in Section 5 hereof). Payment of all amounts due hereunder shall be made at the address of the Holder provided for in Section 6 hereof. Interest shall accrue on the outstanding principal amount beginning on August 1, 2016, at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum, compounded annually based on a 365-day year and shall continue on the outstanding principal until paid in full.       1.    HISTORY OF THE NOTE  . This Note is an amendment and consolidation of the following (collectively, the  Original Notes );      a.  The Amended and Consolidated Convertible Promissory Note entered into by and between the Company and the Holder on or about April 27, 2016, for $2,135,112;     With the execution of this Note the Company and the Holder acknowledge and agree that the Original Note is void and unenforceable. With the execution of this Note, the Holder is loaning the Company an additional $150,000, which brings the total principal due under this Note to $2,285,112 when combined with the principal amount due under the Original Note. The Company and Holder hereby acknowledge that as of July 31, 2016, approximately Forty-Four Thousand Dollars ($44,000) interest has accrued on the Original Note and is owed to the Holder.       2.    PREPAYMENT  . The Company may at any time, upon thirty (30) days written notice (each a  Prepayment Notice ), prepay all or any part of the principal balance of this Note, provided that concurrently with each such prepayment the Company shall pay accrued interest on the principal, if any, prepaid to the date of such prepayment. Any Prepayment Notice must contain the amount of principal and interest to be prepaid by the Company. The end of the thirty-day period following a Prepayment Notice shall be referred to as a  Prepayment Date.  In the event that the Company sends a Prepayment Notice to Holder, Holder may elect prior to the Prepayment Date to convert into common stock of the Company pursuant to Section 3 hereof, all or part of the amount of principal and interest to be repaid under the Prepayment Notice instead of receiving such prepayment.      3.    CONVERSION  . The Holder of this Note is en-titled, at its option and subject to the other terms set forth herein, at any time beginning on the date hereof, and in whole or in part, to convert the outstanding principal amount of this Note, or any portion of the principal amount hereof, --and any accrued interest, into shares of the com-mon stock of the Company. Any amounts the Holder elects to convert will be converted into common stock at a rate of  $0.40 per share . Any conversion shall be effectuated by giving a written notice ( Notice of Conversion ) to the Company on the date of conversion, stating therein the amount of principal and accrued interest due to Holder under this Note being converted.             Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holder may not convert any outstanding amounts due under this Note if at the time of such conversion the amount of common stock issued for the conversion, when added to other shares of Company common stock owned by the Holder or which can be acquired by Holder upon exercise or conversion of any other instrument, would cause the Holder to own more than nine and nine-tenths percent (9.9%) of the Company s outstanding common stock. The restriction described in this paragraph may be revoked upon sixty-one (61) days prior notice from Holder to the Company.       4.    CONVERSION PRICE ADJUSTMENTS  . In the event the Company should at any time after the date hereof do either of the following: i) fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding common stock of the Company, or ii) grant the holders of the Company s common stock a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of common stock or other securities or rights convertible into additional shares of common stock without the payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of common stock (a  Stock Adjustment ), then, as of the record date (or the date of the Stock Adjustment if no record date is fixed), the conversion price of this Note shall be appropriately adjusted so that the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is adjusted in proportion to such change in the number of outstanding shares in order to insure such Stock Adjustment does not decrease the conversion value of this Note.       5.
