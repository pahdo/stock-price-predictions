NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

Organization and Business Activity   

Panther Biotechnology, Inc. (the  Company )
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 11, 2011.  The Company was originally incorporated as New Era Filing Services
Inc., changed its name to NEF Enterprises, Inc. on October 4, 2011 and then changed its name to Panther Biotechnology, Inc. on
May 29, 2014.  The Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, PubCo Reporting Services, Inc., formerly known as New Era
Filing Services, Inc., in Florida on November 20, 2012. 

The Company has established a fiscal year
end of May 31. 

The Company is an early stage bio-medical
technology company that pursues and is continuing to pursue in-licensing of certain technologies so that they may be able to develop
those technologies for treatments of patients with cancer.  Panther s current purpose is to better serve the unmet medical
needs of patients with the most difficult to treat cancers.  Panther s mission is to identify, license and acquire unique
molecules that are designed to heal without causing harm and are either optimized derivatives of existing products, repurposed
approved products or new classes of drugs. Panther is also seeking other diversified business opportunities. 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements   

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). and should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's latest annual report filed with
the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a
fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.
The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes
to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the
audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2016, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted. 

Basis of Consolidation   

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in these consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company s periodic
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties
and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the Company. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with original maturities of less than three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which,
in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value, to be cash equivalents. 

Intangible Assets   

Intangible assets are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and
take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.
All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. Intangible assets having a capitalized cost of $390,487 were impaired
during the year ended May 31, 2016. No impairment of intangible assets was identified for the three months ended August 31, 2016. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   

The Company reviews the carrying value
of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost-carrying value
of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating
the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net undiscounted
cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset s
carrying value and estimated fair value. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The Company adopted the framework for measuring
fair value that establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
are described below: 

Basis of Fair Value Measurement 

Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or the liability; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.   

The Company believes that the fair value
of its financial instruments comprising cash, accounts payable, and convertible notes approximate their carrying amounts. As of
August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, the Company had no Level 1 or Level 2 financial assets or liabilities, and Level 3 financial
assets consisted of the Company s derivative liability. 

The following table presents the fair value measurement information
for the Company as of August 31, 2016: 

The following table presents the fair value measurement information
for the Company as of May 31, 2016: 

Income Taxes   

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in
effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the
weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

Share-based Expenses   

ASC 718    Compensation  
Stock Compensation    prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee
services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity
instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values.
That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award,
known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50,    Equity   Based Payments
to Non-Employees   Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever
is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based
payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date. 

Loss per Share   

Basic loss per common share equals net
loss divided by weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share includes the impact on dilution
from all contingently issuable shares, including options, warrants and convertible securities. The common stock equivalents from
contingent shares are determined by the treasury stock method. The Company incurred net losses for the three months ended August
31, 2016 and 2015, and therefore, basic and diluted loss per share for those periods are the same as all potential common equivalent
shares would be antidilutive. For the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had 33,000 common stock warrants
outstanding that were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would be anti-dilutive. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and in August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation
and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. Under ASU 2015-03, debt issuance
costs reported on the consolidated balance sheet would be reflected as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather
than as an asset. While ASU 2015-03 addresses costs related to term debt, ASU No. 2015-15 provides clarification regarding costs
to secure revolving lines of credit, which are, at the outset, not associated with an outstanding borrowing. ASU No. 2015-15 provides
commentary that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements
as an asset and subsequently amortizing them ratably over the term of the revolving debt arrangement. The Company has elected to
implement ASU No. 2015-03 early and the financial statements as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 reflect the early adoption. 

The Company does not expect the adoption
of any other recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. 

Reclassifications   

Certain reclassifications may have been
made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 

Subsequent Events   

The Company has evaluated all transactions
through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued for subsequent event disclosure consideration. 

NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS  

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has a cumulative net loss since inception of $11,605,782,
negative working capital of $1,204,557 and is currently in default on its convertible debt. The Company has required additional
capital raises and advances from shareholders to support its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company's continuation as a going concern is
dependent upon its ability to raise sufficient capital to fund its operations until such time as it can generate revenues. No assurance
can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. 

The consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 4   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

License Agreement with Northwestern University   

On January 26, 2015, the Company entered
into a license agreement with Northwestern University ( Northwestern ). Northwestern is the owner of certain patents
and grants for cancer treatments of which the Company has obtained an exclusive license under a Patent Rights agreement and a non-exclusive
license under a Know-How agreement (together the  Licensed Product ) ( the Northwestern License ). 

The Northwestern License required that
the Company raise $3,000,000 dollars prior to the one year anniversary of the agreement on January 26, 2016. The Company did not
raise the requisite amount of capital and is in default on the license agreement. Although the Company has not received a notice
of default from Northwestern regarding the default, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company recognized an impairment
charge of $198,820 related to the Northwestern License, which represents the net book value of the intangible asset. However, we
maintain a close relationship with Northwestern, as they are a significant shareholder in the Company, and the Inventor of the
Licensed Products sits on our Board of Directors as well as a Professor of Hematology at the Feinberg Medical School (Northwestern s
medical school). 

According to the agreement, the Company
must reach the following milestones to maintain the licenses: 

a)  
      Raise funds of at least $3 million by January 26, 2016.   

b)  
      Initiate good laboratory practices in preclinical studies with a Licensed Product within 18 months of the closing date;   

c)  
      File an Investigational new drug application within 4 years of the closing date;   

d)  
      First dosing of a patient in a phase I clinical trial for a Licensed Product within 5 years of the closing date;   

e)  
      First dosing of a patient in a phase II clinical trial for a Licensed Product within 6 years of the closing date;   

f)  
      First dosing of a patient in a phase III clinical trial for a Licensed Product within eight years of the closing date;   

g)  
      Submit a new drug application for a Licensed Product within 10 years of the closing date;   

h)  
      Complete and submit to Northwestern a business plan for commercialization of a Licensed Product within 1 year of submission of a new drug application ( NDA ) for such Licensed Product.   

In consideration of the license granted
by Northwestern, the Company shall pay to Northwestern the following: 

a)  
      A non-creditable, non-refundable licensing fee of $24,000 within 30 days of the closing date. The license fee was paid during the year ended May 31, 2014. On January 26, 2015, the license deposit was capitalized as part of the intangible license purchase upon closing of the transaction.   

b)  
      In partial consideration of the grant of the exclusive rights and license to the assigned patent rights and non-exclusive license to the know-how of Northwestern, the Company agreed to issue Northwestern a number of shares of its common stock that will represent 2% of the total outstanding shares of the Company and, in consideration of Dr. Sui Huang s role as co-founder and in anticipation of entering into a research agreement with Northwestern to support research in Dr. Sui Huang s laboratory, the Company will issue to Dr. Sui Huang a number of shares of common stock that will represent 2% of the total outstanding shares of the Company; The fair value of the 186,282 common shares, based on the January 26, 2015 closing stock price of $2.01, was $374,427.  The Company recorded an intangible license asset in the amount of $187,214 for the shares owed to Northwestern and recorded share-based compensation of $187,213 for the shares owed to Dr. Sui Huang. As of May 31, 2015 and August 31, 2015, none of these shares had been issued and a stock payable in the amount of $374,427 was recorded. On September 12, 2015, one of the Company s shareholders, and former Chairman of the Board, transferred 186,282 common shares of his own on behalf of the Company for the 4% of outstanding shares to be issued above.   

c)  
      The Company shall pay to Northwestern a non-creditable, non-refundable annual maintenance fee on each anniversary of the closing date according to the following schedule until the Company receives regulatory approval from the Federal Drug Administration (or foreign equivalent) ( Regulatory Approval ) of the first Licensed Product(s):   

In the first full calendar year
following Regulatory Approval, Northwestern shall credit 1/12 of the annual maintenance fee paid by the Company against the minimal
royalty payments (see item (e) below) due for each full month remaining between January 1 of that year and the anniversary of the
closing date. 

d)  
      The following non-creditable and non-refundable milestone payments upon the achievement of particular milestones in the development of Licensed Products (none of which have occurred as of May 31, 2016 and through the date of this filing):   

(1)  
      $25,000 upon filing of Investigational new drug application for a Licensed Product   

(2)  
      $50,000 upon dosing first patient in Phase I trial (or foreign equivalent) for a Licensed Product   

(3)  
      $100,000 upon dosing first patient in Phase II trial (or foreign equivalent) for a Licensed Product   

(4)  
      $250,000 upon dosing first patient in Phase III trial (or foreign equivalent) for a Licensed Product   

(5)  
      $1,500,000 upon Regulatory Approval of a Licensed Product   

e)  
      Beginning the first full calendar year after Regulatory Approval of a Licensed Product in the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, or Italy, or the year 2025, whichever comes first, the Company shall pay to Northwestern minimum royalty payments of $200,000 per year, on a quarterly basis.   

f)  
      The Company will reimburse Northwestern's out of pocket patent expenses totaling approximately $25,000 as of November 18, 2014. All future patent costs for the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the Patent rights, shall be borne by the Company. Payment of out of pocket patent expenses will be deferred until the earlier of a) the date the Company closes on its first round of financing after the closing date or b) one year from the closing date.  None of these events have occurred as of May 31, 2016 and through the date of this filing and the $25,000 reimbursement remains in deferral.   

g)  
      A running royalty of (a) 5% of net sales of Licensed Products if such Licensed Product is covered by patent rights in the country where such Licensed Product is manufactured or sold and (b) 2% of net sales of Licensed Products in all other countries. In the event that Licensee enters into other license agreements) with third parties with respect to intellectual property which in the Company's opinion is legally required for the manufacture, use or sale of Licensed Product(s), the Company may offset amounts paid to such third parties against earned royalties due Northwestern hereunder, by reducing Licensee's obligation to Northwestern by 0.25% for each 1% of royalty rate payable to third parties; provided, however, that in no event will the royalty rate otherwise due to Northwestern be less than 2.5%;   

h)  
      In addition to the running royalties described above, 15% of any payments, including, but not limited to, sublicense issue fees or milestones received from sub licensees as consideration for Patent Rights or Licensed Products prior to filing of an NDA; 5% after filing an NDA;

Blue Print Partners Group   

On April 7, 2015, the Company entered into
a twelve-month consulting agreement with Blue Print Partners and its principal, Tim Boyd, to assist in, among other items, the
daily merger and acquisition activities of the Company, raising capital, and the possible acquisition of pre-identified biotech
assets. Mr. Boyd was to be paid a signing fee of 6,250 shares of the Company s common stock with a fair value of $50,000
on closing and a retainer of $12,500 per month plus out-of-pocket costs. Mr. Boyd would also have been entitled to various success
fees ranging from seven percent (7%) to ten percent (10%), based on the type of transaction, of the total value of any transaction,
and would be payable in shares of the Company s common stock. Mr. Boyd would have earned a success fee of $100,000 plus 10%
of the transaction value in the Company s stock in the event of a closing of a transaction of an acquisition of an agreed
upon target company, a success fee upon the closing of a financing of 5% cash or 10% in Company stock (7% cash or 12% stock for
Mezzanine or Equity financing) if Boyd had introduced us to the investor or lender, or a success fee of $100,000 on the sale of
any of the Company assets through Mr. Boyd. None of these potential targets had been met by Mr. Boyd prior to the termination of
this Agreement. Due to Mr. Boyd s improper and unauthorized activities in a number of transactions, the Company terminated
this agreement on August 18, 2015, and informed Mr. Boyd he would not be receiving any shares and the Company demanded the return
of $10,000 delivered to Mr. Boyd for the purposes of legal fees for a possible transaction. The Company has instituted legal
proceedings against Mr. Boyd due to a pattern of conduct by Mr. Boyd after the consulting agreement was signed that the Company
believes was wholly improper and is seeking significant damages from Mr. Boyd for damages caused due to his actions. The
Company recorded a stock payable of $50,000 for the 6,250 signing fee shares and accrued $25,000 for the April and May retainer
amounts due under the agreement as of May 31, 2015. During the three months ended August 31, 2015, the Company accrued an additional
$37,500 for monthly retainers, pending resolution of this matter. On July 6, 2015, the Company issued 6,250 common shares for the
$50,000 stock payable recorded as of May 31, 2015. The Company filed a 30-day notice of termination on August 31, 2015, and per
the terms of the agreement, the contract was terminated on September 30, 2015. Accordingly, the Company reversed the stock payable
and accrued compensation as of May 31, 2016. 

License Agreement with University
of Rochester   

On April 16, 2015, the Company entered
into an exclusive patent license agreement with University of Rochester ( Rochester ). Rochester grants to the Company
a worldwide exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, for patents and technology related to the treatment
of diabetes (the  Patent Products ). According to the agreement, the Company will reimburse Rochester for all mutually
agreed fees and costs relating to the filing, prosecution, and maintenance of patent applications, including without limitation,
interferences, oppositions, and reexaminations, and the maintenance and defense of patents in patent rights, including fees and
cost incurred on, and after the closing date of the agreement. 

As partial consideration for the rights
conveyed by Rochester under this agreement, the Company agreed to issue 25,437 shares of the Company s common stock to Rochester
as a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable license issue fee valued at $200,000 based upon the average price per share during
the week preceding the closing date, which was $7.86. Rochester may not transfer the shares before August 30, 2016.  The Company
capitalized the $200,000 as an intangible license asset on the consolidated balance sheet. On July 6, 2015, the Company issued
25,437 common shares to settle the $200,000 stock payable recorded as of May 31, 2015. 

In addition to the above license fee, for
the term of the agreement on an annual basis measured from the closing date of the agreement, the Company will pay at the beginning
of the following year a non-refundable minimum annual maintenance fee of $15,000 in cash or Company stock each year prior to the
onset of clinical trials. Rochester will waive the pre-clinical trial annual maintenance fee if the Company spends at least $200,000
annually on the drug development that would enhance the patent rights conveyed. After onset of clinical trials, the Company
will pay a non-refundable minimum annual maintenance fee of $25,000 in cash or Company stock each year or part of year until the
first product is commercialized and sales royalty payments begin. Annual maintenance fees paid in cash will be credited against
the costs of maintaining the Patent Rights for that year. 

During the term of this Agreement, the
Company agreed to pay to Rochester an earned royalty of 5% of the first $10,000,000, 4% of the second $10,000,000, 3% of the third
$10,000,000, 2% of the fourth $10,000,000 in net sales revenue produced from Patent Products, and 1% of all remaining net sales
revenue produced from Patent Products. Earned royalty payments are due and payable within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter. 

The Company agreed to pay to Rochester
50% of all cash and non-cash consideration derived from sublicenses granted by the Company in Patent Products, excluding earned
royalties, loans, equity investments, and research and development support. 

The Company agreed to pay Rochester the
milestone payments per product as set forth below: 

a)  
      If the Company sponsors Phase I, II and III clinical trials, the Company will pay $500,000 within 30 days of approval of any Patent Product;   

b)  
      If the Company sells a controlling interest in or sublicenses substantially all of the Patent Products before the initiation of Phase II clinical trial, the Company will pay:   

As of August 31, 2016, and through the
date of this filing, none of the milestones noted above for Rochester have been met. 

The term of this Agreement will commence
on the closing date and will end upon the latest of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the Patent Products; or
(ii) the 10-year anniversary of commercial launch of any Patent Product. 

The University of Rochester License required
that the Company spend $200,000 annually on drug development or pay an annual maintenance fee of $15,000 in cash or an equivalent
number of the Company s common stock. The Company has defaulted on these requirements. Although the Company has not received
a notice of default from Rochester regarding the default, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $191,667 related to the
Rochester License, which represents the net book value of the intangible license, during the year ended May 31, 2016. 

Alchemia Oncology / Blueprint Partners
Dispute   

On June 27, 2015, the Company entered into
a binding term sheet to acquire Alchemia Oncology Pty LTD ( Alchemia ), a subsidiary of Alchemia LTD listed on the
Australian Stock Exchange (the  Alchemia Term Sheet ). The transaction was brought to the Company by Tim Boyd of Blueprint
Partners, whom the Company engaged to seek potential acquisitions of Australian biotechnology candidates on a success fee basis,
see Note 4. Mr. Boyd identified and negotiated directly with Alchemia and agreed on the transaction terms. Mr. Boyd subsequently
presented those terms to the Company. Mr. Boyd guaranteed the due diligence and a financing of $10,000,000 should the Company engage
in the transaction, with a short term guarantee of $500,000 simply to execute the term sheet. The agreement that Mr. Boyd negotiated
required a final mutually agreed upon asset purchase agreement containing certain milestone achievements in the short term, including
but not limited to, a filing of an S-1 registration statement and applying for a listing on the NASDAQ. The acquisition consideration
was $15,000,000 worth of the Company s common shares. The guaranteed price of the first tranche of the Blueprint Partners
financing was $5 per share. The Company believed the transaction to be of minimal risk. However, the initial failure of Blueprint
to deliver the financing, of which an initial $500,000 was guaranteed with five days from the date of the signing of the term sheet,
resulted in the failure to achieve certain milestones per the term sheet which then subjected the Company to a breakup fee of $500,000.
The Company takes the position that it is not liable if such fee were ever pursued due to the failure of Blueprint to deliver the
financing. The Company was unable to agree upon the terms of the asset purchase agreement as well as unable to achieve the milestones
on a timely basis due to both Alchemia withholding critical data and Mr. Boyd improperly misrepresenting his ability to deliver
the requisite financing concurrent with the execution of the term sheet. In addition, the Company discovered questionable board
relationships and practices amongst Alchemia and Mr. Boyd. Also, certain statements and actions from Alchemia appeared contradictory
to the expectations of the relationship. The Company made every attempt to resolve the situation, however, the Company suspects
that possible collusion amongst the parties made the transaction absolutely impossible to consummate. Currently there is no negotiation
or agreement in place. The Company believes it is entitled to damages and has initiated litigation against Tim Boyd and Blueprint
Partners and is evaluating whether other parties should be part of the litigation in any capacity. This is not expected to have
a material impact on the Company. 

In December 2015, the Company received
a demand letter for payment under the Alchemia Term Sheet demanding $500,000 for the breakup fee and an additional $75,000 for
operational expenses. The Company has delivered a demand letter to Alchemia asserting its rights to void the agreement in light
of irregularities that have been brought to the Company s attention. Neither Alchemia nor the Company have initiated legal
action regarding the Alchemia Term Sheet. The Company intends to mount a vigorous defense in the event that suit is brought by
Alchemia and will pursue counterclaims against Alchemia in the event a lawsuit is filed against the Company by Alchemia. 

Stock Purchase Agreement   

On August 28, 2015, the Company entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement with a private non-affiliated investor to sell 33,000 shares of the Company s common stock,

warrant for the right to purchase 33,000 shares at a purchase price of $6.00 per share. The warrant expires on August 27, 2020.
The investor also received 22,000 shares of the Company s common stock, with a fair market value of $112,200 based on our
stock closing price of $5.10 that vested over six months, as consideration for a one year consulting agreement to the Company.
The investor has agreed to assist the Company in the capacity of investor relations, introductions to potential public market investors
in the Chicago area, business development and facilitating with potential synergistic corporate alliances, and potential alliances
with medical practices, etc. in the Chicago area.

NOTE 8   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  

On August 20, 2015, the Company issued
a convertible note agreement with a variable conversion feature that gave rise to an embedded derivative instrument. The derivative
feature has been valued using a binomial lattice-based option valuation model using holding period assumptions developed from the
Company's business plan and management assumptions, and expected volatility from comparable companies including OTC Pink  and
small-cap companies. Increases or decreases in the Company's share price, the volatility of the share price, changes in interest
rates in general, and the passage of time will all impact the value of the derivative instrument. The Company re-values the derivative
instrument at the end of each reporting period and any changes are reflected as changes in derivative liabilities in the consolidated
statements of operations. The assumptions used are as follows: 

(1) The market value of common stock is
based on closing market price as of initial valuation date. 

 (2) The adjusted conversion price is calculated
based on conversion terms described in the note agreement. 

 (3) The risk-free interest rate was determined
by management using the 2 year Treasury Bill as of the respective Offering or measurement date. 

 (4) The volatility factor was estimated
by management using the historical volatilities of the Company s stock. 

 (5) Management determined the dividend
yield to be 0% based upon its expectation that it will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 

The initial valuation of the derivative
liability was $380,995 on August 20, 2015, the date of the initial valuation, $295,883 on May 31, 2016, and $558,403 on August
31, 2016. The increase of $394,843 in the derivative liability was recorded on the consolidated statements of operations. 

NOTE 9   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  

In June and July 2016, the Company entered

with respect to a proposed acquisition whereby the shareholders of Brown would exchange all of their outstanding capital stock
with the Company, in consideration for approximately 12 million shares of the Company s common stock, plus certain earn-out
rights, the result of which will be that Brown would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the  Exchange ).

Results of Operations   

The following table provides selected financial
data about our Company as of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016. 

The decrease in cash is attributed to the
cash used in operations of $85,886 during the three-month period ended August 31, 2016.  Our liabilities increased $304,050
due primarily to the increase in the derivative liability. 

The following summary of our results of
operations, for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements, as included in this Form 10-Q. 

The following summarizes our results
of operations for the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015:  

Revenue  

We have no sources of revenue. 

Expenses  

Operating expenses for the three months
ended August 31, 2016, decreased $5,942,637 compared to the comparative period in 2015, from $6,051,149 to $108,512. The decrease
in expenses can be primarily attributed to a decrease in share-based compensation of $5,532,053, Depreciation and amortization
decreased $6,850, from $13,778 to $6,928. Impairment of intangibles decreased $390,487, from $390,487 to $0 as a result of the
impairment of the University of Rochester and Northwestern University licenses in the prior year that did not recur in the current
year. 

Other expenses changed from $106,130 in
the prior year to other expense of $313,274, for an increase of $207,144 which is composed of loss on debt extinguishment of $17,142,
increase in the change in derivative liability of $410,082, from ($15,239) in the prior year to $262,520 in the current year, and
a change in interest expense of $7,563. Loss on sale of subsidiary of $80,194 was incurred in the prior year and not in the current
year. 

Limited Operating History; Need for
Additional Capital  

There is limited historical financial information
about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are a development stage company and generated limited revenues from
operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations.  Our business is subject to risks
inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in our rebranding
efforts, and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Currently we do not have sufficient capital
to fund our business development for the next 12 months. We feel we do have enough funds to cover our operating expenses for the
next 12 months. We have no committed source of outside future financing. Our current directors have provided some funds to
cover some of the Company's costs. 

Working Capital  

Cash Flows  

As of August 31, 2016, the Company's cash
balance was $65,526 compared to $108,912 as of May 31, 2016 and our total assets were $308,701 compared with $358,937 as of
May 31, 2016. The decrease in cash was due to the use of cash to fund operations and repay debt. The change in total assets was
primarily due amortization of license agreement costs and the use of cash to fund operations and repay debt. 

As of August 31, 2016, the Company had
total liabilities of $1,270,083 compared with $966,033 as of May 31, 2016.  Our liabilities increased $304,050 primarily
due to the increase in derivative liability of $262,520. 

As of August 31, 2016, the Company had
a working capital deficit of $1,204,557 compared with a working capital deficit of $857,121 as of May 31, 2016. The increase
in our working capital deficit was primarily attributed to the increase in derivative liability of $262,520. 

Cash Flow from Operating Activities  

During the three months ended August 31,
2016, the Company used $85,886 in operating activities, compared to the $55,843 of cash used by operating activities during the three
months ended August 31, 2015. 

Cash Flow from Financing Activities  

During the three months ended August 31,
2016, the Company received gross proceeds of $67,500 from the sale of common stock during the quarter compared to the prior year
when the Company had $220,000 in cash from financing activities due to proceeds from issuance of a convertible note. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

We prepare our consolidated financial statements
in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments
on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated
financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain,
materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we
review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

While we believe that the historical experience,
current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As of August 31, 2016, management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission ( COSO ) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during
the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application
of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal
controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

The matters involving internal controls
and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting
in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management dominated by a single individual without adequate compensating
controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officer in connection with
the review of our financial statements as of August 31, 2016. 

Management believes that the material weaknesses
set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit
committee, which has been rectified as of the filing date of this document, and the lack of a majority of outside directors on
our board of directors, which has also been rectified by the filing date of this document, results in ineffective oversight in
the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in
our financial statements in future periods. 

Changes in Internal Controls  

There have been no changes in our internal
controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Securities Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF
PROCEEDS

into stock purchase agreements with private investors to sell 450,000 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $67,500
at a price of $0.15 per share. 

On October 19, 2016, the Company issued 85,574 shares of its common

in the ten (10) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable payment date.

 AGREEMENT

EX-10.6  

TYPENEX NOTE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT 

This Note Settlement
Agreement (this   Agreement  ) is entered into as of October 5, 2016 (the   Effective Date  )
by and between Typenex Co-Investment, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (  Lender  ), and Panther Biotechnology,
Inc., a Nevada corporation (  Borrower  ). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement without definition shall have
the meanings given to them in the Note (defined below). Each of Borrower and Lender is sometimes referred to herein individually
as a   Party   and collectively as the   Parties .  

A.               
 Borrower previously sold and issued to Lender that certain Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated August 20, 2015 in
the original principal amount of $1,215,000.00 (the   Note  ) pursuant to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement
dated August 20, 2015 by and between Lender and Borrower (the   Purchase Agreement ,  and together with the Note
and all other documents entered into in conjunction therewith, the   Transaction Documents  ). 

B.               
 On March 30, 2016, Lender delivered to Borrower a certain notice outlining the occurrence of various Events of Default under
the Transaction Documents (the   Defaults  ). 

C.               
 As a result of the Defaults, on or around April 25, 2016, Lender filed a lawsuit against Borrower in the Third Judicial
District Court of Salt Lake County, State of Utah (the   Lawsuit  ) and initiated arbitration against Borrower
by delivering an Arbitration Notice pursuant to Section 10.2 and Exhibit H of the Purchase Agreement (the   Arbitration  ). 

D.               
 Lender and Borrower now desire to restructure and settle the Note on the terms and conditions set forth herein and to stay
the Lawsuit and the Arbitration. 

NOW, THEREFORE, for
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 

1.                
  Recitals and Definitions . Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the recitals set forth above in
this Agreement are true and accurate, are contractual in nature, and are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement. 

2.                
  Settlement Amount . Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of the Note, Borrower covenants and agrees to pay to
Lender $265,000.00 plus accrued interest thereon (the   Settlement Amount  ) in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. The Settlement Amount will be due and payable to Lender in fourteen (14) payments (each such payment,
an   Amortization Payment  ). The first thirteen (13) Amortization Payments will be in the amount of $20,000.00
each and the fourteenth (14 th ) Amortization Payment will be in the amount of the unpaid balance of the Settlement Amount.
The first Amortization Payment is due and payable to Lender on or before October 21, 2016, and each successive Amortization Payment
is due and payable to Lender on or before the fifth (5 th ) day of each month thereafter until November 5, 2017 (each
such date, a   Payment Date  ). The first thirteen (13) Amortization Payments shall be made as follows: (i) $10,000.00
in cash, and (ii) if elected by Lender in its sole discretion, up to $10,000.00 in shares of Borrower s Common Stock (  Payment
Shares  ); provided that any portion of any Amortization Payment that is paid via Payment Shares (the   Conversion
Amount  ) shall be subject to the following conditions: (a) the number of Payment Shares deliverable with respect to any
portion of any Amortization Payment made in Common Stock shall be equal to the Conversion Amount divided by the Market Price (as
defined below); (b) all Payment Shares must be delivered in the manner set forth in Section 9 of the Note; and (c) the applicable
Payment Shares must have been received by Lender or its broker, as applicable, and become Free Trading within three (3) Trading
Days of the delivery of the Conversion Notice (as defined below) for such Amortization Payment to be deemed to have been timely
made. The fourteenth (14 th ) and final Amortization Payment shall be made in cash. If Lender elects to receive a particular
Conversion Amount via Payment Shares, then in such event Lender will deliver a conversion notice (a   Conversion Notice  )
to Borrower setting forth the number of Payment Shares deliverable with respect to such Conversion Amount. Any Payment Shares delivered
pursuant to this Section 2 shall be subject to a true-up in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 11 of the Note.
In addition, if any Conversion Amount in any month is less than $10,000.00, then in the following month or months Lender shall
be allowed to convert an amount equal to the difference between the amounts Lender was allowed to convert and the amounts Lender
actually converted. For illustration purposes only, if Lender s aggregate Conversion Amounts during the first two (2) months
following the Effective Date were $15,000.00, then Lender would be entitled to convert a Conversion Amount of up to $15,000.00
in the next month (the $10,000 available for conversion during such third month, plus the $5,000.00 carryover from the first two
(2) months). If Lender s aggregate Conversion Amounts during the third month following the Effective Date were $12,000.00
for purposes of this example, then Lender would be entitled to convert a Conversion Amount of up to $13,000.00 during the following
month. For purposes hereof the term   Market Price   shall mean 60% multiplied by the average of the three (3)
lowest Closing Bid Prices in the ten (10) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Payment Date. 

3.               
   Prepayment . Borrower shall have the right, exercisable at any time in Borrower s
sole discretion, to prepay the Settlement Amount, in full, prior to the final Payment Date without any prepayment penalty.  

4.                
  Interest . Beginning on the Effective Date, Interest shall accrue on the Settlement Amount at the rate of 10% per
annum. All interest calculations hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve (12) thirty
(30) day months and shall compound daily. Interest shall be calculated, due and payable with the 14 th  payment. 

5.                
  Share Reserve . Within three (3) Trading Days of the Effective Date, Borrower agrees to cause its transfer agent to
increase the Share Reserve (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) to 3,750,000 shares of Common Stock and to cause its transfer
agent to provide confirmation to Lender that such increase in the Share Reserve has been completed. 

6.                
  Forbearance . Subject to the terms, conditions and understandings contained in this Agreement, Lender hereby agrees
to refrain and forbear from exercising and enforcing its remedies under the Note, any of the Transaction Documents or under applicable
law, for so long as Borrower is not in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation making
all Amortization Payments as and when due (the   Forbearance  ). For the avoidance of doubt, the Forbearance shall
automatically terminate immediately upon the occurrence of any material breach of this Agreement (including without limitation
any failure of Borrower to make any Amortization Payment when due) and in such event Lender may seek all recourse available to
it under the terms of the Note, this Agreement, or any other Transaction Document. 

7.                
  Payment in Full . Upon satisfaction of all of Borrower s obligations under this Agreement, including, without
limitation, timely payment of all Amortization Payments to Lender or otherwise paying the entire Settlement Amount, Borrower shall
be deemed to have paid the entire Outstanding Balance of the Note in full and shall have no further obligations under the Note.
In addition, upon satisfaction of all of Borrower s obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation payment
of all Amortization Payments or otherwise paying the Settlement Amount to Lender in full, the Transaction Documents will terminate
and shall be deemed to be of no further force or effect, and the Parties shall be released from all obligations, definitions, representations
and commitments therein. 

8.                
   Failure to Comply . Should Borrower fail to comply with any of the conditions set forth herein, including without
limitation failing to make any Amortization Payment when due hereunder (including timely delivery of any Payment Shares), if Borrower
has not previously repaid the Settlement Amount in full, all accommodations given herein shall immediately and automatically be
deemed withdrawn and Lender shall be entitled to all remedies available to it at law, in equity or as otherwise set forth in the
Note, the other Transaction Documents, and this Agreement, including without limitation accelerating Borrower s obligation
to repay the entire Outstanding Balance of the Note in full (as such Outstanding Balance is calculated pursuant to the terms of
the Note and notwithstanding any reductions thereof or other accommodations granted herein) and Default Interest shall begin accruing
on such Outstanding Balance. In the event Borrower has made any Amortization Payments hereunder, but fails to make all Amortization
Payments when due hereunder, Lender shall apply the Amortization Payments previously made against the Outstanding Balance of the
Note. 

9.                
  Stay of Lawsuit and Arbitration . Upon execution of this Agreement, the Parties agree to cause the Lawsuit and the
Arbitration to be stayed. The Parties further agree to cooperate with each other to the extent reasonably necessary in the filing
of any documents necessary to stay the Lawsuit and the Arbitration. In addition, the Parties also agree to dismiss the Lawsuit
and the Arbitration with prejudice once Borrower s obligations hereunder have been satisfied in full (including, without
limitation, timely payment of all Amortization Payments to Lender or otherwise paying the entire Settlement Amount). 

10.             
  Ownership Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if at any time Lender
shall or would be issued shares of Common Stock hereunder, but such issuance would cause Lender (together with its affiliates)
to beneficially own a number of shares exceeding 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date (including
for such purpose the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such issuance) (the   Maximum Percentage  ), then Borrower
must not issue to Lender shares of Common Stock which would exceed the Maximum Percentage. For purposes of this section, beneficial
ownership of Common Stock will be determined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. The shares of Common Stock issuable to
Lender that would cause the Maximum Percentage to be exceeded are referred to herein as the   Ownership Limitation Shares  .
Borrower will reserve the Ownership Limitation Shares for the exclusive benefit of Lender. From time to time, Lender may notify
Borrower in writing of the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares that may be issued to Lender without causing Lender to exceed
the Maximum Percentage. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower shall be unconditionally obligated to immediately issue such designated
shares to Lender, with a corresponding reduction in the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares. By written notice to Borrower,
Lender may increase, decrease or waive the Maximum Percentage as to itself but any such waiver will not be effective until the
61st day after delivery thereof. The foregoing 61-day notice requirement is enforceable, unconditional and non-waivable and shall
apply to all affiliates and assigns of Lender. 

11.             
   Representations, Warranties and Agreements . In order to induce Lender to enter into this Agreement, Borrower,
for itself, and for its affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby acknowledges, represents, warrants and agrees as follows: 

11.1.         
   Authority . Borrower has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to incur and perform all
obligations and covenants contained herein, all of which have been duly authorized by all proper and necessary action. No consent,
approval, filing or registration with or notice to any governmental authority is required as a condition to the validity of this
Agreement or the performance of any of the obligations of Borrower hereunder. 

11.2.         
   No Waiver . Any Event of Default which may have occurred under any Note has not been, is not hereby, and shall
not be deemed to be waived by Lender, expressly, impliedly, through course of conduct or otherwise except upon full satisfaction
of Borrower s obligations under this Agreement. The agreement of Lender to refrain and forbear from exercising any rights
and remedies by reason of any existing default or any future default shall not constitute a waiver of, consent to, or condoning
of, any other existing or future default. 

11.3.         
   Accurate Representations . All understandings, representations, warranties and recitals contained or expressed
in this Agreement are true, accurate, complete, and correct in all respects; and no such understanding, representation, warranty,
or recital fails or omits to state or otherwise disclose any material fact or information necessary to prevent such understanding,
representation, warranty, or recital from being misleading. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Lender has been induced in part
to enter into this Agreement based upon Lender s justifiable reliance on the truth, accuracy, and completeness of all understandings,
representations, warranties, and recitals contained in this Agreement. There is no fact known to Borrower or which should be known
to Borrower which Borrower has not disclosed to Lender on or prior to the date hereof which would or could materially and adversely
affect the understandings of Lender expressed in this Agreement or any representation, warranty, or recital contained in this Agreement. 

11.4.         
   No Defenses  .  Borrower has no defenses, affirmative or otherwise,
rights of setoff, rights of recoupment, claims, counterclaims, actions or causes of action of any kind or nature whatsoever against
Lender, directly or indirectly, arising out of, based upon, or in any manner connected with, the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether known or unknown, which occurred, existed, was taken, permitted, or begun prior to the execution of this Agreement and
occurred, existed, was taken, permitted or begun in accordance with, pursuant to, or by virtue of any of the terms or conditions
of the Transaction Documents. To the extent any such defenses, affirmative or otherwise, rights of setoff, rights of recoupment,
claims, counterclaims, actions or causes of action exist or existed, such defenses, rights, claims, counterclaims, actions and
causes of action are hereby waived, discharged and released. Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that the execution of this
Agreement by Lender shall not constitute an acknowledgment of or admission by Lender of the existence of any claims or of liability
for any matter or precedent upon which any claim or liability may be asserted. 

11.5.         
   Voluntary Agreement  .  Borrower hereby acknowledges that it has

or other governmental or judicial authority by reason of such party having or being deemed to have structured, dictated, or drafted
such provision. 

11.6.         
   No Proceedings  .  There are no proceedings or investigations pending
or threatened before any court or arbitrator or before or by, any governmental, administrative, or judicial authority or agency,
or arbitrator, against Borrower. 

11.7.         
   No Statutes  .  There is no statute, regulation, rule, order or
judgment and no provision of any mortgage, indenture, contract or other agreement binding on Borrower, which would prohibit or
cause a default under or in any way prevent the execution, delivery, performance, compliance or observance of any of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and/or any of the other documents executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement. 

11.8.

force and effect. 

13.5.         
   Successors . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns. This Agreement or any of the severable rights and obligations inuring to the benefit of or to be performed by Lender
