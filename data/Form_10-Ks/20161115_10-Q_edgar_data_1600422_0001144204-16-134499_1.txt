NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   

Nature of Operations  

We are a drilling and completion tool technology company. We design and manufacture new drill bit and
horizontal drill string enhancement tools and refurbish PDC (polycrystalline diamond compact) drill bits for the oil, natural gas
and mining services industry. Our customers are engaged in domestic and international exploration and production of oil and natural
gas . We were incorporated on December 10, 2013 under
the name SD Company, Inc. to facilitate (a) the reorganization of the entities that are now our consolidated subsidiaries and (b)
the subsequent acquisition of Hard Rock Solutions, LLC, we changed our name from SD Company Inc. to Superior Drilling Products,
Inc. on May 22, 2014. The closing of that reorganization occurred in conjunction with our initial public offering which was completed
on May 23, 2014.  Our headquarters and principal manufacturing operations are located in Vernal, Utah.   

Basis of Presentation  

The
accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, and of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries (a) Superior Drilling Solutions, LLC (previously known as Superior Drilling Products, LLC), a Utah limited liability
company ( SDS ), together with its wholly owned subsidiary, Superior Design and Fabrication, LLC, a Utah limited liability
company ( SDF ), (b) Extreme Technologies, LLC, a Utah limited liability company ( ET ), (c) Meier Properties
Series, LLC, a Utah limited liability company ( MPS ), (d) Meier Leasing, LLC, a Utah limited liability company ( ML ),
and (e) Hard Rock Solutions, LLC, a Utah limited liability company ( HR ). These consolidated condensed financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ),
and all significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 

As
a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during its last fiscal year, which completed its initial public offering after
December 2011, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS
Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public
companies that are not an  emerging growth company.  

Unaudited Interim Financial
Information  

These
interim consolidated condensed financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related
footnote disclosures included herein, are unaudited. However, in the opinion of management, these unaudited interim financial statements
have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements, and reflect all adjustments necessary to fairly state
the results for such periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results of operations expected for the year ended December 31, 2016. These interim consolidated condensed financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the notes thereto, which were included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). 

Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share  

Basic earnings per
common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated to give effect to potentially issuable common shares, which include stock warrants. 

Effective with its
IPO in May 2014, the Company had warrants exercisable for 714,286 shares of common stock at $4.00 per share. These warrants have
a four-year term expiring in February 2018. These warrants were anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015. 

On August 5, 2016, the Company issued warrants exercisable for 250,000 shares of common stock at $1.00
per share as part of the Bridge Financing (as defined in Note 5 below). These warrants have a five-year term expiring in August
2021. These warrants were anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

During
the month of March 2016, the Board of Directors granted options to acquire 309,133 shares of stock from the Company s 2015
Long Term Incentive Plan to directors, officers and employees. All options were anti-dilutive for earnings per share for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Revenue Recognition  

The
Company operates as a drilling and completion tool technology company that sells, rents and repairs/refurbishes drill string enhancement
tools and drill bits for use by customers engaged in the oil and gas and mining industries. Revenue is classified into two groups:
(1) Tool Revenue, which consists of revenue from tool sales, tool rental and other related revenue, and (2) Contract Services,
which consists of drill bit manufacturing and refurbishment revenue and revenue from the sale of other machined tools. 

Tool sales, rentals and other related
revenue.     We rent or sell our tools and repair the tools we manufacture. In some instances, such as with the
Drill-N-Ream   , we may receive royalty revenue based on the activity of the tools by end users. 

Tool Sales : Revenue
for tool sales is recognized upon shipment of tools. 

Tool Rental :
Rental revenue is recognized upon completion of the customer s job for which the tool was rented. While the duration of the
rents vary by job and number of runs, these rents are generally less than one month. The rental agreements are typically based
on the price per run or footage drilled and do not have any minimum rental payments or term. 

Other Related Revenue :
We receive revenue from the repair of tools upon delivery of the repaired tool to the customer. R oyalty
revenue is recognized when our customer invoices their customer for the use of our tools.   

Contract Services   

Drill Bit Manufacturing
and Refurbishment : Since 1996, we have refurbished PDC drill bits for Baker Hughes. We are currently operating under a four-year vendor agreement with Baker Hughes (the  Vendor Agreement ) that was renewed in 2014. We recognize revenue
for our PDC drill bit services upon shipment of the drill bit. Shipping and handling costs related to refurbishing services are
paid directly by Baker Hughes at the time of shipment. By contract, we can only refurbish and manufacture oil or gas drill bits
for Baker Hughes, but we are not contractually prohibited from manufacturing drill bits for the mining industry. 

Other Machined Tools .  We also design and manufacture other new tools and component parts for other oil and gas
industry participants from time to time. We recognize revenue for the manufacture of other machined tools and parts upon their
shipment to the customer. Shipping and handling costs related to product sales are recorded gross as a component of both the sales
price and cost of the product sold. 

Income Taxes  

The Company recognizes
an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of all temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities
and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the
reported amounts of the asset or liabilities are recovered or settled and for operating loss carry forwards. These deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse
and the carry forwards are expected to be realized. As of September 30, 2016, the Company adjusted the current income tax payable
of $2,000 down to $0 and a full valuation allowance has been applied to the deferred tax assets. 

Share-Based Compensation  

The Company
follows ASC 718,  Compensation- Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition
of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, including restricted stock units, based on estimated grant date fair
values. Restricted stock units are valued using the market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The Company records
compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. 

On
March 4, 2016, the Board of Directors granted options to acquire 78,944 shares of stock from the Company s 2015 Long Term
Incentive Plan to officers and employees based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant,
which was $1.73. These options vested 100% on the grant date and have a ten-year term expiring on March 4, 2026. The fair value
of the vested stock options were calculated using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility and discount rate over the expected
term of each employee. 

On
March 18, 2016, the Board of Directors granted options to acquire 81,714 shares of stock from the Company s 2015 Long Term
Incentive Plan to officers and employees based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant,
which was $1.67. These options vested 100% on the grant date and have a ten-year term expiring on March 18, 2026. The fair value
of the vested stock options were calculated using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility and discount rate over the expected
term of each employee. 

On
March 31, 2016, the Board of Directors granted options to acquire 148,475 shares of stock from the Company s 2015 Long Term
Incentive Plan to directors, officers and employees based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date
of the grant, which was $1.37. These options vested 100% on the grant date and have a ten year term expiring on March 31, 2026.
The fair value of the vested stock options were calculated using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility and discount rate over
the expected term of each employee. 

These three issuances of options issued during March 2016 were part of decreasing the base salary of employees
and directors in exchange for salary for options plan, issued out of the 2015 Incentive Plan. 

Liquidity  

At September 30, 2016,
we had working capital of approximately $1.5 million. Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations, the
March 2016 credit facility with Federal National Commercial Credit ( FNCC ) and the August 5, 2016, Bridge Financing
intended to provide us with liquidity until we could close the public offering (see Note 5: Long-term Debt and Note 9: Subsequent
Events). Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service
payments. 

Public Offering: 
On September 30, 2016, we priced a public offering of common stock at $1.00 per share. The transaction closed on October 5, 2016
and was recorded as a receivable and common stock subscribed. Net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses,
net proceeds were approximately $5.1 million. The Company used the proceeds to repay its $1 million Bridge Financing, FNCC indebtedness
and pay the remaining $500,000 plus accrued interest on the Hard Rock Note (see Note 5   Long-term Debt). We will use the
remaining funds from the offering and cash flows from operations to service on going debt obligations, which include real property
leases and equipment loans, as well as for general corporate purposes, including growth working capital (see Note 9 - Subsequent
Events). 

Our operational and financial strategies include lowering our operating costs and capital spending to
match revenue trends, managing our working capital and managing our debt to enhance liquidity. We will continue to work to grow
revenue and review additional cost cutting measures with the plan to be cash flow positive. If we are unable to do this, we may
not be able to, among other things, (i) maintain our current general and administrative spending levels; (ii) fund certain obligations
as they become due; and (iii) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements. The Company may need to raise
additional capital through equity and debt financing to support its business and possible expansions thereof and for its corporate
general and administrative expenses. While the Company is considering a full range of financing options, we cannot provide any
assurance that financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms. 

Accounting Standards  

In
April 2015, FASB issued an accounting standards update for  Interest   Imputation of Interest,  which simplifies
the presentation of debt issuance costs. This accounting standard update requires that debt issuance cost related to a recognized
debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent
with debt discounts. The new update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2015 (and interim periods within those fiscal years). The adoption of this new accounting standard update resulted in a reclassification
of debt issuance costs from Other assets to Line of Credit, net and Long term debt, net. See Note 5 - Long-Term Debt for disclosure
of debt issuance costs. Adoption of this accounting standard update did not impact our statements of operations or cash flows. 

NOTE 2. INVENTORY  

Inventory is comprised of
the following: 

During the year, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Drilling Tools International ( DTI ),
under which DTI has a requirement to purchase our Drill-N-Ream tool for their rental tool business and achieve market share requirements
in order to maintain exclusive marketing rights for the Drill-N-Ream. This agreement began the change of direction of our business
from renting tools to selling tools. Due to this change in our business model, we have moved our tools from property, plant and
equipment (PP E) into inventory. As a result, inventory increased $218,965. 

NOTE 3. PROPERTY, PLANT
AND EQUIPMENT  

Property, plant and equipment
are comprised of the following: 

Depreciation
expense related to PP E for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $320,583 and $1,544,215, respectively, and
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $608,881 and $1,691,028, respectively. 

As noted in Note 2   Inventory, the Company executed a distribution agreement with DTI, under which
DTI purchases our Drill-N-Ream tool for their rental tool business. As a result, the tools we had manufactured for rental that
had been recognized in Machinery and equipment were recategorized as inventory. Also, we sold Transportation assets that were no
longer needed for our new business model. The resulting gross impact to PP E was a reduction in Machinery and equipment of
the original cost of the tools of $1,902,081 and $304,000 from sales of Transportation assets. 

NOTE 4. INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

Intangible assets are comprised
of the following: 

Amortization
expense related to intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $611,667 and $1,835,000, respectively,
and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was $611,667 and $1,835,000, respectively. 

Annually, and more
often as necessary, we will perform an evaluation of our intangible assets for indications of impairment. If indications exist,
we will perform an evaluation of the fair value of the intangible assets and, if necessary, record an impairment charge. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company reviewed the net balance of the intangible assets and determined no impairment was needed. 

NOTE 5. LONG-TERM DEBT  

Long-term debt is comprised
of the following: 

Hard Rock Note:  On August 10, 2016,
certain of our subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated note with the seller in our acquisition of Hard Rock Solutions,
LLC (as so amended and restated, the  Hard Rock Note ). As amended and restated, the Hard Rock Note accrues interest
at 5.75% per annum and matures and is fully payable on January 15, 2020. Under the current terms of the Hard Rock Note, we are
required to make the following payments: $1,500,000 of principal plus accrued interest on or before October 15, 2016; accrued interest
only on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2017; $500,000 in principal plus accrued interest on each of January
15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2018, and $1,000,000 in principal plus accrued interest on each of January 15, March 15, May
15 and July 15, 2019. The remaining balance of principal of $2,000,000 and accrued interest on the Hard Rock Note are due on January
15, 2020. 

We made an interest
payment of approximately $304,000 on the Hard Rock Note on August 5, 2016. In addition, we issued 700,000 restricted shares of
common stock on August 10, 2016 (having an agreed per share value of $1.43, or $1,000,000 in the aggregate) as payment for $1,000,000
of the $1,500,000 of principal due in 2016. On October 15, 2016, we paid $606,000 in principal and accrued interest for the remaining
amounts due in 2016. On October 21, 2016, the Company filed a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of the
700,000 shares of restricted stock. Additional interest will continue to accrue on the Hard Rock Note based on the $1,000,000 value
of the shares until such shares are registered. 

FNCC Lending Agreement: 
On March 8, 2016, we entered into a $3 million financing agreement with FNCC. The financing agreement included a $500,000 term
loan collateralized with previously unencumbered manufacturing equipment and a $2.5 million accounts receivable revolving credit
facility allowing up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable. This credit facility included a personal guarantee from Troy Meier.
As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the revolving promissory note was $490,608. The net availability from the
revolving promissory note as of September 30, 2016 was $0. At September 30, 2016, we were not in compliance with all financial
covenants under the FNCC facility and we received a forbearance concerning the terms of the debt. 

Following the receipt
of proceeds received on October 5, 2016 from the common stock offering, the term loan and revolver were repaid and the agreements
were terminated. (see Subsequent Events   Footnote 9). 

Previous to its termination
upon repayment, the revolving promissory note had availability of up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable of the borrowers. The
note had a variable interest rate of prime plus 1% plus a monthly service fee of 0.48% of the current outstanding balance on the
note. The term loan was for a period of 60 months with monthly principal payments of $8,333 plus monthly variable interest, with
a balloon payment at the end of the term. The note carried an interest rate of prime plus 5% plus a monthly service fee of 0.30%
of the outstanding balance. 

The credit facility
had also included the following debt covenants: (a)  Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio  of not less than 0.10 tested monthly from
July 30 through August 31, 2016, then 0.35 for September 30 and October 31, 2016, and then 1.00 for November 30, 2016 and each
month thereafter; (b)  Debt-to-Tangible Net Worth  of not greater than 4.35 tested monthly from June 30 through August 31,
2016 and then 4.25 for September 30, 2016 and each month thereafter; and (c)  Liquid Ratio  of at least 0.325 tested monthly
from June 30 through September 30, 2016 and then 0.40 for October 30, 2016 and each month thereafter. 

Bridge Financing: 
On August 5, 2016, we entered into a private transaction with a private investor pursuant to which we issued a promissory note
in the aggregate principal amounts of $1,000,000 and a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 250,000 shares of our common stock,
subject to certain adjustments to the number of shares and the exercise price described in the warrants (together, the  Bridge
Financing ). These warrants were valued at $112,024, based on using the Black Scholes model and were recorded as a liability.
These warrants have a five-year term and were valued at $1.00 per share as of September 30, 2016. Following the closing of our
public offering of common stock on October 5, 2016, we repaid the Bridge Financing. (see Subsequent Events   Footnote 9). 

The warrants associated
with the Bridge Financing were treated as derivatives. We used the Black Scholes model to determine the fair market value of the
warrants of $140,325 as of August 5, 2016 and $112,024 as of September 30, 2016. The difference of $28,301 is recorded as an unrealized
gain on the income statement. The variable inputs used in the Black Scholes calculation were; expected volatility of 95%, discount
rate of 0.72% and the term of the warrants of 5 years. On August 5, 2016, these warrants were recorded as a discount on the note,
which were subject to amortization based upon the 5 years, of which 2 months were recorded as interest expense as of September
30, 2016. 

The Bridge Financing accrued interest at the rate of 8% per annum. Until the payment in full of the indebtedness
under the note, we agreed not to grant, convey, create or impose any lien or security interest on any of our real or personal property
other than liens existing on the date of the note. We paid in full all amounts outstanding under the note using a portion of the
proceeds of our public offering of common stock completed in October 2016. 

NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

We
are subject to litigation that arises from time to time in the ordinary course of our business activities. We are not currently
involved in any litigation which management believes could have a material effect on   our financial
position or results of operations, except as follows:  

Del Rio Suit  

In
October 2013, Del-Rio Resources, Inc. ( Del-Rio ) filed suit, on its own behalf and derivatively on behalf of Philco
Exploration, LLC ( Philco ), against the following co-defendants (a) Tronco Ohio, LLC and Tronco, (b) the lender on
the Tronco loan, ACF Property Management, Inc. (p.k.a. Fortuna Asset Management, LLC, ) ( ACF ), (c) Troy and Annette
Meier personally, and several of their family trusts, (d) Meier Family Holding Company, LLC and Meier Management Company, LLC,
and (e) SDS and MPS. That suit is currently pending in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Uintah County, Utah under   Cause
#130800125.  

Tronco
and Del-Rio are the sole owners and managers of Philco. Philco served as the exploration operator. Part of the collateral for the
Tronco loan is Philco s mineral leases. Del- Rio s suit alleges that the defendants made amendments to the Tronco loan
without complying with the   voting provisions of Philco s operating agreement, and that
all of the Meier-related entities somehow benefitted from the Tronco loan proceeds, in an unspecified manner. Del-Rio s suit
seeks to invalidate ACF s deeds of trust on the Philco mineral leases, and to acquire title to those Philco mineral leases.
ACF no longer has deeds of trust of any of the Philco mineral leases. Del Rio is also requesting monetary and punitive damages,
disgorgement, prejudgment interest, post judgment interest, costs, and attorney fees, against all defendants, in an amount to be
determined at trial.  

We
believe that Del-Rio s claims are without merit, and all defendants are actively defending in this matter. In particular,
SDS  and MPS  only involvement was to grant guaranties and/or security interests in their respective separate personal
and real property to ACF to additionally collateralize the Tronco loan before its purchase by us. In addition, since the Meiers 
and their personal trusts guaranty repayment of the Tronco loan, we believe that the basis of Del-Rio s damages claims are
nullified. Consequently, we do not believe that Del Rio s purported claims against SDS and MPS will have any material adverse
effect on our cash flow, business, or operations. As of September 30, 2016, there have been no updates or decisions made concerning
this matter. 

NOTE 7. RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS  

On January 1, 2016,
the Company completed the divestiture of our interest in Superior Auto Body and Paint ( SAB ), by selling the remaining
ownership interests in the business operations to a third party. The Company hired an independent third party evaluation firm to
determine the value of the operations of SAB. The Firm determined the value was $101,400 for the portion owned by the Company.
The Company received $50,700 in cash and a note receivable for $50,700. The note requires eight monthly payments of $5,633, which
include principal and interest. The final payment of the outstanding balance, including principal and interest, is due on November
24, 2016. This note is shown as other current assets. 

The
Company will continue to lease certain of its facilities to SAB. We recorded rental income from the related party in the amounts
of $49,976 and $149,928, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Tronco Related Loans  

In
January 2014, we entered into a Note Purchase and Sale Agreement under which we agreed to purchase a loan made to Tronco Energy
Corporation ( Tronco ), a party   related to us through common control, in order
to take over the legal position as Tronco s senior secured lender. That agreement provided that, upon our full repayment
of the Tronco loan from the proceeds of the Offering, the lender would assign to us all of its rights under the Tronco loan, including
all of the collateral documents. On May 30, 2014, we closed our purchase of the Tronco loan for a total payoff of $8.3 million,
including principal, interest, and early termination fees. As a result of that purchase, we became Tronco s senior secured
lender and are entitled to receive all proceeds from sales of the Tronco-owned collateral, as discussed below.   

With
the Tronco loan, we have the direct legal right to enforce the collateral and guaranty agreements entered into in connection with
the Tronco loan and to collect Tronco s collateral sales proceeds, in order to recover the loan purchase amount. The Tronco
loan continues to be secured by the first position liens on all of Tronco assets, as well as by the guarantees of Troy and Annette
Meier (the  Meier Guaranties ), which are directly payable to and legally enforceable by us. In addition, the Meiers
have provided us with stock pledges in which they pledge all of their shares of our common stock held by their family entities
(the    Meier Stock Pledge   ), as collateral for the Meiers  guaranties until full repayment
of Tronco loan. The certificates representing the 8,814,860 pledged shares are being held in third-party escrow until full repayment
of the Tronco loan. At a $0.95 per share price at closing of the NYSE MKT on September 30, 2016, the pledged shares would currently
have a market value of over $8.4 million, more than the amount necessary to repay the Tronco loan, even if no Tronco assets were
sold. 

During
July 2014, the Board of Directors agreed to restructure the Tronco loan effective May 29, 2014. As part of this restructuring the
interest rate was decreased to the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank plus 0.25%, which was 3.75% as of March 31, 2016. The payment
requirements and schedule were also changed with the restructuring. Only interest was due on December 31, 2014, and a balloon payment
of all unpaid interest and principal was due in full at maturity on December 31, 2015. As of November 10, 2015, the Board of Directors
agreed to extend the terms of the Tronco loan to interest only payments due on December 31, 2015 and 2016, with a balloon payment
of all unpaid interest and principal due in full maturity on December 31, 2017. The Meiers made the December 31, 2015 interest
payment by offsetting amounts due against their Founders notes. 

Other Related Party
Transactions  

On October 5, 2016,
the Company closed a public offering of 5,750,000 shares of common stock at $1.00 and 1,000,000 of these shares were purchased
by executive management. 

NOTE 8. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  

On June 15, 2015, our
stockholders approved the Superior Drilling Company, Inc. 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan (the  2015 Incentive Plan ).
The purpose of the 2015 Incentive Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing an incentive
to attract, retain and reward persons performing services for the Company and its affiliates and by motivating such persons to
contribute to the growth and profitability of the Company and our affiliates. Subject to adjustment as provided in the 2015 Incentive
Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of the Company s common stock that may be issued with respect to awards under
the 2015 Incentive Plan is 1,592,878. 

On
March 4, 2016, the Board of Directors granted options to acquire 78,944 shares of stock from the Company s 2015 Incentive
Plan to officers and employees based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant, which was
$1.73. These options vested 100% on the grant date and have a ten year term expiring on March 4, 2026. The fair value of the vested
stock options were calculated using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility and discount rate over the expected term of each
employee. 

On
March 18, 2016, the Board of Directors granted options to acquire 81,714 shares of stock from the Company s 2015 Incentive
Plan to officers and employees based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant, which was
$1.67. These options vested 100% on the grant date and have a ten year term expiring on March 18, 2026. The fair value of the vested
stock options were calculated using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility and discount rate over the expected term of each
employee. 

On
March 31, 2016, the Board of Directors granted options to acquire 148,475 shares of stock from the Company s 2015 Incentive
Plan to directors, officers and employees based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant,
which was $1.37. These options vested 100% on the grant date and have a ten-year term expiring on March 31, 2026. The fair value
of the vested stock options were calculated using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility and discount rate over the expected
term of each employee. 

These three issuances of options issued during March 2016 were part of decreasing the base salary of employees
and directors in exchange for salary for options plan, issued out of the 2015 Incentive Plan. 

The fair value of stock
options granted to employees and directors was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the
following assumptions: 

NOTE 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

1. Closing of public offering of common
stock and repayment of certain debt obligations 

On October 5, 2016, the Company closed a public offering of 5,750,000 shares of common stock at $1.00
and 1,000,000 of these shares were purchased by executive management. This offering providing $5.1 million of cash to the Company,
net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. The company incurred approximately $200,000 of legal, audit and
other related expenses. The Company used the proceeds to pay off the Bridge Financing and FNCC indebtedness, and made a payment
on the Hard Rock Note. The balance was used for general corporate purposes, including growth working capital (see Note 1  
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Liquidity and Note 5   Long-term Debt).

Overview  

We are a drilling and
completion tool technology company. We design and manufacture new drill bit and horizontal drill string enhancement tools and refurbish
PDC (polycrystalline diamond compact) drill bits for the oil, natural gas and mining services industry. Our customers are primarily
engaged in domestic and international exploration and production of oil and natural gas. 

We currently have three
basic operations: 

Our PDC drill bit and other tool refurbishing and manufacturing service,   

Our emerging technologies business that manufactures the Drill-N-Ream  well bore conditioning
tool, our innovative drill string enhancement tool, the Strider Oscillation System and other tools, and   

Our new product development business that conducts our research and development, and designs our
horizontal drill string enhancement tools, other down-hole drilling technologies, and drilling tool manufacturing technologies.   

From our headquarters
in Vernal, Utah, we operate a technologically-advanced PDC drill bit refurbishing facility, as well as a state-of-the-art, high-tech
drilling tool engineering design and manufacturing operation. We manufacture our drill string enhancement tools, including the
patented Drill-N-Ream  well bore conditioning tool and patent-pending Strider Oscillation system, and conduct our new product
research and development from this facility. 

Our co-founder, Troy
Meier, developed the first commercially-viable process for refurbishing PDC drill bits after a successful 13-year career with a
predecessor of our largest client, Baker Hughes. For the past 20 years, we have exclusively provided our PDC drill bit refurbishing
services for the Rocky Mountain, California and Alaska regions of Baker Hughes s substantial oilfield operations. In addition,
we have expanded our offerings and our customer base by demonstrating our engineering, design and manufacturing expertise of down-hole
drilling tools. We continuously work with our customers to develop new products and enhancements to existing products, improve
efficiency and safety, and solve complex drilling tool problems. 

We employ a senior
work force with specialized training and extensive experience related to drill bit refurbishing and tooling manufacturing. They
produce our products and services using a suite of highly technical, purpose-built equipment, much of which we design and manufacture
for our proprietary use. Our manufacturing equipment and products use advanced technologies that enable us to increase efficiency,
enhance product integrity, improve efficiency and safety, and solve complex drilling tool problems. 

In 2016, the Company
entered into an agreement with Drilling Tools International ( DTI ), under which DTI has a requirement to purchase
our Drill-N-Ream tool for their rental tool business and achieve market share requirements in order to maintain exclusive marketing
rights for the Drill-N-Ream. This agreement began the change of direction of our business model from a rental tool company to a
manufacturer that designs, builds and sells tools. DTI, has exclusive rights to market the Drill-N-Ream in the U.S., both on shore
and off shore, and in Canada. It must achieve defined market share goals with our tool starting in June 2017 that increase through
to the end of 2020. We receive revenue from DTI for tool sales, tool repairs and a royalty fee based on the tools usage. 

We were incorporated
on December 10, 2013 under the name SD Company, Inc. in order to facilitate (a) the reorganization of the entities that are now
our consolidated subsidiaries and (b) the subsequent acquisition of Hard Rock Solutions, LLC ( HR ). We changed our
name from SD Company Inc. to Superior Drilling Products, Inc. on May 22, 2014 in conjunction with closing of that reorganization
and our initial public offering which occurred on May 23, 2014 ( Offering  or  IPO ). Our corporate headquarters
and manufacturing operations are located in Vernal, Utah. Our common stock trades on the NYSE MKT exchange under the ticker symbol
 SDPI . 

Our subsidiaries include
(a) Superior Drilling Solutions, LLC (previously known as Superior Drilling Products, LLC), a Utah limited liability company ( SDS ),
together with its wholly owned subsidiary Superior Design and Fabrication, LLC, a Utah limited liability company ( SDF ),
(b) Extreme Technologies, LLC, a Utah limited liability company ( ET ), (c) Meier Properties Series, LLC, a Utah limited
liability company ( MPS ), (d) Meier Leasing, LLC, a Utah limited liability company ( ML ), (e) HR. 

Oil and Gas Drilling Industry  

Overview   

Drilling and completion
of oil and gas wells are part of the oilfield services group within the energy industry. The drilling industry is often segmented
into the North American market and the International market. These markets share common exposure to the same macro environment,
but also exhibit unique factors that drive the dynamics of each market. 

Oilfield services companies
drill the wells for hydrocarbon exploration and production companies. Demand for onshore drilling is a function of the willingness
of exploration and production companies to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons.
When oil or natural gas prices increase, exploration and production companies generally increase their capital expenditures, resulting
in greater revenue and profits for both drillers and equipment manufacturers. Likewise, as discussed below under  Trends
in the Industry,  significant decreases in the prices of those commodities typically lead exploration and production companies,
as we have seen over the last 18 months, to reduce their capital expenditures, which decreases the demand for drilling equipment. 

Trends in
the Industry  

Declining Rig Count;
Industry Volatility.  Our business is highly dependent upon the vibrancy of the oil and gas drilling operations in the
U.S. Worldwide military, political and economic events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely
to continue to do so in the future. Beginning in the latter half of 2014 and through early 2016, oil prices dramatically declined
in the United States and as a result, the number of operating drill rigs has measurably been reduced. The NYMEX-WTI oil price was
as low as $26.19 in February 2016, while the NYMEX-Henry Hub natural gas price was as low as $1.77 per MMBtu in May 2016. The Baker
Hughes weekly rotary rig count decreased over 70% from the high of 1,840 on December 24, 2014 to a historic low of 404 as of May
27, 2016. Both 2015 and the first half of 2016 were very challenging for us as we worked to expand market share of our Drill-N-Ream   
well bore conditioning tool and introduce the Strider Oscillation System against these massive headwinds. 

While
Baker Hughes is a leading supplier of drill bits to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry globally, our business
with them decreased measurably during this time as a result of the decline in drilling activity. This severely impacted both pricing
and volume for drill bit refurbishment. We are contracted with Baker Hughes to serve the Rocky Mountain region that includes the
Bakken shale formation in North Dakota. This region is higher cost production and as such, the drill rig count reduction has been
more dramatic than the overall U.S rig count decline. The U.S. rig count has increased from the historic low of 404 in May to 569
as of November 4, 2016. 

Advent
of horizontal drilling requires new technologies . We believe the value of our Drill-N-Ream  and Strider Oscillation System
combined with our low market penetration provide us sales opportunities despite current market conditions. Our plan is for tool
manufacturing to help offset the decline in our PDC drill bit refurbishment business and our third-party manufacturing services
business. 

The
oil and gas industry is increasingly using directional (e.g., horizontal) drilling in their exploration and production activities
because of measurably improved recovery rates that can be achieved with these methods. With the rise of this type of drilling,
traditional drill string tools used for vertical drilling do not necessarily provide the best performance or are not well suited
for directional drilling. 

We
believe that our Drill-N-Ream  well bore conditioning tool and Strider Oscillation System have proven to provide significant
operational efficiencies and costs savings for horizontal drilling activity. In addition, we are developing additional technologies
to take advantage of the oil and gas industry s significant shift to horizontal/directional drilling and its resulting need
for new drill string tools and technology. 

We
expect that with our extensive knowledge and experience in the oilfield industry, we can identify additional challenges with directional
drilling, and then design and develop tools that will help our customers with their drilling challenges. Further development of
additional drill string components, such as our Drill-N-Ream  and Strider Oscillation System, will become increasingly important
to our business as we continue to grow through both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions. 

GE
Oil   Gas to merge with Baker Hughes . During 2016, GE Oil and Gas announced its planned merger with Baker Hughes.
Currently Baker Hughes is our sole customer for our bit refurbishment business and we do not know how this acquisition may
impact our business. Despite this, we intend to continue developing our long-time relationship with Baker Hughes. During the
month of January 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Baker Hughes to supply the Strider tool and related
services to Baker Hughes. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following table represents our condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the periods indicated: 

Material changes of certain items in our
statements of operations included in our financial statements for the comparative periods are discussed below. 

During 2016, the Company changed its revenue
model from primarily renting tools to primarily selling tools. As previously noted, the Company entered into a distribution agreement
with DTI, under which they purchase our Drill-N-Ream tool for their rental tool business. As part of this agreement, DTI also hired
much of our field sales team and the related vehicles associated with our previous rental tool business. Thus, rental and sales
revenue changed significantly during this quarter and cost of sales decreased measurably due to the change in our business model. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 (third quarter
2016), as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015 (third quarter 2015)    

Revenue .  Our
revenue decreased approximately $756,000, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015.
The decrease was mostly related to the decline in refurbishing business, reflecting the significant decline in oil prices and
drill rigs. Tool revenue in the third quarter 2016 was $1,845,000 which was comprised of approximately $93,000 of rental tool
revenue, approximately $1,633,000 in tool sales and $119,000 of other related revenue. This was down $145,000 from tool revenue
of $1,990,000, comprised of approximately $1,831,000 of rental tool revenue and $159,000 of other related revenue, in the third
quarter of 2015. Contract services revenue was down a measurable $611,000 to approximately $417,000 in the third quarter 2016
from approximately $1,028,000 in the three months ending September 30, 2015. 

Operating Costs
and Expenses .  Total operating costs and expenses decreased approximately $1,385,000 during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. 

Cost of revenue decreased approximately $550,000 in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the
prior-year period. The decrease was a partial reflection of the decrease in revenue and our cost cutting measures in 2016. See
discussion of DTI agreement above.   

Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) decreased approximately $547,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to layoffs
and other cost saving measures due to the downturn of the oil industry.   

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately $288,000 primarily attributable to
the depreciation of the Hard Rock assets, which decreased due to the change of the Drill-N-Ream tool being reclassified as inventory
instead of a machinery, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.   

Other Income (Expenses) .  Other
income and expense primarily consists of rent income, interest income, interest expense and loss on disposition of assets. 

Other Income.  We receive rent from the real property lease, which is the lease of the Superior
Auto Body facilities by a related party. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, lease payments decreased by approximately
$7,000 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to no longer leasing our Vernal property.   

Interest Income.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 interest income
was approximately $79,000 and $73,000, respectively, which increase was mainly due to interest received from the Tronco loan (see
Note 7  Related Party Transaction - Tronco Related Loans in our consolidated condensed financial statements included herein).   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
with the nine months ended September 30, 2015    

Revenue  .  Our
revenue decreased approximately $5,153,000, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015.
The decrease was due to decline in tool related revenue and our refurbishing business. Tool revenue for the 2016 year-to-date
period was $3,687,000. This was comprised of $1,414,000 of rental tool revenue, approximately $2,060,000 in tool sales and $213,000
of other related revenue. This compared with tool revenue of $5,997,000 comprised of approximately $5,555,000 of rental tool revenue
and $442,000 of other related revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Contract services was down measurably from
approximately $3,977,000 during the nine months ending September 30, 2015 to approximately $1,133,000 for the same period in 2016.
The decline was the significantly lower U.S. rig count in 2016 resulting from the oil industry slowdown.  

Operating Costs
and Expenses .  Total operating costs and expenses decreased approximately $3,405,000 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. 

SG A decreased approximately $1,557,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
with the same period in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to layoffs and other cost saving measures due to the downturn of the
oil industry.   

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately $147,000 primarily attributable to
the depreciation of the Hard Rock assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The
decrease is also due to HR tools being shifted from PPE to inventory and depreciation expense decreasing by approximately $321,000.   

Other Income (Expenses) .  Other
income and expense primarily consists of rent income, interest income, interest expense and loss on disposition of assets. 

Other Income.  We receive rent from two real property leases: one lease of a building on
our Vernal campus and the second for the lease of the Superior Auto Body facilities by a related party. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, lease payments decreased by approximately $27,000 as compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
due to a decrease in rental income from our Vernal property.   

Interest Income.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 interest income was
approximately $235,000 and $220,000, respectively, which increase was mainly due to interest received from the Tronco loan (see
Note 7  Related Party Transaction - Tronco Related Loans in our consolidated condensed financial statements included herein).   

Liquidity  

At September 30, 2016,
we had working capital of approximately $1.5 million. Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations and
borrowings. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service
payments. Given the current environment of the oil and gas industry, revenue and, therefore, cash from operations, have been severely
impacted. Our operational and financial strategies include lowering our operating costs and capital spending to match revenue trends,
managing our working capital and managing our debt to enhance liquidity. We will continue to work to grow revenue and review additional
cost cutting measures with the plan to be cash flow positive. If we are unable to do this, we may not be able to, among other things,
(i) maintain our current general and administrative spending levels; (ii) fund certain obligations as they become due; and (iii)
respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements. We cannot provide any assurance that financing will be
available to us in the future on acceptable terms. 

Public Offering: 
On September 30, 2016, we priced a public offering of common stock at $1.00 per share. The transaction closed on October 5, 2016
and was recorded as a receivable and common stock subscribed. Net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses,
net proceeds were approximately $5.1 million. The Company used the proceeds to repay its $1 million Bridge Financing, FNCC indebtedness
and pay the remaining $500,000 plus accrued interest on the Hard Rock Note (see Note 5   Long-term Debt). We will use the
remaining funds from the offering and cash flows from operations to service on going debt obligations, which include real property
leases and equipment loans, as well as for general corporate purposes, including growth working capital (see Note 9 - Subsequent
Events). 

Hard Rock Note: 
On August 10, 2016, certain of our subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated note with the seller in our acquisition of
Hard Rock Solutions, LLC (as so amended and restated, the  Hard Rock Note ). As amended and restated, the Hard Rock
Note accrues interest at 5.75% per annum and matures and is fully payable on January 15, 2020. Under the current terms of the Hard
Rock Note, we are required to make the following payments: $1,500,000 of principal plus accrued interest on or before October 15,
2016; accrued interest only on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2017; $500,000 in principal plus accrued interest
on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2018, and $1,000,000 in principal plus accrued interest on each of January
15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2019. The remaining balance of principal of $2,000,000 and accrued interest on the Hard Rock
Note are due on January 15, 2020. 

We made an interest
payment of approximately $304,000 on the Hard Rock Note on August 5, 2016. In addition, we issued 700,000 restricted shares of
common stock on August 10, 2016 (having an agreed per share value of $1.43, or $1,000,000 in the aggregate) as payment for $1,000,000
of the $1,500,000 of principal due in 2016. On October 15, 2016, we paid $606,000 in principal and accrued interest for the remaining
amounts due in 2016. On October 21, 2016, the Company filed a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of the
700,000 shares of restricted stock. Additional interest will continue to accrue on the Hard Rock Note based on the $1,000,000 value
of the shares until such shares are registered. 

FNCC Lending Agreement: 
On March 8, 2016, we entered into a $3 million financing agreement with FNCC. The financing agreement included a $500,000 term
loan collateralized with previously unencumbered manufacturing equipment and a $2.5 million accounts receivable revolving credit
facility allowing up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable. This credit facility included a personal guarantee from Troy Meier.
As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the revolving promissory note was $490,608. The net availability from the
revolving promissory note as of September 30, 2016 was $0. At September 30, 2016, we were not in compliance with all financial
covenants under the FNCC facility and we received a forbearance concerning the terms of the debt. 

Following the receipt
of proceeds received on October 5, 2016 from the common stock offering, the term loan and revolver were repaid and the agreements
were terminated. (see Subsequent Events   Footnote 9). 

Previous to its termination
upon repayment, the revolving promissory note had availability of up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable of the borrowers. The
note had a variable interest rate of prime plus 1% plus a monthly service fee of 0.48% of the current outstanding balance on the
note. The term loan was for a period of 60 months with monthly principal payments of $8,333 plus monthly variable interest, with
a balloon payment at the end of the term. The note carried an interest rate of prime plus 5% plus a monthly service fee of 0.30%
of the outstanding balance. 

The credit facility
had also included the following debt covenants: (a)  Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio  of not less than 0.10 tested monthly from
July 30 through August 31, 2016, then 0.35 for September 30 and October 31, 2016, and then 1.00 for November 30, 2016 and each
month thereafter; (b)  Debt-to-Tangible Net Worth  of not greater than 4.35 tested monthly from June 30 through August 31,
2016 and then 4.25 for September 30, 2016 and each month thereafter; and (c)  Liquid Ratio  of at least 0.325 tested monthly
from June 30 through September 30, 2016 and then 0.40 for October 30, 2016 and each month thereafter. 

Bridge Financing: 
On August 5, 2016, we entered into a private transaction with a private investor pursuant to which we issued a promissory note
in the aggregate principal amounts of $1,000,000 and a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 250,000 shares of our common stock,
subject to certain adjustments to the number of shares and the exercise price described in the warrants (together, the  Bridge
Financing ). These warrants were valued at $112,024, based on using the Black Scholes model and were recorded as a liability.
These warrants have a five-year term and were valued at $1.00 per share as of September 30, 2016. Following the closing of our
public offering of common stock on October 5, 2016, we repaid the Bridge Financing. (see Subsequent Events   Footnote 9). 

Prior to its repayment, the Bridge Financing accrued interest at the rate of 8% per annum. Until the payment
in full of the indebtedness under the note, we agreed not to grant, convey, create or impose any lien or security interest on any
of our real or personal property other than liens existing on the date of the note. We paid in full all amounts outstanding under
the note using a portion of the proceeds of our public offering of common stock completed in October 2016. 

Cash Flow 

Operating
Cash Flows   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used by our operating activities was approximately
$1,482,000. The Company had approximately $6,515,000 of net loss, approximately $648,000 decrease in accounts receivable, an increase
in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $496,000 and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $3,379,000. 

Investing Cash Flows  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by our investing activities was approximately
$168,000, which was used for property, plant and equipment purchases. 

Financing
Cash Flows   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by our financing activities was approximately
$349,000, primarily attributable to payments on long-term debt and long-term capital lease obligations. Subsequent to the end of
the reported period, the Company received $5.1 million in proceeds from our recently completed public offering of common stock. 

Critical
Accounting Policies  

The discussion of our
financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated condensed financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. During the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those discussed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis
for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. While
we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated condensed financial statements are appropriate,
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may
be material to our consolidated condensed financial statements. Our estimates and assumptions are evaluated periodically and adjusted
when necessary. The more significant estimates affecting amounts reported in our consolidated condensed financial statements include,
but are not limited to: determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of long-lived assets, useful lives used
in calculating depreciation and amortization, and accounting for the Hard Rock Acquisition. 

Revenue Recognition 

We generate revenue from the refurbishment, manufacturing, repair, rental and sales of drill string tools.
Our manufactured products are produced in a standard manufacturing operation, even when produced to our customer s specifications.
We also earn royalty fees under certain arrangements for the tools we sell. The Company has entered into an agreement with DTI
to be our exclusive distributor of the Drill-N-Ream tool in the United States and Canada. This agreement began the change of direction
of our business from renting tools to selling tools. 

Tool sales, rentals and other related
revenue.     We rent or sell our tools and repair the tools we manufacture. In some instances, such as with the
Drill-N-Ream   , we may receive royalty revenue based on the activity of the tools by end users. 

Tool Sales : Revenue
for tool sales is recognized upon shipment of tools. 

Tool Rental :
Rental revenue is recognized upon completion of the customer s job for which the tool was rented. While the duration of the
rents vary by job and number of runs, these rents are generally less than one month. The rental agreements are typically based
on the price per run or footage drilled and do not have any minimum rental payments or term. 

Other Related Revenue :
We receive revenue from the repair of tools upon delivery of the repaired tool to the customer. R oyalty
revenue is recognized when our customer invoices their customer for the use of our tools.   

Contract Services   

Drill Bit Manufacturing
and Refurbishment : Since 1996, we have refurbished PDC drill bits for Baker Hughes. We are currently operating under a four-year
vendor agreement with Baker Hughes that was renewed in 2014. We recognize revenue for our PDC drill bit services upon shipment
of the drill bit. Shipping and handling costs related to refurbishing services are paid directly by Baker Hughes at the time of
shipment. By contract, we can only refurbish and manufacture oil or gas drill bits for Baker Hughes, but we are not contractually
prohibited from manufacturing drill bits for the mining industry. 

Other Machined Tools .  We
also design and manufacture other new tools and component parts for other oil and gas industry participants from time to time.
We recognize revenue for the manufacture of other machined tools and parts upon their shipment to the customer. Shipping and handling
costs related to product sales are recorded gross as a component of both the sales price and cost of the product sold. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

On June 15, 2015, our
stockholders approved the Superior Drilling Company, Inc. 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan (the  2015 Incentive Plan ).
The purpose of the 2015 Incentive Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing an incentive
to attract, retain and reward persons performing services for the Company and its affiliates and by motivating such persons to
contribute to the growth and profitability of the Company and our affiliates. Subject to adjustment as provided in the 2015 Incentive
Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of the Company s common stock that may be issued with respect to awards under
the 2015 Incentive Plan is 1,592,878. 

On
March 4, 2016, the Board of Directors granted options to acquire 78,944 shares of stock from the Company s 2015 Incentive
Plan to officers and employees based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant, which was
$1.73. These options vested 100% on the grant date and have a ten year term expiring on March 4, 2026. The fair value of the vested
stock options were calculated using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility and discount rate over the expected term of each
employee. 

On
March 18, 2016, the Board of Directors granted options to acquire 81,714 shares of stock from the Company s 2015 Incentive
Plan to officers and employees based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant, which was
$1.67. These options vested 100% on the grant date and have a ten year term expiring on March 18, 2026. The fair value of the vested
stock options were calculated using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility and discount rate over the expected term of each
employee. 

On
March 31, 2016, the Board of Directors granted options to acquire 148,475 shares of stock from the Company s 2015 Incentive
Plan to directors, officers and employees based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant,
which was $1.37. These options vested 100% on the grant date and have a ten year term expiring on March 31, 2026. The fair value
of the vested stock options were calculated using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility and discount rate over the expected
term of each employee. 

These
three issuances of options issued during March 2016 were part of decreasing the base salary of employees and directors in exchange
for salary for options plan, which came from the employee long term incentive plan. 

Concentration of Credit Risk   

Historically, substantially
all of our revenue was derived from our refurbishing of PDC drill bits and our manufacturing of the Drill-N-Ream units. However,
after the Hard Rock Acquisition, our historical HR revenue and accounts receivable percentages became spread out among our drill
bit refurbishment customers and Hard Rock s rental tool customers. Subsequently we entered into an exclusive United States
and Canada distribution agreement with DTI for the Drill-N-Ream. As a result of this agreement, the majority of our revenue is
now concentrated between our two largest customers, Baker Hughes and DTI. 

Accounts Receivable; Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts   

Accounts receivable
are generally due within 60 days of the invoice date. No interest is charged on past-due balances. We grant credit to our customers
based upon an evaluation of each customer s financial condition. We periodically monitor the payment history and ongoing
creditworthiness of our customers. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established at a level estimated by management to be adequate
based upon various factors including historical experience, aging status of customer accounts, payment history and financial condition
of our customers. As of September 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015, management determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts
was deemed necessary due to our expectation that the Company will collect all amounts owed. 

Intangible Assets   

Annually, and more
often as necessary, we will perform an evaluation of our intangible assets for indications of impairment. If indications exist,
we will perform an evaluation of the fair value of the intangible assets and, if necessary, record an impairment charge. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company performed an evaluation of the intangible assets. From this analysis we have determined no impairment
was needed. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

Our management, with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of
the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 due to certain material
weaknesses. 

A material weakness
is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a possibility
that a material misstatement in our interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the
course of our assessment, management identified that the Company has a lack of staffing within its accounting department, in terms
of the small number of employees performing its financial and accounting functions, which does not provide the necessary segregation
of duties surrounding the cash disbursements process. Management believes the lack of accounting and financial personnel amounts
to a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting ability to adequately prepare financial statements and
disclosures, and a lack of accounting expertise to appropriately apply GAAP for complex and non-routine transactions. As a result,
at September 30, 2016 and on the date of this Report, its internal control over financial reporting is not effective. 

To remediate these
issues, management has retained the services of additional third party accounting personnel as well as to modify existing disclosure
controls and procedures in a manner designed to ensure future compliance. Our management currently believes the additional accounting
resources will remediate the weakness with respect to insufficient personnel. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting  

None 

Internal Controls and Procedures  

We are not currently
required to comply with the SEC s rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and are therefore
not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose.
As a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC s rules implementing Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, which requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and we
will be required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
We will not be required to make our first assessment of our internal control over financial reporting until year end 2016. 

Further, our independent
registered public accounting firm is not yet required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
reporting, and will not be required to do so for as long as we are an  emerging growth company  pursuant to the provisions
of the JOBS Act. 

PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

We
are subject to litigation that arises from time to time in the ordinary course of our business activities. We are not currently
involved in any litigation which management believes could have a material effect on   our financial
position or results of operations, except as follows:  

In
October 2013, Del-Rio Resources, Inc. ( Del-Rio ) filed suit, on its own behalf and derivatively on behalf of Philco
Exploration, LLC ( Philco ), against the following co-defendants (a) Tronco Ohio, LLC and Tronco Energy Corporation
( Tronco ), (b) the lender on the Tronco loan, ACF Property Management, Inc. (p.k.a. Fortuna Asset Management, LLC,
) ( ACF ), (c) the Meiers personally, and several of their family trusts, (d) Meier Family Holding Company, LLC and
Meier Management Company, LLC, and (e) SDS and MPS. That suit is currently pending in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Uintah
County, Utah under   Cause #130800125.  

Tronco
and Del-Rio are the sole owners and managers of Philco. Philco served as the exploration operator. Part of the collateral for the
Tronco loan is Philco s mineral leases. Del- Rio s suit alleges that the defendants made amendments to the Tronco loan
without complying with the   voting provisions of Philco s operating agreement, and that
all of the Meier-related entities benefitted from the Tronco loan proceeds, in an unspecified manner. Del-Rio s suit seeks
to invalidate ACF s deeds of trust on the Philco mineral leases, and to acquire title to those Philco mineral leases. ACF
no longer has deeds of trust of any of the Philco mineral leases. Del Rio is also requesting monetary and punitive damages, disgorgement,
prejudgment interest, post judgment interest, costs, and attorney fees, against all defendants, in an amount to be determined at
trial.  

We
believe that Del-Rio s claims are without merit, and all defendants are actively defending in this matter. In particular,
SDS  and MPS  only involvement was to grant guaranties and/or security interests in their respective separate personal
and real property to ACF to additionally collateralize the Tronco loan before its purchase by us. In addition, since the Meiers 
and their personal trusts guaranty repayment of the Tronco loan, we believe that the basis of Del-Rio s damages claims are
nullified. Consequently, we do not believe that Del Rio s purported claims against SDS and MPS will have any material adverse
effect on our cash flow, business, or operations. As of September 30, 2016, there have been no updates or decisions made concerning
this matter. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Due to reduced commodity prices and
the unprecedented rapid decline in the rig count during 2015 and 2016 to historic lows, we had measurably lower operating cash
flows. As a result of this situation coupled with pending payments required on our indebtedness, we may be unable to maintain adequate
liquidity and make payments on our debt.   

At September 30, 2016,
we had working capital of approximately $1.5 million. During 2015 and into 2016, our principal sources of liquidity were cash flow
from operations and our new credit facility with Federal National Commercial Credit ( FNCC ). In addition, on August
5, 2016, we completed the Bridge Financing to provide us with liquidity until we could close the public offering described below.
Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service payments.
Given the current environment of the oil and gas industry, our revenue has dramatically declined in 2015 and 2016. 

On September 30,
2016, we priced a public offering of common stock at $1.00 per share. The transaction closed on October 5, 2016 and was recorded
as a receivable and common stock subscribed. Net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, net proceeds were
approximately $5.1 million. The Company used the proceeds to pay off the Bridge Financing and its indebtedness with FNCC, as well
as for general corporate purposes, including working capital. 

As amended and restated
effective August 10, 2016, the Hard Rock Note accrues interest at 5.75% per annum and matures and is fully payable on January 15,
2020. Under the current terms of Hard Rock Note, and after the payment described below, we are required to make the following payments:
accrued interest on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2017, $500,000 (plus accrued interest) on each of January
15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2018, and $1,000,000 (plus accrued interest) on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July
15, 2019, with the remaining balance of principal and accrued interest on the Hard Rock Note due on January 15, 2020. 

In connection with
the amendment and restatement, we made an interest payment of approximately $304,000 on the Hard Rock Note. In addition we issued
700,000 restricted shares of common stock (having an agreed per share value of $1.43, or $1,000,000 in the aggregate) as payment
for $1,000,000 of the $1,500,000 due on the Hard Rock Note on or before October 15, 2016. Interest will continue to accrue on the
Hard Rock Note based on the $1,000,000 value of the shares until the resale of such shares is registered with the SEC. 

Our operational and financial strategies
include lowering our operating costs and capital spending to match revenue trends, managing our working capital and managing our
debt to enhance liquidity. For example, to conserve cash, we implemented a salary for stock options program during the first quarter
of 2016 for senior management and our board of directors. We do not currently have all of the financial resources to fully develop
and execute on all of our strategies. We will need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financing to support our
operations and for our corporate general and administrative expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that financing will be available
to us in the future on acceptable terms. 

We will continue to work to grow revenue
and review additional cost cutting measures with the plan to be cash flow positive. If we are unable to do this, we may not be
able to, among other things, (i) maintain our current general and administrative spending levels; (ii) fund certain obligations
as they become due; and (iii) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements. 

Failure to generate sufficient revenue to make payments
on the Hard Rock Note could result in our loss of the patents securing such note.   

On August 10, 2016, certain of our subsidiaries
entered into an amended and restated note with the seller in our acquisition of Hard Rock Solutions, LLC (as so amended and restated,
the  Hard Rock Note ). As amended and restated, the Hard Rock Note accrues interest at 5.75% per annum and matures
and is fully payable on January 15, 2020. Under the current terms of the Hard Rock Note, we are required to make the following
payments: $1,500,000 of principal plus accrued interest on or before October 15, 2016; accrued interest only on each of January
15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2017; $500,000 in principal plus accrued interest on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and
July 15, 2018, and $1,000,000 in principal plus accrued interest on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2019. The
remaining balance of principal of $2,000,000 and accrued interest on the Hard Rock Note are due on January 15, 2020. 

The Hard Rock Note
is secured by all of the patents, patents pending, other patent rights, and the Drill-N-Ream trademark purchased in the Hard Rock
acquisition (the  Drill-N-Ream Collateral ). If we do not have the funds necessary to make the future payments under
the Hard Rock Note and fail to make any payments as required thereunder, and we are unsuccessful in amending or restructuring the
payment terms, the holder of the Hard Rock Note could conduct a foreclosure sale on the Drill-N-Ream Collateral in order to apply
the proceeds thereof toward repayment of the Hard Rock Note and all foreclosure costs, and our subsidiary Superior Drilling Solutions,
LLC would be liable for any shortfall or receive any excess from the sales proceeds. The failure to retain and use the Drill-N-Ream
Collateral in our business could cause a significant loss of our investment and might have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operation, as well as our ability to grow our drill string tool business. 

Our level of indebtedness could adversely
affect our future ability to raise additional capital to fund growth, limit our ability to react to changes in our business or
our industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage.   

As noted above, we are required to make payments on the Hard Rock Note of $1.5 million (plus accrued interest)
on before October 15, 2016 ($1.0 million of which was paid through the issuance of 700,000 shares of common stock on August 10,
2016 in connection with the amendment and restatement of the Hard Rock Note and the $500,000 was paid with cash), accrued interest
only in 2017, $2.0 million (plus accrued interest) in 2018 and $4.0 million (plus accrued interest) for 2019, with the balance
due on maturity in January 2020. Interest will continue to accrue on the Hard Rock Note based on the $1,000,000 value of the shares
of common stock until such shares are registered.    In addition, we are required to make
monthly payments of approximately $135,000 on our other indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016, we were not in compliance with
all financial covenants under the FNCC facility and we were in forbearance, however on October 5, 2016 this indebtedness was paid
off in full. 

Our level of debt and
debt service requirements could have important consequences. For example, it could (i) result in a foreclosure upon our key assets,
(ii) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, (iii) limit our ability to fund future capital
expenditures and working capital, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value
of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
payments on our debt, (iv) increase our cost of borrowing, (v) restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to
make non-strategic divestitures, (vi) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry
in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors who are less leveraged and (vii) impair
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
