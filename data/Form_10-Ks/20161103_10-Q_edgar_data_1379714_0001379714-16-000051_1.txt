NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of SPLNG have been prepared in accordance with   GAAP   for interim financial information and with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by   GAAP   for complete financial statements.  In our opinion, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation, have been included.  Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior period information to the current presentation.  The reclassifications had no effect on our overall consolidated financial position, operating results or cash flows.  
    
  In 2016, we renamed our  revenues  line item as  regasification revenues , which include both LNG regasification capacity reservation fees that are received pursuant to our TUAs and tug services fees that are received by Tug Services, our wholly owned subsidiary.  
    
  Results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that will be realized for the year ending December 31,   2016  .  
    
  We are a disregarded entity for federal and state income tax purposes.  Our taxable income or loss, which may vary substantially from the net income or loss reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income, is able to be included in the federal income tax return of Cheniere Partners, a publicly traded partnership which indirectly owns us.  Accordingly, no provision or liability for federal or state income taxes is included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

NOTE 2 RESTRICTED CASH 
    
  Restricted cash consists of funds that are contractually restricted as to usage or withdrawal and have been presented separately from cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands):  

Under the indentures governing our senior notes   (the  Senior Notes Indentures )  , except for permitted tax distributions, we may not make distributions until certain conditions are satisfied, including: (1) there must be on deposit in an interest payment account an amount equal to   one  -sixth of the semi-annual interest payment multiplied by the number of elapsed months since the last semi-annual interest payment, and (2) there must be on deposit in a permanent debt service reserve fund an amount equal to   one   semi-annual interest payment.  Distributions are permitted only after satisfying the foregoing funding requirements, a fixed charge coverage ratio test of   2  :1 and other conditions specified in the   Senior Notes Indentures  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we made distributions of   $230.4 million   and   $267.9 million  , respectively, after satisfying all the applicable conditions in the   Senior Notes Indentures  .

NOTE 6 DEBT 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our debt consisted of the following (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Must be redeemed or repaid concurrently with the   2016 Senior Notes   under the terms of the credit facilities that Cheniere Partners entered into during February 2016   (the  2016 CQP Credit Facilities )   if the obligations under the 2016 Senior Notes are satisfied with borrowings under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  .  See    Note 10 Subsequent Events    for additional details about the redemption of the   2020 Senior Notes  . 
              (2) 
    Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, which require debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, rather than as an asset, retrospectively for each reporting period presented.  As a result, we reclassified   $5.6 million   and   $2.8 million   from debt issuance costs, net to long-term debt, net and current debt, net, respectively, as of   December 31, 2015  . 
              (3) 
    Matures on November 30, 2016.  We currently anticipate that we will satisfy this obligation with capital contributions from Cheniere Partners, which it will fund with borrowings under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  .  See    Note 10 Subsequent Events    for additional details about the intended repayment of the   2016 Senior Notes  .

  The following table (in thousands) shows the carrying amount and estimated fair value of our long-term debt: 

(1) 
    Includes   2016 Senior Notes  , net of discount, and   2020 Senior Notes     (collectively, the  Senior Notes )  .  The Level 2 estimated fair value was based on quotes obtained from broker-dealers or market makers of the   Senior Notes   and other similar instruments.

NOTE 7 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  Below is a summary of our related party transactions as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (in thousands): 

Terminal Use Agreements 
    
  SPL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheniere Partners, obtained approximately   2.0     Bcf/d   of regasification capacity under a   TUA   with us as a result of an assignment in July 2012 by Cheniere Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheniere Partners, of its rights, title and interest under its   TUA   with us.  SPL is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to us aggregating approximately   $250 million   per year   (the  TUA Fees )  , continuing until at least   20 years   after SPL delivers its first commercial cargo at SPL s facilities under construction.    We entered into the   TURA   with   SPL   and Cheniere Investments pursuant to which Cheniere Investments has the right to use   SPL   s reserved capacity under the   TUA   and has the obligation to pay the   TUA Fees   required by the   TUA   to us.  Cheniere Investments  right to use capacity at our LNG terminal will be reduced as each of   Train  s 1 through 4 reaches commercial operations.  The percentage of the   TUA Fees   payable by Cheniere Investments will be reduced from   100%   to   zero   (unless Cheniere Investments utilizes terminal use capacity after Train 4 reaches commercial operations), and the percentage of the   TUA Fees   payable by   SPL   will increase by the amount that Cheniere Investments  percentage decreases.  In May 2016, Cheniere Investments  percentage of all   TUA Fees   payable to us was reduced from   100%   to   75%   and SPL s percentage of all   TUA Fees   payable to us was increased from   zero   to   25%   in accordance with the   TURA  .    Subsequently, in September 2016, Cheniere Investments  percentage of all   TUA Fees   payable to us was further reduced from   75%   to   50%   and SPL s percentage of all   TUA Fees   payable to us was further increased from   25%   to   50%   in accordance with the   TURA  .    Cheniere Partners has guaranteed SPL s obligations under the   TUA   and the obligations of Cheniere Investments under the   TURA  .  In addition, under the   TURA  , SPL is required to pay us cargo loading fees for the LNG vessels that they load at our LNG terminal.  
    
  Services Agreements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $5.9 million   and   $7.2 million  , respectively, of advances to affiliates under the services agreements described below.  The non-reimbursement amounts incurred under the services agreements described below are recorded in general and administrative expense affiliate.

SABINE PASS LNG, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARY 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
  (unaudited) 

We have entered into a long-term operation and maintenance agreement   (the  O M Agreement )   with Cheniere Investments pursuant to which we receive all necessary services required to operate and maintain our LNG receiving terminal.  We incur a fixed monthly fee of   $130,000   (indexed for inflation) under the   O M Agreement  , and the cost of a bonus equal to   50%   of the salary component of labor costs in certain circumstances to be agreed upon between the parties at the beginning of each operating year.  In addition, we incur costs to reimburse Cheniere Investments for its operating expenses, which consist primarily of labor expenses.  
     
  We have entered into a long-term management services agreement   (the  MSA )   with Cheniere Terminals, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheniere, pursuant to which Cheniere Terminals manages the operation of our LNG receiving terminal, excluding those matters provided for under the   O M Agreement  .  We incur a monthly fixed fee of   $520,000   (indexed for inflation) under the   MSA  . 
    
  Cheniere Investments has entered into an information technology services agreement with Cheniere, pursuant to which Cheniere Investment s subsidiaries, including us, receive certain information technology services.  On a quarterly basis, the various entities receiving the benefit are invoiced by Cheniere according to the cost allocation percentages set forth in the agreement.  In addition, Cheniere is entitled to reimbursement for all costs incurred by Cheniere that are necessary to perform the services under the agreement.  
    
  Agreement to Fund Our Cooperative Endeavor Agreements   ( CEAs )    
    
  We have executed   CEAs   with various Cameron Parish, Louisiana taxing authorities that allowed them to collect certain annual property tax payments from 2007 through 2016.  This   10  -year initiative represented an aggregate commitment of   $24.5 million   in order to aid in their reconstruction efforts following Hurricane Rita, which we fulfilled our obligations in the first quarter of 2016.  In exchange for our advance payments of annual ad valorem taxes, Cameron Parish will grant us a dollar-for-dollar credit against future ad valorem taxes to be levied against our LNG terminal starting in 2019.  Beginning in September 2007, we entered into various agreements with Cheniere Marketing, pursuant to which Cheniere Marketing would pay us additional   TUA   revenues equal to any and all amounts payable by us to the Cameron Parish taxing authorities under the   CEAs  .  In exchange for such amounts received as TUA revenues from Cheniere Marketing, we will make payments to Cheniere Marketing equal to, and in the year the Cameron Parish dollar-for-dollar credit is applied against, ad valorem tax levied on our LNG terminal. 
    
  These advance tax payments were recorded to other non-current assets, and payments from Cheniere Marketing that we utilized to make the ad valorem tax payments were recorded as deferred revenue affiliate.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $24.5 million   and   $22.1 million  , respectively, of both other non-current assets resulting from ad valorem tax payments and non-current deferred revenue affiliate resulting from these payments received from Cheniere Marketing. 
    
  Contracts for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas and LNG 
    
  We are able to sell and purchase natural gas and LNG under agreements with Cheniere Marketing.  Under these agreements, we purchase natural gas or LNG from Cheniere Marketing at a sales price equal to the actual purchase price paid by Cheniere Marketing to suppliers of the natural gas or LNG, plus any third-party costs incurred by Cheniere Marketing with respect to the receipt, purchase and delivery of the natural gas or LNG to our LNG terminal.  We are also able to sell and purchase natural gas and LNG under an agreement with SPL. 
    
  Tug Boat Lease Sharing Agreement 
    
  In connection with our tug boat lease, Tug Services, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a tug sharing agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheniere to provide its LNG cargo vessels with tug boat and marine services at our LNG terminal.

LNG Site Sublease Agreement 
    
  We have entered into agreements with SPL to sublease a portion of the LNG terminal site for its liquefaction project.  The annual sublease payment is   $0.9 million  , which was increased from   $0.5 million   during 2015.  The initial term of the sublease expires on December 31, 2034, with options to renew for multiple   10  -year extensions with similar terms as the initial term.  The annual sublease payment will be adjusted for inflation every   five years   based on a consumer price index, as defined in the sublease agreement.  
    
  LNG Terminal Export Agreement 
    
  We have entered into an LNG Terminal Export Agreement with Cheniere Marketing that provides Cheniere Marketing with the ability to export LNG from our LNG terminal.  We did   no  t record any revenues associated with this agreement during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
    
  Cooperation Agreement 
  We have entered into an agreement   (the  Cooperation Agreement )   with SPL to allow SPL to retain and acquire certain rights to access the property and facilities that we own for the purpose of constructing, modifying and operating SPL s facilities under construction.  In consideration for the access we have given, SPL has agreed to transfer title to us of certain facilities, equipment and modifications, which we are obligated to operate and maintain.  The term of this agreement is consistent with our   TUA   described above.  Under this agreement, SPL conveyed to us   zero   and   $252.8 million   of assets for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   zero   and   $80.5 million   of assets for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  State Tax Sharing Agreement 
    
  We have entered into a state tax sharing agreement with Cheniere.  Under this agreement, Cheniere has agreed to prepare and file all state and local tax returns which we and Cheniere are required to file on a combined basis and to timely pay the combined state and local tax liability.  If Cheniere, in its sole discretion, demands payment, we will pay to Cheniere an amount equal to the state and local tax that we would be required to pay if our state and local tax liability were calculated on a separate company basis.  There have been   no   state and local taxes paid by Cheniere for which Cheniere could have demanded payment from us under this agreement; therefore, Cheniere has not demanded any such payments from us.  The agreement is effective for tax returns due on or after January 1, 2008. 

NOTE 8 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION 
    
  The following table (in thousands) provides supplemental disclosure of cash flow information:  

The balance in property, plant and equipment, net funded with accounts payable and accrued liabilities (including affiliate) was   $0.8 million   and   $0.9 million  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

NOTE 9 RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
    
  The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting standards that had not been adopted by the Company as of   September 30, 2016  :  
                           Standard 
      
    Description 
      
    Expected Date of Adoption 
      
    Effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters 
      ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , and subsequent amendments thereto 

This standard amends existing revenue recognition guidance and requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This guidance may be early adopted beginning January 1, 2017, and may be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.

    Effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters 
      ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810):  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 

These amendments primarily affect asset managers and reporting entities involved with limited partnerships or similar entities, but the analysis is relevant in the evaluation of any reporting organization s requirement to consolidate a legal entity.  This guidance changes (1) the identification of variable interests, (2) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination.  This guidance may be early adopted, and may be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. 
      
    January 1, 2016 
      
    The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements or related disclosures. 
    
      ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   and ASU 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements 
      
    These standards require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset.  Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line of credit arrangements may be presented as an asset and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement.  This guidance may be early adopted, and must be adopted retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. 
      
    January 1, 2016 
      
    Upon adoption of these standards, the balance of debt, net was reduced by the balance of debt issuance costs, net, except for the balance related to line of credit arrangements, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  See    Note 6 Debt     for additional disclosures.

    Recent Accounting Standards 

Overview of Business 
    
  We own and operate an LNG receiving and regasification terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, less than four miles from the Gulf Coast on the Sabine-Neches Waterway   (our  LNG terminal )  .  Our   LNG terminal   includes existing infrastructure of   five LNG storage tanks with capacity of   approximately   16.9   Bcfe  , two   marine berths   that can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4.0   Bcf/d  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $12.5 million   of cash and cash equivalents and   $129.1 million   of current and non-current restricted cash, which is restricted to pay interest on the Senior Notes described below.  
    
  The foregoing funds and cash flows generated from operations are anticipated to be sufficient to fund our operating expenditures and interest requirements for at least the next twelve months.  All of our revenues from external customers and long-lived assets for each of the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   are attributed to or located in the United States. 
    
  TUA   Revenues  
    
  Our   LNG terminal   has operational regasification capacity of approximately 4.0   Bcf/d   and aggregate LNG storage capacity of approximately 16.9   Bcfe  .  Approximately 2.0   Bcf/d   of the regasification capacity at our   LNG terminal   has been reserved under two long-term third-party   TUA  s, under which our customers are required to pay fixed monthly fees, whether or not they use our   LNG terminal  .  Each of Total Gas   Power North America, Inc.   ( Total )   and Chevron U.S.A. Inc.   ( Chevron )   has reserved approximately 1.0   Bcf/d   of regasification capacity and is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to us aggregating approximately $125 million annually for 20 years that commenced in 2009.  Total S.A. has guaranteed   Total   s obligations under its   TUA   up to $2.5 billion, subject to certain exceptions, and Chevron Corporation has guaranteed   Chevron   s obligations under its   TUA   up to 80% of the fees payable by   Chevron  .  
    
  The remaining approximately 2.0   Bcf/d   of capacity has been reserved under a   TUA   by SPL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheniere Partners (NYSE MKT: CQP), a publicly traded partnership which indirectly owns us.  SPL is developing liquefaction facilities at our   LNG terminal   adjacent to our existing regasification facilities in order to liquefy and export natural gas from the United States.  SPL is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to us aggregating approximately $250 million annually   (the  TUA Fees )  , continuing until at least 20 years after SPL delivers its first commercial cargo at SPL s liquefaction facilities under construction at our   LNG terminal  .  We entered into a terminal use rights assignment and agreement   (the  TURA )   with SPL and Cheniere Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheniere Partners,   pursuant to which Cheniere Investments has the right to use   SPL   s reserved capacity under the   TUA   and has the obligation to pay the   TUA Fees   required by the   TUA   to us.  Cheniere Investments  right to use capacity at our LNG terminal will be reduced as each of   Train  s 1 through 4 reaches commercial operations.  The percentage of the   TUA Fees   payable by Cheniere Investments will be reduced from   100%   to   zero   (unless Cheniere Investments utilizes terminal use capacity after Train 4 reaches commercial operations), and the percentage of the   TUA Fees   payable by   SPL   will increase by the amount that Cheniere Investments  percentage decreases.  In May 2016, Cheniere Investments  percentage of all   TUA Fees   payable to us was reduced from 100% to 75% and SPL s percentage of all   TUA Fees   payable to us increased from zero to 25% in accordance with the   TURA  .    Subsequently, in September 2016, upon substantial completion of Train 2 of the   Liquefaction Project  , Cheniere Investments  percentage of all   TUA Fees   payable to us was further reduced from   75%   to   50%   and SPL s percentage of all   TUA Fees   payable to us was further increased from   25%   to   50%   in accordance with the   TURA  .    Cheniere Partners has guaranteed   SPL   s obligations under the   TUA   and the obligations of Cheniere Investments under the   TURA  .    Under each of these   TUA  s, we are entitled to retain 2% of the LNG delivered to our   LNG terminal  .  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold LNG to SPL and recorded other revenues affiliate of   zero   and   $4.1 million  , respectively. 

15 

In   2016  , SPL commenced export of LNG from our LNG terminal, and we provided related cargo loading services.    During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded other revenues affiliate of   $2.1 million   and   $5.6 million  , respectively, related to these services.  
    
  Capital Resources 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion, before discount, of the 7.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2016   (the  2016 Senior Notes )   and $0.4 billion of the 6.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020   (the  2020 Senior Notes  and collectively with the 2016 Senior Notes, the  Senior Notes )  .  Borrowings under the   2016 Senior Notes   and   2020 Senior Notes   accrue interest at a fixed rate of 7.50% and 6.50%, respectively.  The terms of the   2016 Senior Notes   and   2020 Senior Notes   are substantially similar.  Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears.  Subject to permitted liens, the Senior Notes are secured on a   pari passu   first-priority basis by a security interest in all of our equity interests and substantially all of our operating assets. 
    
  We may redeem all or part of our   2016 Senior Notes   at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of:  
     1.0% of the principal amount of the   2016 Senior Notes  ; or  
             
    the excess of: (1) the present value at such redemption date of (a) the redemption price of the   2016 Senior Notes   plus (b) all required interest payments due on the   2016 Senior Notes   (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over (2) the principal amount of the   2016 Senior Notes   if greater. 
       
   We may redeem all or part of the   2020 Senior Notes   at any time on or after November 1, 2016, at fixed redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the   2020 Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.  
    
  Under the indentures governing the   Senior Notes     (the  Senior Notes Indentures )  , except for permitted tax distributions, we may not make distributions until certain conditions are satisfied, including: (1) there must be on deposit in an interest payment account an amount equal to one-sixth of the semi-annual interest payment multiplied by the number of elapsed months since the last semi-annual interest payment, and (2) there must be on deposit in a permanent debt service reserve fund an amount equal to one semi-annual interest payment.  Distributions are permitted only after satisfying the foregoing funding requirements, a fixed charge coverage ratio test of 2:1 and other conditions specified in the   Senior Notes Indentures  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we made distributions of   $230.4 million   and   $267.9 million  , respectively, after satisfying all the applicable conditions in the   Senior Notes Indentures  . 
    
  On October 14, 2016, we issued a notice of redemption to redeem all of our outstanding   2020 Senior Notes  .  The redemption date will be November 30, 2016 (the  Redemption Date ) and the price will be equal to 103.250% of the principal amount of the   2020 Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the   2020 Senior Notes   to, but not including, the Redemption Date.  Concurrently with the redemption of the   2020 Senior Notes  , we intend to repay all of our outstanding   2016 Senior Notes  , which mature on the Redemption Date, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the   2016 Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the   2016 Senior Notes   to, but not including, the Redemption Date.  The redemption of the   2020 Senior Notes   and the repayment of the   2016 Senior Notes   will be funded with borrowings under the Credit and Guaranty Agreement aggregating $2.8 billion that Cheniere Partners entered into in February 2016.  

16 

Sources and Uses of Cash  
    
  The following table (in thousands) summarizes the sources and uses of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures, including accruals, which are referred to elsewhere in this report.  Additional discussion of these items follows the table. 

Operating Cash Flows 
    
  Operating cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $281.6 million   and   $257.9 million  , respectively.  Operating cash flow related primarily to fixed monthly fees paid by our   TUA   customers, which in 2015 was offset by an amount paid to purchase LNG cargoes used to maintain cryogenic readiness of our LNG terminal, which was not incurred in 2016.  This purchase was funded by capital contributions from Cheniere Partners in 2015, but our TUA customers were obligated to fully reimburse us for their proportional share of the cost of these LNG cargoes. 
    
  Investing Cash Flows 
    
  Investing cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $8.3 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we used   $4.5 million   primarily for payments made pursuant to the information technology services agreement for capital assets purchased on our behalf.  The remaining   $3.8 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, were used to purchase property, plant and equipment. 
    
  Financing Cash Flows 
    
  Financing cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $230.4 million   and   $215.5 million  , respectively, as a result of distributions to our limited partner.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the distributions of   $267.9 million   to our limited partner were offset by capital contributions received from Cheniere Partners of   $52.4 million  .  

Results of Operations 
    
  There were no significant changes in our revenues or operating costs and expenses in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the respective periods in 2015, except for   $2.1 million   and   $9.8 million   of other affiliated revenues for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The other affiliated revenues for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   included   $2.1 million   and   $5.6 million  , respectively, for cargo loading services for SPL and   zero   and   $4.1 million  , respectively, for sales of LNG to SPL.  We expect further increases in our revenues and operating costs and expenses as SPL continues production at its liquefaction facilities adjacent to our existing regasification facilities.  Additional revenues will primarily consist of cargo loading and tug services fees that will be partially offset by additional operating costs and expenses related to these activities.  

17 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no transactions that met the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial position or operating results.  

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with   GAAP   requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes.  There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .
