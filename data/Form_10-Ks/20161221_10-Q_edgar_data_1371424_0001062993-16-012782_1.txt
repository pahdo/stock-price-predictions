      SIGNIFICANT POLICIES   

Basis of Presentation    The accompanying financial
      statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States of America. Royal Mines and
      Minerals Corp s (the  Company ) fiscal year-end is April 30.  

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been
      prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of
      Regulation S-X, and, therefore, do not include all information and
      footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position,
      results of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' deficit in conformity
      with generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of
      management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation
      of the results of operations and financial position have been included and
      all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Operating results
      for the six months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
      of the results that can be expected for the year ending April 30,
      2017.  

Description of Business    The Company's primary
      objectives are to 1) commercially and viably extract and refine precious
      metals from specific coal ash (fly and bottom), ores and other leachable
      assets, 2) use its proprietary processes to convert specific ore bodies
      and coal ash landfills into valuable assets, and 3) joint venture, acquire
      and develop mining projects in North America. The Company has not yet
      realized significant revenues from its primary objectives.  

History    The Company was incorporated on December
      14, 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On June 13, 2007, the
      Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Royal Mines Acquisition
      Corp., in the state of Nevada.  

On October 5, 2007, Centrus Ventures Inc. (Centrus)
      completed the acquisition of Royal Mines Inc. ( Royal Mines ). The
      acquisition of Royal Mines was completed by way of a  triangular merger 
      pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
      September 24, 2007 (the  First Merger Agreement ) among Centrus, Royal
      Mines Acquisition Corp. ( Centrus Sub ), a wholly owned subsidiary of
      Centrus, Royal Mines and Kevin B. Epp, the former sole executive officer
      and director of Centrus. On October 5, 2007, under the terms of the First
      Merger Agreement, Royal Mines was merged with and into Centrus Sub, with
      Centrus Sub continuing as the surviving corporation (the  First
      Merger ).  

On October 6, 2007, a second merger was completed
      pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October 6, 2007 (the
       Second Merger Agreement ) between Centrus and its wholly owned
      subsidiary, Centrus Sub, whereby Centrus Sub was merged with and into
      Centrus, with Centrus continuing as the surviving corporation (the  Second
      Merger ). As part of the Second Merger, Centrus changed its name from
       Centrus Ventures Inc.  to  Royal Mines And Minerals Corp. ( the
      Company ). Other than the name change, no amendments were made to the
      Articles of Incorporation.  

Under the terms and conditions of the First Merger
      Agreement, each share of Royal Mines  common stock issued and outstanding
      immediately prior to the completion of the First Merger was converted into
      one share of Centrus  common stock. As a result, a total of 32,183,326
      shares of Centrus common stock were issued to former stockholders of Royal
      Mines. In addition, Mr. Epp surrendered 23,500,000 shares of Centrus
      common stock for cancellation in consideration of payment by Centrus of
      $0.001 per share for an aggregate consideration of $23,500. As a result,
      upon completion of the First Merger, the former stockholders of Royal
      Mines owned approximately 69.7% of the issued and outstanding common
      stock.  

As such, Royal Mines is deemed to be the acquiring
      enterprise for financial reporting purposes. All acquired assets and
      liabilities of Centrus were recorded at fair value on the date of the
      acquisition, as required by the purchase method of accounting, and the
      tangible net liabilities were debited against equity of the Company. There
      are no continuing operations of Centrus from the date of
      acquisition.

ROYAL MINES AND MINERALS CORP.  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL
  STATEMENTS  
  OCTOBER 31, 2016  
  (UNAUDITED)  
 
  Going Concern    The accompanying
  financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with
  accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S.
  GAAP ). The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will
  continue in operation for the next twelve months and will be able to realize its
  assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of
  business and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
  effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
  classification of liabilities that may result from the Company s inability to
  continue as a going concern. The Company s history of losses, working capital
  deficit, capital deficit, minimal liquidity and other factors raise substantial
  doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In order for
  the Company to continue operations beyond the next twelve months and be able to
  discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business it
  must raise additional equity or debt capital and continue cost cutting measures.
  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve sustainable
  profitable operations or obtain additional funds when needed or that such funds,
  if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to management. 
 If the Company continues to incur
  operating losses and does not raise sufficient additional capital, material
  adverse events may occur including, but not limited to, 1) a reduction in the
  nature and scope of the Company s operations and 2) the Company s inability to
  fully implement its current business plan. There can be no assurance that the
  Company will successfully improve its liquidity position. The accompanying
  financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might be required
  resulting from the adverse outcome relating to this uncertainty.  
 As of October 31, 2016, the Company had
  cumulative net losses of $19,209,725 from operations since inception and had
  negative working capital of $2,446,264. For the six months ended October 31,
  2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $655,378 and had net cash used in
  operating activities of $276,605. For the six months ended October 31, 2015 the
  Company incurred a net loss of $391,575 and had net cash used in operating
  activities of $255,774. The Company has not fully started its minerals
  processing operations, raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue
  as a going concern. 
 To address liquidity constraints, the
  Company will seek additional sources of capital through the issuance of equity
  or debt financing. Additionally, the Company has reduced expenses, elected to
  defer payment of certain obligations, deferred payment of our CEO s salary and
  reduced staffing levels to conserve cash. The Company is focused on continuing
  to reduce costs and obtaining additional funding. There is no assurance that
  such funding will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If
  the Company raises additional funds by selling additional shares of capital
  stock, securities convertible into shares of capital stock, or by issuing debt
  convertible into shares of capital stock, the ownership interest of the
  Company s existing common stock holders will be diluted.  
  Use of Estimates  - The
  preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
  management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
  assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
  the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
  expenses during the reporting period. By their nature, these estimates are
  subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on the financial statements of
  changes in such estimates in future periods could be significant. Significant
  areas requiring management s estimates and assumptions include the valuation of
  stock-based compensation, impairment analysis of long-lived assets, and the
  realizability of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those
  estimates.  
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  - The
  Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or
  less to be a cash equivalent. 
  Other Current Assets  - Other
  current assets are comprised of other receivables, which do not bear interest
  and are recorded at cost. The Company extends credit to its consultants, which
  receivables can be offset against commissions payable to the respective
  consultants.

  OCTOBER 31, 2016  
  (UNAUDITED)  
 
 The allowance for doubtful accounts
  represents the Company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses
  in the Company s existing other receivables. The Company determines the
  allowance based on specific customer information, historical write-off
  experience and current industry and economic data. Account balances are charged
  off against the allowance when the Company believes it is probable the
  receivable will not be recovered. Management believes that there are no
  concentrations of credit risk for which an allowance has not been established.
  Although management believes that the allowance is adequate, it is possible that
  the estimated amount of cash collections with respect to accounts receivable
  could change. As of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, the Company has
  recorded an allowance for doubtful account of $15,798. 
  Fair Value  -   ASC 825,
  Financial Instruments requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
  inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
  ASC 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent,
  objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A
  financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based
  upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
  measurement. ASC 825 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used
  to measure fair value:  
 Level 1  
 Level 1 applies to assets or
  liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical
  assets or liabilities.  
 Level 2  
 Level 2 applies to assets or
  liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are
  observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets
  or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or
  liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less
  active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are
  observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable
  market data of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
 Level 3  
 Level 3 applies to assets or
  liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology
  that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or
  liabilities.  
 Pursuant to ASC 825, the fair value of
  cash is determined based on  Level 1  inputs, which consist of quoted prices in
  active markets for identical assets. The Company's financial instruments consist
  of cash, prepaid expenses, other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities,
  and loans payable. The carrying amount of these financial instruments
  approximates fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that
  approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these
  financial statements.  
 Assets measured at fair value on a
  recurring basis were presented on the Company s balance sheet as of October 31,
  2016 and April 30, 2016 as follows:

  STATEMENTS  
  OCTOBER 31, 2016  
  (UNAUDITED)  
 
  Fair Value Measurements at April 30, 2016 Using:   
 
  Property and Equipment  -
  Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
  Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the
  estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally 3 to 10 years. The
  cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures
  for property betterments and renewals are capitalized. Upon sale or other
  disposition of a depreciable asset, cost and accumulated depreciation are
  removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operating
  expenses.  
  Mineral Exploration and Development
  Costs    Exploration expenditures incurred prior to entering the development
  stage are expensed and included in mineral exploration and evaluation expense.  
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets    The Company reviews and evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events
  or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be
  recoverable. The assets are subject to impairment consideration under ASC
  360-10-35-17,  Measurement of an Impairment Loss , if events or
  circumstances indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable. 
 Various factors could impact our
  ability to achieve forecasted production schedules. Additionally, commodity
  prices, capital expenditure requirements and reclamation costs could differ from
  the assumptions the Company may use in cash flow models used to assess
  impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable
  minerals from mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those
  factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have
  been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified
  mineralized material can ultimately be mined economically. 
 The Company's policy is to record an
  impairment loss in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of
  the asset may not be recoverable either by impairment or by abandonment of the
  property. The impairment loss is calculated as the amount by which the carrying
  amount of the assets exceeds its fair value. No impairment expense was
  recognized for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. 
  Research and Development  - All
  research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.  
  Per Share Amounts  - Basic
  earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
  weighted average number of common shares outstanding. In computing diluted
  earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares outstanding is
  adjusted to reflect the effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially
  dilutive shares, such as stock options and warrants, are excluded from the
  calculation when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, such as when the
  exercise price of the instrument exceeds the fair market value of the Company s
  common stock and when a net loss is reported. The dilutive effect of convertible
  debt securities is reflected in the diluted earnings (loss) per share
  calculation using the if-converted method. Conversion of the debt securities is
  not assumed for purposes of calculating diluted earnings (loss) per share if the
  effect is anti-dilutive. As of October 31, 2016, and 2015, stock options and
  warrants outstanding were 163,825,129 and 159,785,129 respectively, but were not
  considered in the computation of diluted earnings per share as their inclusion
  would be anti-dilutive.  
  Income Taxes    For interim
  reporting periods, the Company uses the annualized effective tax rate ( AETR )
  method to calculate its income tax provision. Under this method, the AETR is
  applied to the interim year-to-date pre-tax losses to determine the
  income tax benefit or expense for the year-to-date period. The income tax
  benefit or expense for a quarter represents the difference between the
  year-to-date income tax benefit or expense for the current year-to-date period
  less such amount for the immediately preceding year-to-date period. Management
  considers the impact of all known events in its estimation of the Company s
  annual operating results and AETR.

ROYAL MINES AND MINERALS CORP.  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL
  STATEMENTS  
  OCTOBER 31, 2016  
  (UNAUDITED)  
 
 The Company follows the liability
  method of accounting for income taxes. This method recognizes certain temporary
  differences between the financial reporting basis of liabilities and assets and
  the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method
  generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset as measured by the
  statutory tax rates in effect. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized
  in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company
  records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax
  assets when it believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more
  likely than not that some portion or all the deferred income tax asset will not
  be realized.  
  Stock-Based Compensation    The
  Company accounts for share based payments in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation - Stock Compensation , which requires all share-based
  payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
  recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the
  award. In accordance with ASC 718-10-30-9,  Measurement Objective   Fair Value
    at Grant Date , the Company estimates the fair value of the award using a
  valuation technique. For this purpose, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option
  pricing model. The Company believes this model provides the best estimate of
  fair value due to its ability to incorporate inputs that change over time, such
  as volatility and interest rates. Compensation cost is recognized over the
  requisite service period which is generally equal to the vesting period. Upon
  exercise, shares issued will be newly issued shares from authorized common
  stock.  
 ASC 505, "Compensation-Stock
  Compensation", establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in
  which an entity exchanges its equity instruments to non-employees for goods or
  services. Under this transition method, stock compensation expense includes
  compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted on or after
  January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
  the provisions of ASC 505.  
  Recent Accounting Standards   
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial
  Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that are adopted by the Company as of the
  specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that
  the impact of recently issued standards did not or will not have a material
  impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows
  upon adoption.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued
  Accounting Standard ( ASU ) 2016-02,  Leases,  which requires lessees to put
  most leases on their balance sheets, but recognize the expenses on their income
  statements in a manner like current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee
  would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and
  a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease
  term. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December
  15, 2018 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted.
  The standard will be effective for the Company beginning May 1, 2019. The
  Company is currently evaluating the impact to its condensed financial
  statements.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU
  2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which simplifies
  income tax accounting. The update requires that all deferred tax assets and
  liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of
  separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. This update is
  effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
  periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption
  of this standard had no impact on the condensed financial position, results of
  operations or cash flows.  
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU
  2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the
  Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which simplifies the presentation of debt
  issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction
  from the corresponding debt liability. The update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods,
  beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption was permitted. The
  adoption of this standard had no impact on the condensed financial
  position, results of operations or cash flows.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure
      of Uncertainties about Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern .
      This standard requires management of public and private companies to
      evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to
      continue as a going concern and, if so, disclose that fact. Management is
      also required to evaluate and disclose whether its plans alleviate that
      doubt. The standard is effective for annual periods ending after December
      15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after
      December 15, 2016. Adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have an
      impact on the condensed financial position, results of operations or cash
      flows.

       SCOTTSDALE FACILITY AGREEMENT   

On April 16, 2014, the Company entered into a loan and
      joint venture agreement (the  Agreement ) with GJS Capital Corp. (the
      "Creditor"). Under the terms of the Agreement, the Creditor loaned the
      Company $150,000 convertible note (the  Principal ) and agreed to form a
      joint venture with the Company for constructing and operating a processing
      plant at the Scottsdale facility, an existing facility, utilizing the
      Company s licensed Technology. In addition, the Creditor was to advance
      $250,000 plus up to 15% for contingencies, a total of $287,500, to fund
      the initial construction and operation costs of the joint venture. The
      advances were not expected to be paid back to the Creditor. The Company
      received a total of $329,000 towards the joint venture and treated the
      funds as contributed capital, since in substance the Creditor secured
      future revenue of the Scottsdale facility operations with such
      funds.  

On September 23, 2016, the Company entered into an
      amended and restated loan and joint venture agreement (the  Amendment
      Agreement ) with the Creditor and Gregg Sedun (the  Consultant ). The
      Amendment Agreement replaces in its entirety the Agreement, between the
      Company and the Creditor.  

Under the terms of the Amendment Agreement, the Creditor
      has agreed to extend the Principal. The loan bears interest at a rate of
      6% per annum, compounded annually and now has a maturity date of December
      31, 2016 (the  Maturity Date"). The Company settled the $329,000 joint
      venture advance in exchange for 15,065,570 shares of common stock of the
      Company. Also, the Company agreed to transfer 1,400,000 of its 1,600,000
      common shares of Gainey Capital Corp. to the Creditor.  

At any time prior to the Maturity Date, the Creditor may
      elect to receive units (each a  Unit") of the Company in exchange for any
      portion of the Principal outstanding on the basis of one Unit for each
      $0.05 of indebtedness converted (the  Unit Conversion Option"). Each Unit
      consists of one share of the Company s common stock and one warrant to
      purchase an additional share of the Company's common stock at a price of
      $0.10 per share for two years from the date of issuance. If the Creditor
      exercises the Unit Conversion Option, the Creditor will forgive the
      interest that accrued on the converted portion of the Principal.  

If the Creditor exercises the Unit Conversion Option, the
      Creditor will receive a net profits interest (the  Net Profits Interest )
      on any future profits received by the Company that are derived from the
      Company s Technology on the basis of 1% of the Company s net profits for
      every $10,000 of converted Principal. The Net Profits Interest will
      terminate when the Creditor receives eight times the amount of converted
      Principal.  

The Company also agreed that in circumstances where the
      Consultant introduces sub-licensees or joint venture partners
      ( Partnership Interest ) to the Company for the purpose of using the
      Company s Technology, the Company shall pay 20% of the net cash proceeds
      received by the Company from the Partnership Interest to the Consultant.
      The Company is under no obligation to enter into an agreement or terminate
      any future agreement with any Partnership Interest

       INVESTMENT IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES   

On September 27, 2013, the Company entered into a
      settlement and security release agreement with Golden Anvil. Under the
      terms of the Release Agreement, the Company agreed to release Golden Anvil
      from loan agreements pursuant to which, Golden Anvil owed the Company
      $983,055 in secured indebtedness. In exchange for the release, Golden
      Anvil had 2,000,000 common shares of Gainey issued to the Company as part
      of an asset purchase agreement between Golden Anvil and Gainey.  

The Asset Purchase was completed on September 30, 2013.
      The Gainey shares are held in escrow and will be released pursuant to the
      terms of a surplus escrow agreement as follows. The company cannot enter
      into any sales transaction of the Gainey shares prior to their
      release.  

On March 30, 2015, the Company sold
  400,000 Gainey shares to the Creditor (see Note 2) for $49,747 cash, net of
  currency exchange and other banking fees. The cost of the 400,000 Gainey shares
  was $200,000. The Company recorded a loss on sale of marketable securities of
  $150,253.  
 On September 23, 2016, the Company
  agreed to transfer 1,400,000 Gainey shares to the Creditor in accordance with
  the Amendment Agreement. The cost of the 1,400,000 Gainey shares was $700,000.
  The Company had previously recorded a other than temporary loss on marketable
  securities of $510,433 related to these 1,400,000 Gainey shares. The Company
  recorded a loss on marketable securities in joint venture settlement of $189,567
  and removed an unrealized gain on marketable securities of $3,717.  
 On October 14, 2016, the Company sold
  its last 200,000 Gainey shares to the Creditor for $40,280 cash. The cost of the
  200,000 Gainey shares was $100,000. The Company had previously recorded a other
  than temporary loss on marketable securities of $72,919 related to these 200,000
  Gainey shares. The Company recorded a gain on sale of marketable securities of
  $13,199 and removed an unrealized gain on marketable securities of $531.  
 As of October 31, 2016 and April 30,
  2016, investment in marketable securities consisted of zero and $216,648,
  respectively. The Company held 1,600,000 Gainey Capital Corp. ( Gainey ) common
  shares, and the market value was $0.135 per share April 30, 2016. Gainey shares
  are traded on the Vancouver exchange under the stock symbol GNC.V and on the OTC
  Pink marketplace under the stock symbol GNYPF. Marketable securities are held
  for an indefinite period of time and thus are classified as available-for-sale
  securities. Realized investment gains and losses are included in the statement
  of operations, as are provisions for other than temporary declines in the market
  value of available-for-sale securities. Unrealized gains and unrealized losses
  deemed to be temporary are excluded from earnings (losses), net of applicable
  taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income. Factors considered in
  judging whether an impairment is other than temporary include the financial
  condition, business prospects and creditworthiness of the issuer, the length of
  time that fair value has been less than cost, the relative amount of decline,
  and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value
  recovers.  
 Based on management s evaluation of the
  circumstances, management believed that the decline in fair value below the cost
  of certain of the Company s marketable securities was other-than-temporary.  
 The following is a summary of
  available-for-sale marketable securities as of April 30, 2016:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.   
  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
  
 Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report
constitute "forward-looking statements.  These statements, identified by words
such as  plan,  "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "should," "expect" and
similar expressions include our expectations and objectives regarding our future
financial position, operating results and business strategy. These statements
reflect the current views of management with respect to future events and are
subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual
results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially
different from those described in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and
uncertainties include those set forth under the caption "Part II   Item 1A. Risk
Factors" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. We do not intend to update the
forward-looking information to reflect actual results or changes in the factors
affecting such forward-looking information. We advise you to carefully review
the reports and documents, particularly our Annual Reports, Quarterly Reports
and Current Reports, that we file from time to time with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  
  OVERVIEW   
 We were incorporated on December 14, 2005 under the laws of the
State of Nevada. Our primary objectives are to: (i) commercially and viably
extract and refine precious metals from specific coal (fly and bottom) ash and
other leachable assets; (ii) use our proprietary processes to convert specific
ore bodies and coal ash landfills into valuable assets; and (iii) joint venture,
acquire and develop mining projects in North America.  
 We are focusing our business on commercially processing
specific coal ash through a process of mechanical attrition, chemical treatments
and thermal sintering that exposes extractable gold (the  Cholla Process ) at
our processing and refining plant located in Scottsdale, Arizona (the
 Scottsdale Facility ). This process agglomerates metal atoms into larger
nanoparticles, before forming bulk gold metal. Once in bulk gold metal, all
traditional assay methods can effectively measure value. In November 2012, we
shut down our Phoenix Facility and we have no plans to continue that operation.
 
 We are actively seeking to enter into joint ventures with third
parties who have legal rights to fly ash resources, including landfills. There
is no assurance that we will be able to commercially extract precious metals
from fly ash or other mineable ores using our Cholla process or that we will be
able to enter into joint ventures for the exploration and development of
additional mining projects.  
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
  Three Months and Six Months Summary   

Revenues   
 We earned no revenues during the six months ended October 31,
2016 and 2015. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to develop a
commercially viable process or earn significant revenue from the processing of
fly ash or other materials.

Expenses   
 The major components of our operating expenses for the three
and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 are outlined in the table below:

Our operating expenses for the three and six months ended
October 31, 2016 increased as compared to the three and six months ended October
31, 2015. The increase in our operating expenses primarily relates to the
recording of losses in connection with our entry into a joint venture settlement
agreement and the sale of securities in connection with that settlement. The
increase was partially offset by decreases in mineral exploration and evaluation
expenses and a gain on sale of marketable securities. 
 Mineral exploration and evaluation expenses primarily consist
of rent, consulting fees and labor expenses in connection with our Scottsdale
Facility. 
 Loss in marketable securities on joint venture settlement and
loss on joint venture settlement relates to our entry into an amended and
restated loan and joint venture agreement (the  Amendment Agreement ) with GJS
Capital Corp. (the "Creditor") and Gregg Sedun (the  Consultant ). The Amendment
Agreement replaces in its entirety the original loan and joint venture agreement
(the  Original Agreement ) dated April 16, 2014, between the Creditor and us.
Under the terms of the Amendment Agreement, the Creditor has agreed to extend
the previously advanced $150,000 Convertible Loan (the  Principal ). The loan
bears interest at a rate of 6% per annum, compounded annually and now has a
maturity date of December 31, 2016 (the  Maturity Date"). We settled $329,000 in
joint venture contributed capital in exchange for 15,065,570 shares of our
common stock. Also, we transferred, 1,400,000 of our 1,600,000 common shares of
Gainey Capital Corp. to the Creditor. The Creditor represented that it was not a
"US Person" as that term is defined by Regulation S of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.  
 Other than temporary loss on sale of marketable securities
relates to the impairment loss recognized for the continued decline in stock
price of our Gainey Capital Corp. shares.  
 Our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of:
(i) monthly consulting fees to our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Mitchell; (ii)
legal and audit fees in connection with meeting our reporting requirements under
the Exchange Act; and (iii) travel expense for our executives and directors. 
 5 

We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase
significantly as we implement our plan of operation for our Scottsdale Facility.
 
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

As of October 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of
$2,446,264 as compared to a working capital deficit of $2,206,781 at our year
ended April 30, 2016. The increase in our working capital deficit is primarily
due to an increase in accrued interest-related parties and loans payable-related
parties.  
  FINANCING REQUIREMENTS  
 Currently, we do not have sufficient financial resources to
complete our plan of operation for the next twelve months. As such, our ability
to complete our plan of operation is dependent upon our ability to obtain
additional financing in the near term. 
 We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common
shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of
additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is
no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities
or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned mining, development
and exploration activities.  
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is
material to stockholders.  
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
 We have identified certain accounting policies, described
below, that are most important to the portrayal of our current financial
condition and results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are
disclosed in Note 1 to our interim financial statements included in this
Quarterly Report.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) as of October 31, 2016 (the  Evaluation Date ). This evaluation
was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date.
 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
  
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2016 that
have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   
  ITEM
1.              
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   
 The Company received a verified complaint (the  Complaint ),
dated September 12, 2013, that was filed in Arizona Superior Court, Maricopa
County, by McKendry Enterprises, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan and Retirement Trust
(the  Landlord ), alleging breach of contract and breach of covenant of good
faith and fair dealing in relation to the lease agreement dated June 6, 2007,
between the Landlord and the Company, as amended (the  Lease Agreement ). The
Complaint sought to recover damages of at least $108,581, including, but not
limited to: 1) $56,358 rent; 2) $52,223 for maintenance, clean-up costs and
construction; and 3) undetermined damages for additional repair, clean up and
legal fees.  
 On October 22, 2014, the Company reached a settlement with the
Landlord to pay $70,000 as follows: $5,000 on or before November 24, 2014
(amount has been paid); $5,000 payable 90 days thereafter (amount has been
paid); six payments of $7,000 due every 90 days thereafter (five payments of
$7,000 have been paid); and two $9,000 payments due every 90 days thereafter.
Each payment has a 3-day cure/grace period. Any later payment will trigger a
default and immediate recordation/enforcement of a judgment. Payment is secured
by a judgment for $78,969 plus attorney fees incurred by Landlord to date, plus
any further attorney fees incurred in relation to the judgment. The judgment
will not be executed unless the Company defaults on its payment obligations
noted above. As of July 31, 2016, the Company has a liability in the amount of
$25,000 recorded in accounts payable related to this matter.  
 On May 1, 2015, the Company received an amended Notice of Civil
Claim (the  Claim ), dated April 1, 2015 (original filed on December 31, 2014),
that was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, by 1254859 Ontario Inc.
(the  Plaintiff ), alleging breach of specific performance and breach of
contract in relation to the Golden Anvil Asset Purchase by Gainey (see Note 3).
The Plaintiff seeks to recover damages of including, but not limited to: 1)
1,000,000 shares of Gainey stock; 2) damages in lieu of specific performance;
and 3) damages for breach of contract.  
 On June 1, 2015, the Company filed a Response to Civil Claim,
denying: 1) entering into any oral agreement; 2) that the Plaintiff presented a
potential transaction with Gainey; 3) that there was any fee payable to
Plaintiff upon completion of a transaction with Gainey; 4) any existence of an
agreement with Plaintiff and as such, the Gainey transaction was not related to
any agreement with Plaintiff; and 5) any obligation to pay a fee to Plaintiff,
contractually or otherwise. While the Company intends to vigorously defend the
lawsuit, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully
defend the lawsuit.  
 On January 29, 2016, the Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Application (the  Injunction Application ) in the Supreme Court of British
Columbia, seeking an injunction to prohibit the distribution of shares of Gainey
Capital Corp. held by the Company. A hearing took place on March 17, 2016. The
Company successfully opposed the Injunction Application and on June 16, 2016 the
Injunction Application was dismissed against the Company.  
  ITEM
1A.             RISK
FACTORS.   
 The following are some of the important factors that could
affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ
materially from estimates contained in our forward-looking statements. We may
encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be
immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operation.  
  If we do not obtain additional financing, we may not be able
to continue our operations at our Scottsdale Facility or enter into any
potential joint venture or licensing agreements.   
 As of October 31, 2016, we had cash on hand of $20,735 and
accumulated net loss of $19,209,725 since inception. Our plan of operation calls
for significant expenses in connection with the operation of our Scottsdale
Facility and the entry of any potential joint ventures. If we are unable to
raise sufficient financing, there is a substantial risk that we will be unable
to meet payments of principal and interest to our creditors and pay our
consultants and employees. In addition, we will require substantial financing in
order to implement our plan of operation over the next twelve months.
There is no assurance that this will satisfy all of our working capital
requirements for the next twelve months or that these funds will be sufficient
to complete our planned development program. 
 8 

Because we are a development stage company, we face a high
risk of business failure.   
 We have earned minimal revenues from the processing of ore at
our Phoenix and Scottsdale Facilities. Our primary business activities have
involved the exploration and development on the Piute Valley Property and the
commencement of operations at our Phoenix Facility and Scottsdale Facility. In
August 2012, we did not pay the renewal fee on the Piute Valley Property and the
BLM Claims, allowing those claims to lapse. In November 2012, we shut down our
Phoenix Facility and we have no plans to continue that operation. Potential
investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by
exploration and development stage companies and the high rate of failure of such
enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the
problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in
connection with the exploration of mineral properties. These potential problems
include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration,
and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates.  
  Because we anticipate our operating expenses will increase
prior to our earning significant revenues, we may never achieve profitability.
  
 We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses
prior to realizing any significant revenues. We therefore expect to incur
significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if we are
unable to generate significant revenues from the operation of our Scottsdale
Facility, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is
no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will
prove successful, and we may not be able to ever generate any operating revenues
or achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these
risks, our business will most likely fail.  
  Certain work to be performed at our facility may require us
to apply for permits from federal, state or local regulatory bodies.   
 If our applications for permits from the relevant regulatory
bodies are denied, we may not be able to proceed with our development programs
as disclosed above, which could have a negative effect on our business. 
  If we are unable to hire and retain key personnel, we may
not be able to implement our business plan and our business will fail.  
 Our success will largely depend on our ability to hire highly
qualified personnel with experience in the geological field. These individuals
may be in high demand and we may not be able to attract the staff we need. In
addition, we may not be able to afford the high salaries and fees demanded by
qualified personnel, or may lose such employees after they are hired. Our
failure to hire key personnel when needed could have a significant negative
effect on our business.  
  If we complete additional financings through the sale of
shares of our common stock, our existing stockholders will experience dilution.
  
 The most likely source of future financing presently available
to us is through the issuance of our common stock. Issuing shares of our common
stock, for financing purposes or otherwise, will dilute the interests of our
existing stockholders. 
  Because our stock is a penny stock, stockholders will be
more limited in their ability to sell their stock.   
 Our common stock is considered to be a  penny stock  since it
does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of  penny stock 
under Section 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. Our common stock is a  penny stock 
because it meets one or more of the following conditions (i) the stock trades at
a price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is not traded on a  recognized 
national exchange; (iii) it is not quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market, or even if so, has a price less than $5.00 per
share; or (iv) is issued by a company that has been in business less than three
years with net tangible assets less than $5 million.  
 9 

The principal result or effect of being designated a  penny
stock  is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common
stock will be subject to the  penny stock  regulations set forth in Rules 15-2
through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2
requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors
with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually
signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days
before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor's account.
Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the
account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny
stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain
from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation,
investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine,
based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for
the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to
be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii)
provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which
the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a
signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it
accurately reflects the investor's financial situation, investment experience
and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more
difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their
shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or
otherwise.
