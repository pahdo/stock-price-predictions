No    te 1: Background 

The Tile Shop, LLC ( The Tile Shop ) was formed on December 30, 2002, as a Delaware limited liability company and began operations on January 1, 2003. Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings,  and together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in June 2012 to become the parent company of The Tile Shop, LLC. 

The Company is   a specialty retailer of manufactured and natural stone tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in the United States  .    The Company manufactures its own setting and maintenance materials, such as thinset, grout, and sealers.   The Company s primary market is retail sales to consumers, contractors, designers and home builders. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   120   stores in   31   states and an on-line retail operation. The Company also has distribution centers located in Michigan,   New Jersey,   Oklahoma  ,   Virginia, and Wisconsin. The Company has a sourcing operation located in China. 

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting on Form 10   Q. Accordingly, they do not include certain information and disclosures required for comprehensive financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal recurring nature, including the elimination of all intercompany transactions. Operating results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31,   2016  . 

These statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . The accounting policies used in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements are the same as those described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in such Form 10-K.   Debt issuance costs presented in the prior year Consolidated Balance Sheet   have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a new accounting standard that will modify current consolidation guidance. The standard makes changes to both the variable interest entity model and the voting interest entity model, including modifying the evaluation of whether limited partnerships or similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities and amending the guidance for assessing how relationships of related parties affect the consolidation analysis of variable interest entities. The standard was effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal 2016. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued a standard that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The Company adopted the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of 2016 and prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted.  The adoption of this standard resulted in a   $0.1   million reduction of other current assets, net, a   $0.3   million reduction of other assets, a   $0.3   million reduction of the current portion of long term debt, and a   $0.1   million reduction of long term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the period ended December 31, 2015.   

In March 2016, the FASB issued a standard that amends and simplifies the accounting for stock compensation. The guidance addresses various stock compensation aspects including accounting for income taxes, classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax withholding purposes, among other things. In order to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, the Company made a change in accounting policy to account for forfeitures when they occur, and as a result, the Company recognized a   $0.7   million cumulative-effect reduction to retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized an adjustment to reduce   additional paid-in capital   and   share-based compensation   by $0.1 million to account for current year forfeiture activity. 

The Company elected prospective transition for the requirement to classify excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The adoption did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, the Company will prospectively recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a discrete item in the period in which awards vest. The adoption did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company applied the modified retrospective method to recognize the cumulative effect of previously unrecognized excess tax benefits in opening retained earnings.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Company

(unaudited) 

also retrospectively applied the requirement to present employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes as a financing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

In May 2014, the FASB issued a final standard on revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard sets forth a single comprehensive model for recognizing and reporting revenue. The new standard is effective for the Company in fiscal year 2018 and permits the use of either a retrospective or a cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact of implementing the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued a standard requiring an entity s management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the financial statements. The guidance also sets forth a series of disclosures that are required in the event the entity s management concludes that there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard becomes effective for the Company in the annual financial statements for fiscal 2016 and requires an ongoing evaluation at each interim and annual period thereafter. The Company is currently assessing the effect the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued a standard which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory. Currently, an entity is required to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market, whereby market can be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The changes require that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby eliminating the use of the other two market methodologies. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Currently, the Company applies the net realizable value market option to measure inventories at the lower of cost or market. These changes become effective for the Company in fiscal 2017. The Company is currently assessing the effect the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued a standard that primarily requires organizations that lease assets to recognize the rights and obligations created by those leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The standard is effective in 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the effect the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2: Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined on the weighted average cost method) or market. Inventories consist primarily of merchandise held for sale. Inventories were comprised of the following as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The Company records provisions for losses related to shrinkage and other amounts that are otherwise not expected to be fully recoverable.   These provisions are calculated based on historical shrinkage, selling price, margin and current business   trends  . 

Note 3: Income taxes 

The Company s effective tax rate on net income before income taxes for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   38.6%   and   39.3%  , respectively.   The Company's effective tax rate on net income before income taxes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   39.3%   and   41.3%  , respectively.   The improvement in the effective tax rate   in 2016     was   due to a  n increase in incentive stock option exercise activity classified as a disqualifying disposition to the option holder that gives rise to a deduction for the Company.      The Company   s tax rate   also benefitted from a   decrease in non-deductible incentive stock-based compensation expense in 2016 combined with a reduction in the level of state tax rate changes that triggered unfavorable deferred tax adjustments in 2015.   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of

$2.9   million and   $2.4   million, respectively.        For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of   $11.8   million and   $8.4   million, respectively. 

The Company records interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company has   not   recognized any liabilities for uncertain tax positions   nor   have interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions been accrued. 

Note 4: Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, after taking into consideration all dilutive potential shares outstanding during the period. 

Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:  

Note 5: Other Accrued Liabilities 

Other accrued liabilities consisted of the following:  

Note 6: Long-term Debt  

On June 2, 2015,   Holdings   and its operating subsidiary, The Tile Shop  , LLC  ,    as well as certain other subsidiaries of Holdings  , entered into a credit agreement with Fifth Third Bank, Bank of America, N.A., and Huntington National Bank (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a   $125.0   million senior secured credit facility, comprised of a   five  -year   $50.0   million term loan and a   $75.0   million revolving line of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by virtually all of the assets of the Company, including but not limited to, inventory, receivables, equipment and real property. Borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement bear interest at either a base rate or a LIBOR-based rate, at the option of the Company. The LIBOR-based rate will range from LIBOR plus   1.50%   to   2.00%  , depending on The Tile Shop s leverage ratio. The base rate is equal to the greatest of: (a) the Federal funds rate plus   0.50%  , (b) the Fifth Third Bank  prime rate,  and (c) the Eurodollar rate plus   1.00%  , in each case plus   0.50%   to   1.00%   depending on

(unaudited) 

The Tile Shop s leverage ratio. At   September 30, 2016   the base interest rate was   4.00%   and the LIBOR-based interest rate was   2.03%  . Borrowings outstanding consisted of   $23.4   million on the term loan as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company can elect to prepay the term loan without incurring a penalty. Additional borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement may be used to support the Company s growth and for working capital purposes. The Company incurred   $1.0   million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Credit Agreement  , which   will be amortized over the five-year life of the Credit Agreement. Debt issuance costs attributable to the term loan are classified as a reduction of debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Debt issuance costs attributable to the revolving line of credit are classified as assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The term loan requires quarterly principal payments as follows (in thousands): 

The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, conditions to borrowings, and restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the Company s ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions, incur additional debt, incur liens, make investments, or enter into transactions with affiliates on other than terms that could be obtained in an arm s length transaction. The Credit Agreement also includes financial and other covenants  ,   including covenants to maintain certain fixed charge coverage ratios and rent adjusted leverage ratios. In addition, except with respect to pro rata payments made by The Tile Shop or other subsidiaries to Holdings or any other equity owner of such entity, the Credit Agreement prohibits the payments of cash dividends. The Company was in compliance with the covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Long-term debt  , net of debt issuance costs,   consist  ed   of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

Note 7: Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The accompanying     C  onsolidated   F  inancial   S  tatements include the following financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses, capital leases, notes payable, and debt. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their fair values due to their short-term maturities. The carrying value of the Company s borrowings and capital lease obligation approximates fair value based upon the market interest rates available to the Company for debt and capital lease obligations with similar risk and maturities. 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, the Company uses a three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs: 

Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 

11

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(unaudited) 

Level 2   Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly, including: 

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;     

Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets;     

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and     

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.     

Level 3   Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions. 

Note 8: Equity Incentive Plans 

Stock options: 

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards at fair value. The financial statements for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   include compensation cost for the portion of outstanding awards that vested during those periods. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term. Total stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was   $0.6   million   and   $1.1   million   for     the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .    Total stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was   $2.6   million and   $2.7   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.   Stock-based compensation   expense   is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying   C  onsolidated   S  tatements of   O  perations. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding stock options to purchase   2,348,777   shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of   $13.69  . 

Restricted stock: 

The Company awards restricted comm  on shares to selected employees   and   to   non-employee directors. Recipients are not required to provide any consideration other than continued service.   Restricted   share awards are subject to certain restrictions on transfer, and all or part of the shares awarded may be subject to forfeiture upon the occurrence of certain events, including employment termination. The restricted stock is valued at its grant date fair value and expensed over the requisite service period or the vesting term of the awards. Total stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock was   $0.3   million and   $0.5   million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.   Total stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock was   $0.8   million and   $1.5   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.   Stock-based compensation   expense   is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying   C  onsolidated   S  tatements of   O  perations. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   98,384   outstanding restricted common shares. 

Note 9:     New Market Tax Credit 

In July 2013  ,   the Company entered into a financing transaction with Chase Community Equity ( Chase ), and U.S. Bank Community, LLC ( U.S. Bank , and, collectively with Chase, the  investors ) related to a   $19.1   million acquisition, rehabilitation and construction of the Company s new distribution and manufacturing center in Durant, Oklahoma. The investors made a capital contribution to, and Tile Shop Lending made a loan to  ,   Chase New Market Tax Credit, The Tile Shop of Oklahoma Investment Fund, LLC, and The Tile Shop Investment Fund LLC (the  Investment Funds ) under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit ( NMTC ) program. The NMTC program was provided for in the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 (the  Act ) and is intended to induce capital investment in qualified lower income communities. The Act permits taxpayers to claim credits against their Federal income taxes for up to 39% of qualified investments in the equity of community development entities ( CDEs ). CDEs are privately managed investment institutions that are certified to make qualified low-income community investments.

(unaudited) 

In July 2013, Tile Shop Lending loaned   $13.5   million to the Investment Funds at an interest rate of   1.35%   per year and with a maturity of September 30, 2043. The Investment Funds then contributed the loan to certain CDEs, which, in turn, loaned the funds on similar terms to Tile Shop of Oklahoma, LLC, an indirect  , wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings  . The proceeds of the loans from the CDEs (including loans representing the capital contribution made by the investors, net of syndication fees) were used to partially fund the new manufacturing and distribution center project. 

In July 2013, the investors also contributed   $5.6   million to the Investment Funds and, by virtue of such contribution, are entitled to substantially all of the tax benefits derived from the NMTCs, while the Company effectively received net loan proceeds equal to the investors  contributions to the Investment Fund. This transaction includes a put/call provision whereby the Company may be obligated or entitled to repurchase the investors  interest. The Company believes that the investors will exercise the put option in September 2020 at the end of the recapture period. The value attributed to the put/call is de minimis. The NMTC is subject to 100% recapture for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code. The Company is required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangement. Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized and, therefore, could require the Company to indemnify the investors for any loss or recapture of NMTCs related to the financing until such time as the obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved. The Company does not anticipate any credit recaptures will be required in connection with this arrangement. 

The Company has determined that the financing arrangement with the Investment Funds and CDEs contains a variable interest entity ( VIE ). The ongoing activities of the Investment Funds   collecting and remitting interest and fees and NMTC compliance   were all considered in the initial design and are not expected to significantly affect economic performance throughout the life of the Investment Funds. Management considered the contractual arrangements that obligate the Company to deliver tax benefits and provide various other guarantees to the structure; Chase s and U.S. Bank s lack of a material interest in the underling economics of the project; and the fact that the Company is obligated to absorb losses of the Investment Fund. The Company concluded that   it is   the primary beneficiary of the VIE and consolidated the Investment Funds, as a VIE, in accordance with the accounting standards for consolidation. Chase s and U.S. Bank s contributions of   $4.4   million, net of syndication fees, are included in cash and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The benefit of this net $4.4 million contribution is recognized as a decrease in depreciation expense as the Company amortizes the contribution liability over the   seven  -year compliance period as it is being earned through the on-going compliance with the conditions of the NMTC program. As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance of the contribution liability was   $2.  6   million and is classified as other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company,   two   of its former executive officers,   five   of its outside directors, and certain companies affiliated with the directors, are defendants in a consolidated class action brought under the federal securities laws and now pending in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota under the caption Beaver County Employees  Retirement Fund, et al. v. Tile Shop Holdings, Inc., et al. Several rel  ated actions were filed in 2013   and   subsequently   consolidated. The plaintiffs are   three   investors who represent classes consisting of (1) all purchasers of Tile Shop common stock between August 22, 2012 and January 28, 2014 (the  class period ), seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) all purchasers of Tile Shop common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Company s December 2012 registration statement, seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Act of 1933.   Six   firms who were underwriters in the December 2012 secondary public offering are also named as defendants.  The plaintiffs allege that during the class period, defendants failed to disclose certain related party transactions in the Company s SEC filings and press releases.  The plaintiffs assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition to attorneys  fees and costs, the plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of class members.  Discovery has closed, and the parties are in the process of briefing and arguing dispositive motions. 

The Company also is a Defendant in   three   actions brought derivatively on behalf of the Company by   three   shareholders in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware ( Delaware Chancery Court ).   Two   of the actions were filed in 2015 and then consolidated   (the  Consolidated Actions )  .   On July 31, 2015, the plaintiff-shareholders in   the Consolidated     A  ctions filed a consolidated complaint. The consolidated complaint names as defendants   six   members of the Company s Board of Directors and a former employee of the Company. The third action   (the  Third Action )   was filed on or about September 28, 2016 against   seven   members of the Company s Board of Directors,   a   former officer, and   a   former employee.   All of the complaints track many of the same factual allegations as have been made in the above-described federal securities class action. They allege that the defendant-directors and/or officer breached their fiduciary duties by failing to adopt adequate internal controls for the Company, by approving false and misleading statements issued by the Company, by causing the Company to violate generally accepted accounting principles and SEC regulations, by engaging in or approving alleged insider trading, and by permitting the Company s primary product to contain illegal amounts of lead. The complaints also allege claims for insider trading and/or unjust enrichment. The complaints seek damages, disgorgement, an award of attorneys  fees and other expenses, and an order compelling changes to the Company s corporate governance and internal procedures. In 2015, the defendants moved to dismiss the   C  onsolidated   Actions  , or in the alternative, to stay the   C  onsolidated   A  ction  s   pending resolution of the

(unaudited) 

Beaver County Employees  Retirement Fund action described above.  Subsequently, upon agreement of the parties, the Court entered an Order staying the   C  onsolidated   A  ction  s  .  Recently the Company moved to dismiss the newly-filed   Third     A  ction, or in the alternative, to stay   the Third Action   until resolution of the Beaver County Employees  Retirement Fund action described above, or until the Company s Board of Directors takes action on the demand described below.  That motion has not yet been decided. 

By letter dated May 19, 2016, a shareholder of the Company  , through his attorney and prior to filing the Third Action,   demanded that the Board of Directors investigate alleged breaches of fiduciary duty related to the same matters described above, and take action against certain present and former officers and directors of the Company.   The Board of Directors has appointed a committee of   two   independent directors to investigate and evaluate the matters raised in the demand letter, and to recommend to the Company s Board of Directors what actions, if any should be taken by the Company with respect to the matters raised in the demand letter. 

Given the uncertainty of litigation and the preliminary stage of these cases, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from these actions. The Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance policies that may reduce the Company s exposure, if any. In the event the Company incurs a loss, the Company will pursue recoveries to the maximum extent available under these policies. 

The Company is also, from time to time, subject to claims and disputes arising in the normal course of business.  In the opinion of management, while the outcome of such claims and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company s ultimate liability in connection with these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Overview and Recent Trends 

We are a specialty retailer of manufactured and natural stone tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in the United States. We offer a wide selection of products, attractive prices, and exceptional customer service in an extensive showroom setting. As of   September 30, 2016  , we operated   120   stores in   31   states, with an average size of   21,400   square feet. We also sell our products on our website. 

We purchase our tile products and accessories directly from suppliers and manufacture our own setting and maintenance materials, such as thinset, grout, and sealers. We believe that our long-term supplier relationships, together with our design, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, enable us to offer a broad assortment of high-quality products to our customers, who are primarily homeowners and professionals, at competitive prices. We have invested significant resources to develop our proprietary brands and product sources, and we believe that we are a leading retailer of manufactured and natural stone tiles, accessories, and related materials in the United States. 

We believe that the highly-fragmented United States retail tile market provides us with a significant opportunity to expand our store base. We opened   seven   new stores during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , including one relocation, while we opened   four   new stores during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We plan to open an additional four new stores and relocate one additional store during the remainder of 2016. We believe that there will continue to be additional expansion opportunities in the United States and Canada. We expect store base growth will drive productivity and operational efficiencies. Our growth plans also require us to maintain significant inventory on-hand in order to fulfill transactions at these new locations. 

For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we reported net sales of   $78.6   million and   $247.5   million, respectively, and income from operations of   $7.8   million and   $31.3   million respectively. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we reported net sales of   $72.4   million and   $221.1   million, respectively, and income from operations of   $6.7   million and   $22.3   million, respectively. The increase in net sales and income from operations was primarily due to same store sales growth of   5.7%     and   9.7%   for the     three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was   $50.7   million and   $51.4   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was used to fund operations, new store construction activities and debt repayments. We expect to continue to fund our capital expenditures and daily operations from our operating cash flows. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash of   $9.8   million and working capital of   $37.7   million.

Key Components of our Consolidated Statements of Operations 

Net Sales     Net sales represents total charges to customers, net of returns, and includes freight charged to customers. We recognize sales at the time that the customer takes possession of the merchandise or final delivery of the product has occurred. We recognize service revenue, which consists primarily of freight charges for home delivery, when the service has been rendered. We are required to charge and collect sales and other taxes on sales to our customers and remit these taxes back to government authorities. Total revenues do not include sales tax because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales tax. 

Comparable store sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $4.1   million, compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .    Comparable store sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $19.9   million, compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .    The table below sets forth information about our same store sales growth for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .   

The   increase in same store sales growth is primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of transactions, as well as increases in average transaction size. Same store sale amounts include total charges to customers less any actual returns, and the change in the returns provision related to comparable stores. In general, we   include a new or relocated   store   in the   comparable   store sales calculation   on the first day of the 13th full month of operation.  

Between   October   1, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , we opened   nine   new   store   locations. Incremental net sales of   $2.1   million   and   $6.6   million   occurred in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     respectively,   from stores not included in the comparable store base.  

Cost of Sales   Cost of sales consists primarily of material costs, freight, duties, and storage and delivery of product to the customers, as well as costs associated with manufacturing of setting and maintenance materials.   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , our c  ost of sales as a percentage of net sales was   29.8%   and   30.0%  , respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to   decreases in shrink, damage and other inventory   control process improvements  .    F  or   the     nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  ,   our co  st   of sales as a percentage of net sales was   29.9%   and   30.8  %    respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to     fewer   discounts,   improved   freight collection, and inventory control process improvements  . 

Selling,   G  eneral, and   A  dministrative   E  xpenses   Selling, general, and administrative expenses consists of general operating expenses.   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , our selling, general, and administrative expenses     a  s   percentage of net sales were   60.3%   and   60.8%  , respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to a  n increase in same store sales  , which outpaced the growth of selling, general, and administrative expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .    For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , our selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were   57.5%   and   59.1%  , respectively.  The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in same store sales, which outpaced the growth of selling, general, and administrative expense     for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

Provision for   Income   T  axes   We are subject to income tax in the United States as well as   in   other tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Our effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   38.6%   and   39.3%  , respectively  .     Our effective   tax rate for the     nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   39.3%   and   41.3%  , respectively.   The improvement in the three and   n  ine   m  onths   effective tax rate is due to a  n increase in incentive stock option exercise activity classified as a disqualifying disposition to the option holder that gives rise to a deduction for the Company. The Company s tax rate also benefitted from a   decrease in non-deductible incentive stock-based compensation expense in 2016 combined with a reduction in the level of state tax rate changes that triggered unfavorable deferred tax adjustments in 2015. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by taking net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generall  y accepted in the United States     (   GAAP   )  , and adjusting for interest expense, income taxes,   depreciation and amortization  , stock based compensati  on expense, and special charges, which consist of shareholder and other   litigation   costs  ,    a  nd losses incurred with the renegotiation of debt  . Adjusted EBITDA margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.   Free cash flows is calculated by taking net cash provided by operating activities and subtracting net cash used for   the purchase of property, plant and equipment  . Non-GAAP net income excludes the special charges  ,     w  hich consist   of shareholder and other   litigation costs  ,   and losses incurred in connection with the renegotiation of debt  ,   and is net of tax.

We believe that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining management incentive compensation, and for budgeting and planning purposes. These measures are used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and our board of directors. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other specialty retailers, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. 

The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   is as follows: 

(1)   Shareholder and other litigation costs. 

The reconciliation of free cash flows to net cash provided by operating activities for   the     three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   is as follows:

Our management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Provision for Income Taxes   Income tax provision increased   $0.5   million for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   due to higher income before income taxes in the   third   quarter of   2016  .

The improvement in the three month effective tax rate is due to an increase in incentive stock option exercise activity classified as a disqualifying disposition to the option holder that gives rise to a deduction for us.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal uses of liquidity have been investments in working capital and capital expenditures. Our principal sources of liquidity are   $9.8   million of cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016  , our cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under our credit facility. We expect to use this liquidity for opening new stores, purchasing additional merchandise inventory, maintaining our existing stores, reducing outstanding debt, and general corporate purposes. 

On June 2, 2015, we and our operating subsidiary, The Tile Shop, LLC,   as well as certain other of our subsidiaries,   entered into a credit agreement with Fifth Third Bank, Bank of America, N.A., and Huntington National Bank (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides us with a $125.0 million senior secured credit facility, comprised of a five-year $50.0 million term loan and a $75.0 million revolving line of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by virtually all of our assets, including but not limited to, inventory, receivables, equipment and real property. Borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement bear interest at either a base rate or a LIBOR-based rate, at our option. The LIBOR-based rate will range from LIBOR plus 1.50% to 2.00%, depending on The Tile Shop s leverage ratio. The base rate is equal to the greatest of: (a) the Federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the Fifth Third Bank  prime rate,  and (c) the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus 0.50% to 1.00% depending on The Tile Shop s leverage ratio. At   September 30, 2016   the base interest rate was   4.00%   and the LIBOR-based interest rate was   2.03%  . Borrowings outstanding   were     $23.4   million on the term loan as of   September 30, 2016  . We can elect to prepay the term loan without incurring a penalty. The term loan requires quarterly principal payments as follows (in thousands): 

The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, conditions to borrowings, and restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions, incur additional debt, incur liens, make investments, or enter into transactions with affiliates on other than terms that could be obtained in an arm s length transaction. The Credit Agreement also includes financial and other covenants  ,   including covenants to maintain certain fixed charge coverage ratios and rent adjusted leverage ratios. In addition, except with respect to pro rata payments made by The Tile Shop or other subsidiaries to Holdings or any other equity owner of such entity, the Credit Agreement prohibits the payments of cash dividends. We were in compliance with the covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 

We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months. 

Capital expenditures paid in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $19.6   million. Approximately $  13.1   million was for new store build-out, remodels of existing store  s, and merchandising projects, and   approximately $  4.5   million was for our information technology infrastructure   in stores  . The remainder was for   distribution facilities and other general   corporate purposes. 

Our future capital requirements will vary based on the number of additional stores, distribution centers, and manufacturing facilities that we open and the number of stores that we choose to renovate. Our decisions regarding opening, relocating, or renovating stores, and whether to engage in strategic acquisitions, will be based in part on macroeconomic factors and the general state of the U.S. economy, as well as the local economies in the markets in which our stores are located. We   plan   to open an additional   four new   stores   and relocate one additional store   during   the remainder of     2016  .  Total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $30 million in   2016  .

Cash flows 

The following table summa  rizes our cash flow data for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

Operating activities 

Cash provided by operating activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $50.7   million, compared to   $51.4   million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   is   primarily   attributable to   a  n     $8.6 million   decrease   in   cash flows attributable to the change in   income tax receivable/payable   balances  , partially offset by a $6.3 million increase in net income, compared to the prior year. 

Investing activities 

Net cash used in investing activities totaled   $19.6   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $12.2   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net cash used in investing activities in each period was primarily for capital purchases   for new store build-outs, remodels of existing stores, merchandising projects, information technology in stores, distribution facilities, and other general corporate purposes. 

Financing activities 

Net cash used in financing activities was   $31.5   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $30.3   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Cash used in financing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily for payments of long-term debt and capital lease obligations of   $32.1   million. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with our debt covenants. We intend to make principal payments due in future periods using cash from operations.  

Cash and cash equivalents totaled   $9.8   million at   September 30, 2016  , versus   $10.3   million at   December 31, 2015  .    The Company   ha  d   working capital of   $37.7   million at   September 30, 2016  , compared to working capital of   $47.5   million at   December 31, 2015  . 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any  off-balance sheet arrangements  (as such term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that could have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Contractual arrangements 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a new accounting standard that will modify current consolidation guidance. The standard makes changes to both the variable interest entity model and the voting interest entity model, including modifying the evaluation of whether limited partnerships or similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities and amending the guidance for assessing how relationships of related parties affect the consolidation analysis of variable interest entities. The standard was effective for us as of the beginning of fiscal 2016. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued a standard that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. We adopted the provisions of this  

21   

Table of Contents  

statement in the first quarter of 2016 and prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted.  The adoption of this standard resulted in a $0.1 million reduction of other current assets, net, a $0.3 million reduction of other assets, a $0.3 million reduction of the current portion of long term debt, and a $0.1 million reduction of long term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the period ended December 31, 2015.   

In March 2016, the FASB issued a standard that amends and simplifies the accounting for stock compensation. The guidance addresses various stock compensation aspects including accounting for income taxes, classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax withholding purposes, among other things. In order to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, we made a change in accounting policy to account for forfeitures when they occur, and as a result, we recognized a $0.7 million cumulative-effect reduction to retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized an adjustment to reduce additional paid-in capital and share-based compensation by $0.1 million to account for current year forfeiture activity. 

We elected prospective transition for the requirement to classify excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The adoption did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, we will prospectively recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a discrete item in the period in which awards vest. The adoption did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  We applied the modified retrospective method to recognize the cumulative effect of previously unrecognized excess tax benefits in opening retained earnings.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the year ended December 31, 2015.  We also retrospectively applied the requirement to present employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes as a financing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

In May 2014, the FASB issued a final standard on revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard sets forth a single comprehensive model for recognizing and reporting revenue. The new standard is effective for us in fiscal year 2018 and permits the use of either a retrospective or a cumulative effect transition method. We are currently assessing the impact of implementing the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued a standard requiring an entity s management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the financial statements. The guidance also sets forth a series of disclosures that are required in the event the entity s management concludes that there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard becomes effective for us in the annual financial statements for fiscal 2016 and requires an ongoing evaluation at each interim and annual period thereafter. We are currently assessing the effect the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued a standard which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory. Currently, an entity is required to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market, whereby market can be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The changes require that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby eliminating the use of the other two market methodologies. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Currently, we apply the net realizable value market option to measure inventories at the lower of cost or market. These changes become effective for us in fiscal 2017. We are currently assessing the effect the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued a standard that primarily requires organizations that lease assets to recognize the rights and obligations created by those leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The standard is effective in 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the effect the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that information relating to the Company is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016   and have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No changes to our internal control over financial reporting occurr  ed   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).

IT    EM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The Company,   two   of its former executive officers,   five   of its outside directors, and certain companies affiliated with the directors, are defendants in a consolidated class action brought under the federal securities laws and now pending in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota under the caption Beaver County Employees  Retirement Fund, et al. v. Tile Shop Holdings, Inc., et al. Several rel  ated actions were filed in 2013   and   subsequently   consolidated. The plaintiffs are   three   investors who represent classes consisting of (1) all purchasers of Tile Shop common stock between August 22, 2012 and January 28, 2014 (the  class period ), seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) all purchasers of Tile Shop common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Company s December 2012 registration statement, seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Act of 1933.   Six   firms who were underwriters in the December 2012 secondary public offering are also named as defendants.  The plaintiffs allege that during the class period, defendants failed to disclose certain related party transactions in the Company s SEC filings and press releases.  The plaintiffs assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition to attorneys  fees and costs, the plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of class members.  Discovery has closed, and the parties are in the process of briefing and arguing dispositive motions. 

The Company also is a Defendant in   three   actions brought derivatively on behalf of the Company by   three   shareholders in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware ( Delaware Chancery Court ).   Two   of the actions were filed in 2015 and then consolidated   (the  Consolidated Actions )  .   On July 31, 2015, the plaintiff-shareholders in   the Consolidated     A  ctions filed a consolidated complaint. The consolidated complaint names as defendants   six   members of the Company s Board of Directors and a former employee of the Company. The third action   (the  Third Action )   was filed on or about September 28, 2016 against seven members of the Company s Board of Directors, a former officer, and a former employee.   All of the complaints track many of the same factual allegations as have been made in the above-described federal securities class action. They allege that the defendant-directors and/or officer breached their fiduciary duties by failing to adopt adequate internal controls for the Company, by approving false and misleading statements issued by the Company, by causing the Company to violate generally accepted accounting principles and SEC regulations, by engaging in or approving alleged insider trading, and by permitting the Company s primary product to contain illegal amounts of lead. The complaints also allege claims for insider trading and/or unjust enrichment. The complaints seek damages, disgorgement, an award of attorneys  fees and other expenses, and an order compelling changes to the Company s corporate governance and internal procedures. In 2015, the defendants moved to dismiss the   C  onsolidated   Actions  , or in the alternative, to stay the   C  onsolidated   A  ction  s   pending resolution of the Beaver County Employees  Retirement Fund action described above.  Subsequently, upon agreement of the parties, the Court entered an Order staying the   C  onsolidated   A  ction  s  .  Recently the Company moved to dismiss the newly-filed   Third     A  ction, or in the alternative, to stay   the Third Action   until resolution of the Beaver County Employees  Retirement Fund action described above, or until the Company s Board of Directors takes action on the demand described below.  That motion has not yet been decided. 

By letter dated May 19, 2016, a shareholder of the Company  , through his attorney and prior to filing the Third Action,   demanded that the Board of Directors investigate alleged breaches of fiduciary duty related to the same matters described above, and take action against certain present and former officers and directors of the Company.   The Board of Directors has appointed a committee of two independent directors to investigate and evaluate the matters raised in the demand letter, and to recommend to the Company s Board of Directors what actions, if any should be taken by the Company with respect to the matters raised in the demand letter. 

Given the uncertainty of litigation and the preliminary stage of these cases, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from these actions. The Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance policies that may reduce the Company s exposure, if any. In the event the Company incurs a loss, the Company will pursue recoveries to the maximum extent available under these policies. 

The Company is also, from time to time, subject to claims and disputes arising in the normal course of business.  In the opinion of management, while the outcome of such claims and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company s ultimate liability in connection with these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
