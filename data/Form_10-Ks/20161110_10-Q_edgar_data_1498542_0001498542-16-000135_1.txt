  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 
  Cole Real Estate Income Strategy (Daily NAV), Inc. (the  Company ) is a Maryland corporation, incorporated on July 27, 2010, that qualified as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning in its taxable year ended December 31, 2012. Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through Cole Real Estate Income Strategy (Daily NAV) Operating Partnership, LP ( Cole OP ), a Delaware limited partnership. The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns, directly or indirectly,   100%   of the partnership interests in Cole OP. The Company is externally managed by Cole Real Estate Income Strategy (Daily NAV) Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Cole Advisors ), an affiliate of the Company s sponsor, Cole Capital       , which is a trade name used to refer to a group of affiliated entities directly or indirectly controlled by VEREIT, Inc. ( VEREIT ), a widely-held public company whose shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: VER). VEREIT indirectly owns and/or controls the Company s external advisor, Cole Advisors, the Company s dealer manager, Cole Capital Corporation ( CCC ), the Company s property manager, CREI Advisors, LLC ( CREI Advisors ), and Cole Capital.  
  On December 6, 2011, pursuant to a registration statement filed on Form S-11 (Registration No. 333-169535) (the  Initial Registration Statement ) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), the Company commenced its initial public offering on a  best efforts  basis of   $4.0 billion   in shares of common stock. On August 26, 2013, pursuant to a registration statement filed on Form S-11 (Registration No. 333-186656) (the  Multi-Class Registration Statement ) under the Securities Act, the Company designated the existing shares of the Company s common stock that were sold prior to such date to be Wrap Class shares ( W Shares ) of common stock and registered   two   new classes of the Company s common stock, Advisor Class shares ( A Shares ) and Institutional Class shares ( I Shares ). Pursuant to the Multi-Class Registration Statement, the Company is offering up to   $4.0 billion   in shares of common stock of the   three   classes (the  Offering ), consisting of   $3.5 billion   in shares in the Company s primary offering (the  Primary Offering ) and   $500.0 million   in shares pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the  DRIP ). The Company is offering to sell any combination of W Shares, A Shares and I Shares with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had issued approximately   17.8 million   shares of common stock in the Offering for gross offering proceeds of   $313.8 million   before offering costs and selling commissions, and the current portion of dealer manager fees and distribution fees of   $7.5 million  . 
  The per share purchase price for each class of common stock varies from day-to-day and, on each business day, is equal to, for each class of common stock, the Company s net asset value ( NAV ) for such class, divided by the number of shares of that class outstanding as of the close of business on the previous day, plus, for A Shares sold in the Primary Offering, applicable selling commissions. The Company s NAV per share is calculated daily as of the close of business by an independent fund accountant using a process that reflects (1) estimated values of each of the Company s commercial real estate assets, related liabilities and notes receivable secured by real estate provided periodically by the Company s independent valuation expert in individual appraisal reports, (2) daily updates in the price of liquid assets for which third party market quotes are available, (3) accruals of daily distributions and (4) estimates of daily accruals, on a net basis, of operating revenues, expenses, debt service costs and fees. As of   September 30, 2016  , the NAV per share for W Shares, A Shares and I Shares was   $18.25  ,   $18.13   and   $18.37  , respectively. The Company s NAV is not audited or reviewed by its independent registered public accounting firm. 
  The Company intends to use substantially all of the net proceeds from the Offering to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of (1) necessity retail, office and industrial properties that are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term net leases and are strategically located throughout the United States and U.S. protectorates, (2) notes receivable secured by commercial real estate, including the origination of loans, and (3) cash, cash equivalents, other short-term investments and traded real estate-related securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   96   commercial properties located in   31   states, containing   2.6 million   rentable square feet of commercial space, including the square feet of buildings which are on land subject to ground leases. As of   September 30, 2016  , the rentable square feet at these properties was   99.2%   leased, including month-to-month agreements, if any. 
  The Company is structured as a perpetual-life, non-exchange traded REIT. This means that, subject to regulatory approval of our filing for additional offerings, the Company will be selling shares of common stock on a continuous basis and for an indefinite period of time to the extent permissible under applicable law. The Company will endeavor to take all reasonable actions to avoid interruptions in the continuous offering of shares of common stock. The Company reserves the right to terminate the Offering at any time.

NOTE 2   CORRECTION OF PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS 
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company was advised of a recent interpretative clarification regarding our industry s accounting of the recognition of ongoing periodic fees ( OPFs ), which include dealer manager fees and distribution fees that are paid monthly related to the issuance of certain classes of common stock. The Company previously recorded OPFs as a reduction to equity on a monthly basis when payment was due to the dealer manager. The Company assessed this policy in light of the recent interpretive clarification, and determined that a liability should have been recorded for the estimated amount of total OPFs to be paid in future periods upon issuance of shares structured with OPFs. This determination affected the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of stockholders  equity and supplemental disclosures of non-cash investing and financing activities for historical periods beginning in 2011 through March 31, 2016. There was no impact to the statements of operations or comprehensive income (loss) or net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing or financing activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company assessed the materiality of the correction on prior periods  financial statements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 250 ( ASC 250 ),   Presentation of Financial Statements  , and concluded that these misstatements were not material to any of the Company s previously issued consolidated financial statements. 
  In accordance with ASC 250, the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, the consolidated statement of stockholders  equity January 1, 2016 beginning balance and the consolidated statements of cash flows       supplemental disclosures of non-cash investing and financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   have been adjusted to reflect the correction. 
  The following tables show the affected line items within the consolidated financial statements (dollars in thousands):

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company s condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding interim financial reporting, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the statements for the interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods. Results for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of full year results. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and related notes thereto set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements should also be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
  The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain amounts in the Company s prior period condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The Company has chosen to combine depreciation of   $1.0 million   and   $3.2 million   and amortization of   $498,000   and   $1.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, into the line item depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of operations. In addition, the Company has chosen to combine depreciation of   $3.2 million   and amortization of intangible lease assets and below-market lease intangibles, net of   $1.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, into the line item depreciation and amortization, net in the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of cash flows.  
  These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported totals or subtotals. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Real Estate Investments 
  Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Amounts capitalized to real estate assets consist of the cost of acquisition, construction and any tenant improvements, major improvements and betterments that extend the useful life of the real estate assets and leasing costs. All acquisition-related expenses, repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
  The Company considers the period of future benefit of each respective asset to determine the appropriate useful life. The estimated useful lives of the Company s real estate assets by class are generally as follows: 
                   Buildings 
      
    40 years 
      Tenant improvements 
      
    Lesser of useful life or lease term 
      Intangible lease assets 
      
    Lease term 

Recoverability of Real Estate Assets 
  The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate assets may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators that the Company considers include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy or other credit concerns of a property s major tenant, such as a history of late payments, rental concessions and other factors, a significant decrease in a property s revenues due to lease terminations, vacancies, co-tenancy clauses, reduced lease rates or other circumstances. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of the assets by determining whether the carrying amount of the assets will be recovered through the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. In the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, the Company will adjust the real estate assets to

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  September 30, 2016 

their respective fair values and recognize an impairment loss. Generally, fair value will be determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and recent comparable sales transactions. No impairment indicators were identified and   no   impairment losses were recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  Assets Held for Sale 
  When a real estate asset is identified by the Company as held for sale, the Company will cease depreciation and amortization of the assets related to the property and estimate the fair value, net of selling costs. If, in management s opinion, the fair value, net of selling costs, of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an adjustment to the carrying amount would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property, net of selling costs. There were   no   assets identified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets 
  Upon the acquisition of real properties, the Company allocates the purchase price to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above- and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, based in each case on their respective fair values. Acquisition-related expenses are expensed as incurred. The Company utilizes independent appraisals to assist in the determination of the fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land and buildings). The information in the appraisal, along with any additional information available to the Company s management, is used in estimating the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to land. Other information in the appraisal, such as building value and market rents, may be used by the Company s management in estimating the allocation of purchase price to the building and to intangible lease assets and liabilities. The appraisal firm has no involvement in management s allocation decisions other than providing this market information. 
  The determination of the fair values of the real estate assets and liabilities acquired requires the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, capitalization and discount rates, interest rates and other variables. The use of alternative estimates may result in a different allocation of the Company s purchase price, which could materially impact the Company s results of operations. 
  Investment in Marketable Securities 
  Investment in marketable securities consists primarily of the Company s investment in corporate and government debt securities. The Company determines the appropriate classification for debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company classified its investments as available-for-sale as the Company is not actively trading the securities; however, the Company may sell them prior to their maturity. These investments are carried at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income (loss). 
  The Company monitors its available-for-sale securities for impairments. A loss is recognized when the Company determines that a decline in the estimated fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary. The Company considers many factors in determining whether the impairment of a security is deemed to be other-than-temporary, including, but not limited to, the length of time the security has had a decline in estimated fair value below its amortized cost, the amount of the unrealized loss, the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, external credit ratings and recent changes in such ratings. The analysis of determining whether the impairment of a security is deemed to be other-than-temporary requires significant judgments and assumptions. The use of alternative judgments and assumptions could result in a different conclusion. 
  The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method and is recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited statements of operations in interest and other expense, net. Upon the sale of a security, the realized net gain or loss is computed on the specific identification method. 
  Restricted Cash 
  The Company had   $806,000   and   $118,000   in restricted cash as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Included in restricted cash were escrowed investor proceeds of   $281,000   and   $50,000   for which shares of common stock had not been issued as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Restricted cash as of   September 30, 2016   included   $500,000   held by a lender in an escrow account for a certain property in accordance with the associated loan agreement, and   no   amounts were held for such loan as of   December 31, 2015  . Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016   and  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  
  COLE REAL ESTATE INCOME STRATEGY (DAILY NAV), INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  September 30, 2016 

December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $25,000   and   $68,000  , respectively, in lender cash management accounts. As part of certain debt agreements, rent from certain of the Company s tenants is deposited directly into a lockbox account, from which funds in excess of the required minimum balance are disbursed on a weekly basis to the Company. 
  Dealer Manager and Distribution Fees 
  The Company pays CCC dealer manager and distribution fees, which are calculated on a daily basis in the amount of 1/365th of the amount indicated in the table below for each class of common stock: 

The dealer manager and distribution fees are paid monthly in arrears. An estimated liability for future dealer manager and distribution fees payable to CCC is recognized at the time each share is sold and included in due to affiliates in the condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets with a corresponding decrease to capital in excess of par value. The Company recognized a liability for future dealer manager and distribution fees payable to CCC of   $10.8 million   and   $6.2 million  , as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Certain properties have leases where minimum rental payments increase during the term of the lease. The Company records rental income for the full term of each lease on a straight-line basis when earned and collectability is reasonably assured. When the Company acquires a property, the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purpose of this calculation. The Company defers the recognition of contingent rental income, such as percentage rents, until the specific target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved. Expected reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses are included in tenant reimbursement income in the period when such costs are incurred. 
  The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent, including any unbilled straight-line rent, and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the Company will record an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have an allowance for uncollectible accounts. 
  Earnings per Share 
  We have   three   classes of common stock with nonforfeitable dividend rights that are determined based on a different NAV for each class. Accordingly, we utilize the two-class method to determine our earnings per share, which results in the same earnings per share for each of the classes. Under the two-class method, earnings per class of common share are computed by dividing the sum of the distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares for each class of common stock for the respective period. Diluted (loss) income per share considers the effect of any potentially dilutive share equivalents, of which the Company had none for each of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers     The requirements were amended to remove inconsistencies in revenue requirements and to provide a more complete framework for addressing revenue issues across a broad range of industries and transaction types. The revised standard s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revised standard also clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract to a customer. These provisions are effective January 1, 2018, and are to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The Company has identified its revenue streams and is in the process of

evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements and internal accounting processes; however, as the majority of the Company s revenue is derived from real estate lease contracts, as discussed in relation to ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ), the Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 or related amendments and modifications issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by various standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that certain of these new accounting requirements may have on the Company s accounting and related reporting and disclosures in the Company s consolidated financial statements: 
  ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments (Subtopic 825-10)     The amendments in this update require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in this update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive (loss) income, the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the amendments in this update require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the consolidated balance sheets or the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 840,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as either finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use ( ROU ) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 and are required to be applied on a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. 
  ASU No. 2016-05,   Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships     The amendments in this update clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses   (Topic 326) ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 requires more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other such commitments. ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require the Company to measure all expected credit losses based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets and eliminates the  incurred loss  methodology in current GAAP. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which is intended to address diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues as well as application of the predominance principle (dependence on predominant source or use of receipt or payment) and are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted.  
   
  NOTE 4   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  GAAP defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. GAAP emphasizes that fair value is intended to be a market-based measurement, as opposed to a transaction-specific measurement.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate the fair value. Assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy, as follows: 
  Level 1   Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
  Level 2   Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active (markets with few transactions), inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs). 
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs, which are only used to the extent that observable inputs are not available, reflect the Company s assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability. 
  The following describes the methods the Company uses to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities: 
  Line of credit and notes payable     The fair value is estimated by discounting the expected cash flows based on estimated borrowing rates available to the Company as of the measurement date. The estimated fair value of the Company s debt was   $120.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which approximated the carrying value on that date. As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the Company s debt was   $119.3 million   compared to a carrying value on that date of   $119.5 million  . The fair value of the Company s debt is estimated using Level 2 inputs. 
  Marketable securities     The Company s marketable securities are carried at fair value and are valued using Level 1 inputs. The estimated fair value of the Company s marketable securities are based on quoted market prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market. 
  Derivative instruments     The Company s derivative instruments are comprised of interest rate swaps. All derivative instruments are carried at fair value and are valued using Level 2 inputs. The fair value of these instruments is determined using interest rate market pricing models. In addition, credit valuation adjustments are incorporated into the fair values to account for the Company s potential nonperformance risk and the performance risk of the respective counterparties. 
  Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with those derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. However, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the Company s derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Other financial instruments           The Company considers the carrying values of its cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other liabilities, due to affiliates and distributions payable in order to approximate their fair values because of the short period of time between their origination and their expected realization as well as their highly-liquid nature. Due to the short-term maturities of these instruments, Level 1 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. 
  Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize, or be liable for, upon disposition of the financial assets and liabilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between fair value hierarchy levels.

In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers a variety of factors, including (1) whether the Company has the intent to sell the impaired security, (2) whether the Company expects to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value, and (3) whether the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company believes that none of the unrealized losses on investment securities are other-than-temporary as management expects the Company will fully recover the entire amortized cost basis of all securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no other-than-temporary impairment losses. 
   
  NOTE 7   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
  In the normal course of business, the Company uses certain types of derivative instruments for the purpose of managing or hedging its interest rate risk. The Company did not enter into any interest rate swap agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The following table summarizes the terms of the Company s executed interest rate swap agreements designated as hedging instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):    

  ______________________ 
  (1)  The interest rates consist of the underlying index swapped to a fixed rate and the applicable interest rate spread as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Additional disclosures related to the fair value of the Company s derivative instruments are included in Note 4 to these condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. The notional amount under the interest rate swap agreements is an indication of the extent of the Company s involvement in each instrument, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks. 
  Accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. The Company designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in order to hedge the variability of the anticipated cash flows on its variable rate debt. The change in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instruments that are designated as hedges is recorded in other comprehensive loss, with a portion of the amount subsequently reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable rate debt. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the amounts reclassified were   $131,000   and   $405,000  , respectively. The amount reclassified for both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   $137,000  . 
  Any ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in interest expense. There were no portions of the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps that were considered ineffective during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. During the next 12 months, the Company estimates that an additional   $426,000   will be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) as an increase to interest expense. 
  The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain provisions whereby, if the Company defaults on certain of its unsecured indebtedness, the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations, resulting in an acceleration of payment. If the Company had breached any of these provisions, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at an aggregate termination value, inclusive of interest payments, of   $1.1 million  , which includes accrued interest, at   September 30, 2016  . In addition, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The Company records credit risk valuation adjustments on its interest rate swaps based on the credit quality of the Company and the respective counterparty. There were no termination events or events of default related to the interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016  .

NOTE 8   CREDIT FACILITY AND NOTES PAYABLE 
           As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $119.1 million   of debt outstanding, including net deferred financing costs, with weighted average years to maturity of   4.9   years and a weighted average interest rate of   3.66%  . The following table summarizes the debt balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and the debt activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

______________________ 
  (1)  Includes deferred financing costs incurred during the period. 
  (2)  Deferred costs relate to mortgage notes payable and the term portion of the Credit Facility. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had fixed rate debt outstanding of   $80.8 million  , including   $9.2 million   of variable rate debt that is fixed through interest rate swap agreements, which has the effect of fixing the variable interest rate per annum through the maturity of the variable rate debt. The fixed rate debt has interest rates ranging from   3.37%   to   4.05%   per annum and as of   September 30, 2016  , the fixed rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of   3.77%  . The fixed rate debt outstanding matures on various dates from December 2020 to February 2025. The aggregate balance of gross real estate assets, net of gross intangible lease liabilities, securing the fixed rate debt outstanding was   $134.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Each of the mortgage notes payable comprising the fixed rate debt is secured by the respective properties on which the debt was placed. 
  The Company has an amended and restated credit agreement (the  Amended Credit Agreement ) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent ( JPMorgan Chase ), that provides for borrowings up to   $125.0 million  , which as of   September 30, 2016   was comprised of   $85.0 million   in revolving loans (the  Revolving Loans ), and a   $40.0 million   term loan (the  Term Loan ), collectively, the credit facility (the  Credit Facility ). The Term Loan matures on September 12, 2019 and the Revolving Loans mature on September 12, 2017; however, the Company may elect to extend the maturity date for the Revolving Loans to September 12, 2019, subject to satisfying certain conditions described in the Amended Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 12   Subsequent Events for changes to the amended credit agreement which occurred subsequent to   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Credit Facility bears interest at rates dependent upon the type of loan specified by the Company and the overall leverage ratio. For a eurodollar rate loan, the interest rate will be equal to the one-month, two-month, three-month or six-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) for the interest period, as elected by the Company, multiplied by the statutory reserve rate, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement (the  Eurodollar Rate ), plus an interest rate spread ranging from   1.90%   to   2.45%  . For base rate committed loans, the interest rate will be equal to a rate ranging from   0.90%   to   1.45%  , depending on the Company s leverage ratio as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, plus the greatest of: (a) JPMorgan Chase s Prime Rate; (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) plus   0.50%  ; and (c) one-month LIBOR multiplied by the statutory reserve rate plus   1.0%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   amounts outstanding under the Revolving Loans, and the amount of the Term Loan outstanding totaled   $40.0 million  , which was subject to an interest rate swap agreement (the  Swapped Term Loan ). As of   September 30, 2016  , the all-in rate for the Swapped Term Loan was   3.43%  . The Company had   $85.0 million   in unused capacity, subject to borrowing availability, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, borrowing conditions and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including minimum net worth, debt service coverage and leverage ratio requirements and dividend payout and REIT status requirements. In particular, the Amended Credit Agreement includes a requirement for the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth greater than or equal to the sum of (i)   $63.0 million   plus (ii)   75%   of the issuance of equity from the date of the Credit Agreement, a leverage ratio less than or equal to   60.0%   and a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than   1.50  . The Amended Credit Agreement also includes usual and customary events of default and remedies for facilities of this nature. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company believes it was in compliance with the covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement.

In addition, the Company may own or acquire certain properties that are subject to environmental remediation. Generally, the seller of the property, the tenant of the property and/or another third party is responsible for environmental remediation costs related to a property. Additionally, in connection with the purchase of certain properties, the respective sellers and/or tenants may agree to indemnify the Company against future remediation costs. The Company also carries environmental liability insurance on its properties that provides limited coverage for any remediation liability and/or pollution liability for third-party bodily injury and/or property damage claims for which the Company may be liable.  The Company is not aware of any environmental matters which it believes are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
   
  NOTE 10   RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS 
  The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, commissions, fees and expenses payable to Cole Advisors and certain of its affiliates in connection with the Offering, and the acquisition, management and performance of the Company s assets.  
  Selling commissions, dealer manager and distribution fees 
  In connection with the Offering, CCC, the Company s dealer manager, will receive selling commissions, an asset-based dealer manager fee and/or an asset-based distribution fee, as summarized in the table below for each class of common stock:    

  ______________________ 
  (1) The selling commission is based on the offering price for A Shares. The selling commission expressed as a percentage of NAV per A Share, rather than the offering price, is up to   3.90%  , subject to rounding and the effect of volume discounts the Company is offering on certain purchases of   $150,001   or more of A Shares. Selling commissions are deducted directly from the offering price for A Shares and paid to CCC. The Company has been advised that CCC intends to reallow   100%   of the selling commissions on A Shares to participating broker-dealers.  
  (2) The dealer manager and distribution fees will be calculated on a daily basis in an amount equal to 1/365th of the percentage of NAV per W Share, A Share or I Share, as applicable, for such day on a continuous basis. CCC, in its sole discretion, may reallow a portion of the dealer manager fee and distribution fee to participating broker-dealers.

Other organization and offering expenses 
  All other organization and offering expenses associated with the sale of the Company s common stock (excluding selling commissions, the distribution fee and the dealer manager fee) are paid for by Cole Advisors or its affiliates and can be reimbursed by the Company up to   0.75%   of the aggregate gross offering proceeds, excluding selling commissions charged on A Shares sold in the Primary Offering. As of   September 30, 2016  , Cole Advisors or its affiliates had paid organization and offering expenses in excess of the   0.75%   in connection with the Offering. These excess amounts were not included in the financial statements of the Company because such amounts were not a liability of the Company as they exceeded   0.75%   of gross proceeds from the Offering. As the Company raises additional proceeds from the Offering, these excess amounts may become payable to Cole Advisors. 
  Advisory fees and expenses 
  The Company pays Cole Advisors an asset-based advisory fee that is payable in arrears on a monthly basis and accrues daily in an amount equal to   1/365th   of   0.90%   of the Company s NAV for each class of common stock, for each day. 
  Operating expenses 
  The Company reimburses Cole Advisors for the operating expenses it paid or incurred in connection with the services provided to the Company, subject to the limitation that the Company will not reimburse for any amount by which its operating expenses (including the advisory fee) at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceeds the greater of (1)   2%   of average invested assets, or (2)   25%   of net income other than any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period.  
  Expense Cap 
  Cole Advisors had an expense cap in place from October 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, whereby Cole Advisors funded all general and administrative expenses of the Company that were in excess of an amount calculated by multiplying the average NAV for the respective three month period by an annualized rate of   1.25%   (the  Excess G A ). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred   $264,000   and   $485,000   of Excess G A which was reimbursed by Cole Advisors subsequent to September 30, 2015. Beginning January 1, 2016, Cole Advisors no longer funded Excess G A. 
  Acquisition fees and expenses 
  In addition, the Company reimburses Cole Advisors for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Company s investments. While most of the acquisition expenses are expected to be paid to third parties, a portion of the out-of-pocket acquisition expenses may be reimbursed to Cole Advisors or its affiliates. Acquisition expenses, together with any acquisition fees paid to third parties for a particular real estate-related asset, will in no event exceed   6%   of the gross purchase price of such asset. 
  Performance Fee 
  As compensation for services provided pursuant to the advisory agreement, the Company will also pay Cole Advisors a performance-based fee calculated based on the Company s annual total return to stockholders for each class of common stock (defined below), payable annually in arrears. The performance fee will be calculated such that for any calendar year in which the total return per share for a particular class exceeds   6%   (the    6%   Return ), Cole Advisors will receive   25%   of the excess total return on such class above the   6%   Return allocable to that class, but in no event will the Company pay Cole Advisors more than   10%   of the aggregate total return, for that class, for such year. However, in the event the NAV per share of the Company s W Shares, A Shares and I Shares decreases below the base NAV for the respective share class (  $15.00  ,   $16.72   and   $16.82   for the W Shares, A Shares and I Shares, respectively) (the  Base NAV ), the performance-based fee for a respective class will not be calculated on any increase in NAV up to the Base NAV for the respective share class. In addition, the performance fee will not be paid with respect to any calendar year in which the NAV per share as of the last business day of the calendar year (the  Ending NAV ) for the respective share class is less than the Base NAV of that class. The Base NAV of any share class is subject to downward adjustment in the event that the Company s board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors, determines that such an adjustment is necessary to provide an appropriate incentive to Cole Advisors to perform in a manner that seeks to maximize stockholder value and is in the best interests of the Company s stockholders. In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization or similar change in the Company s capital structure, the Base NAV for the respective share class shall be ratably adjusted to reflect the effect of any such event.

The total return to stockholders is defined, for each class of the Company s common stock, as the change in NAV per share plus distributions per share for such class. The NAV per share for a class calculated on the last trading day of a calendar year shall be the amount against which changes in NAV per share for such class are measured during the subsequent calendar year. Therefore, for each class of the Company s common stock, payment of the performance-based component of the advisory fee (1) is contingent upon the Company s actual annual total return exceeding the   6%   Return and the Ending NAV per share for the respective share class being greater than the Base NAV of that class, (2) will vary in amount based on the Company s actual performance, (3) cannot cause the Company s total return as a percentage of stockholders  invested capital for the year to be reduced below   6%   and (4) is payable to Cole Advisors if the Company s total return exceeds the   6%   Return in a particular calendar year, even if the total return to stockholders (or any particular stockholder) on a cumulative basis over any longer or shorter period has been less than   6%   per annum. Cole Advisors will not be obligated to return any portion of advisory fees paid based on the Company s subsequent performance. The Company did not reach the   6%   Return during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company incurred commissions, fees and expense reimbursements as shown in the table below for services provided by Cole Advisors and its affiliates related to the services described above during the periods indicated (in thousands):   

  ______________________ 
  (1) Amounts are calculated for the respective period in accordance with the dealer manager agreement and exclude the estimated liability for the future dealer manager and distribution fees payable to CCC, which are included in due to affiliates in the condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets, with a corresponding decrease to capital in excess of par value, as described in Note 3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
  Due to Affiliates 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $13.3 million   and   $8.2 million  , respectively, was due to Cole Advisors or its affiliates primarily related to the estimated liability for current and future dealer manager and distribution fees, advisory fees, the reimbursement of organization and offering expenses, and acquisition expenses and were included in due to affiliates on the condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets. 
   
           NOTE 11   
     ECONOMIC DEPENDENCY 
     Under various agreements, the Company has engaged or will engage Cole Advisors or its affiliates to provide certain services that are essential to the Company, including asset management services, supervision of the management and leasing of properties owned by the Company, asset acquisition and disposition decisions, the sale of shares of the Company s common stock available for issuance, as well as other administrative responsibilities for the Company including accounting services and investor relations. As a result of these relationships, the Company is dependent upon Cole Advisors or its affiliates. In the event that these companies are unable to provide the Company with these services, the Company would be required to find alternative providers of these services.

  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Cole Real Estate Income Strategy (Daily NAV), Inc., other than historical facts may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as applicable by law. Such statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and prospects and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as well as known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated. Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as  may,   would,   could,   should,   expect,   intend,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue  or other similar words. Forward-looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false.

Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to: 
             
    changes in economic conditions generally and the real estate and securities markets specifically; 
                
    the effect of financial leverage, including changes in interest rates, availability of credit, loss of flexibility due to negative and affirmative covenants, refinancing risk at maturity and generally the increased risk of loss if our investments fail to perform as expected; 
                
    our ability to raise a substantial amount of capital in the near term; 
                
    our ability to access sources of liquidity when we have the need to fund redemptions of common stock in excess of the proceeds from the sales of shares of our common stock in our continuous offering and the consequential risk that we may not have the resources to satisfy redemption requests; 
                
    our ability to effectively deploy the proceeds raised in our public offering;

     Definitions 
  We use certain defined terms throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have the following meanings: 
  The phrase  annualized rental income,  refers to the straight line rental revenue under our leases on operating properties owned as of the respective reporting date, which includes the effect of rent escalations and any tenant concessions, such as free rent, and excludes any bad debt allowances and any contingent rent, such as percentage rent. Management uses annualized rental income as a basis for tenant, industry and geographic concentrations and other metrics within the portfolio. Annualized rental income is not indicative of future performance.

Under a  net lease,  the tenant occupying the leased property (usually as a single tenant) does so in much the same manner as if the tenant were the owner of the property. There are various forms of net leases, most typically classified as triple net or double net. Triple net leases typically require the tenant to pay all expenses associated with the property (  e.g.  , real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs). Double net leases typically require that the tenant pay all operating expenses associated with the property (  e.g.  , real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance), but excludes some or all major repairs (  e.g.  , roof, structure and parking lot). Accordingly, the owner receives the rent  net  of these expenses, rendering the cash flow associated with the lease predictable for the term of the lease. Under a net lease, the tenant generally agrees to lease the property for a significant term and agrees that it will either have no ability or only limited ability to terminate the lease or abate rent prior to the expiration of the term of the lease as a result of real estate driven events such as casualty, condemnation or failure by the landlord to fulfill its obligations under the lease. 
  Overview 
  We were formed on July 27, 2010 to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio of (1) necessity retail, office and industrial properties that are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term net leases, and are strategically located throughout the United States and U.S. protectorates, (2) notes receivable secured by commercial real estate, including the origination of loans, and (3) cash, cash equivalents, other short-term investments and traded real estate securities. We commenced our principal operations on December 7, 2011, when we issued the initial   $10.0 million   in shares of our common stock in the Offering and acquired our first real estate property. We have no paid employees and are externally advised and managed by Cole Advisors.  
  VEREIT indirectly owns and/or controls Cole Advisors, our dealer manager, CCC, our property manager, CREI Advisors, and our sponsor, Cole Capital.  
  As we acquire additional commercial real estate, we will be subject to changes in real estate prices and changes in interest rates on any current variable rate debt, refinancings or new indebtedness used to acquire the properties. We may manage our risk of changes in real estate prices on future property acquisitions, when applicable, by entering into purchase agreements and loan commitments simultaneously, or through loan assumptions, so that our operating yield is determinable at the time we enter into a purchase agreement, by contracting with developers for future delivery of properties, or by entering into sale-leaseback transactions. We manage our interest rate risk by monitoring the interest rate environment in connection with our future property acquisitions, when applicable, or upcoming debt maturities to determine the appropriate financing or refinancing terms, which may include fixed rate loans, variable rate loans or interest rate hedges. If we are unable to acquire suitable properties or obtain suitable financing terms for future acquisitions or refinancing, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
  Our operating results and cash flows are primarily influenced by rental income from our commercial properties, interest expense on our indebtedness and acquisition and operating expenses. Rental and other property income accounted for   89%   and   88%   of our total revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   89%   and   91%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As   99.2%   of our rentable square feet was under lease as of   September 30, 2016   with a weighted average remaining lease term of   11.0   years, we believe our exposure to changes in commercial rental rates on our portfolio is substantially mitigated, except for vacancies caused by tenant bankruptcies or other factors. Cole Advisors regularly monitors the creditworthiness of our tenants by reviewing each tenant s financial results, credit rating agency reports, when available, on the tenant or guarantor, the operating history of the property with such tenant, the tenant s market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant s industry segment, and other information for changes and possible trends. If our advisor identifies significant changes or trends that may adversely affect the creditworthiness of a tenant, it will gather a more in-depth knowledge of the tenant s financial condition and, if necessary, attempt to mitigate the tenant credit risk by evaluating the possible sale of the property or identifying a possible replacement tenant should the current tenant fail to perform on the lease.

Portfolio Information 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   96   properties located in   31   states, comprising   2.6 million   rentable square feet of commercial space, which includes the rentable square feet of buildings on land subject to ground leases. As of   September 30, 2016  , no single tenant accounted for greater than   10%   of our   2016   annualized rental income. We had certain geographic concentrations in our property holdings. In particular, as of   September 30, 2016  ,   nine   of our properties were located in   Ohio  , and   five   of our properties were located in   Illinois  , each state accounting for   10%   of our   2016   annualized rental income. In addition, we had tenants in the   discount store  ,   drugstore  ,   home furnishing    and   grocery store   industries accounted for   14%  ,   11%  ,   10%  , and   10%   respectively, of our   2016   annualized rental income. Our results of operations are influenced by the timing of acquisitions and the operating performance of our real estate investments. The following table shows the property statistics of our real estate assets as of   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  :

Revenues 
  Our revenues consist primarily of rental and other property income from net leased commercial properties. We also pay certain operating expenses subject to reimbursement by our tenants, which results in tenant reimbursement income. Additionally, our portfolio includes liquid assets in the form of marketable securities. These investments can result in revenue in the form of interest income. 
    The   increase   in revenue of   $2.1 million   and   $5.0 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to the acquisition of   23   rental income-producing properties subsequent to   September 30, 2015  . Rental and other property income accounted for   89%   and   88%   of our total revenues for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   89%   and   91%   of our total revenues for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We also paid certain operating expenses subject to reimbursement by our tenants, which resulted in   $697,000   and   $1.9 million   in tenant reimbursement income during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $547,000   and   $1.2 million   during the same periods in   2015  . Interest income on marketable securities of   $29,000   and   $88,000   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively,   increased   due to an increase in the average outstanding investment in marketable securities of   $2.9 million  , compared to   $28,000   and   $48,000   during the same periods in   2015  . 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  The primary general and administrative expense items are advisory fees, professional, accounting and legal fees, escrow and trustee fees, unused line of credit fees and state franchise and income taxes. 
  The   increase   in general and administrative expenses of   $874,000   and   $2.2 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to an increase in advisor reimbursements as Cole Advisors no longer funded Excess G A in 2016. 
  Property Operating Expenses 
  Property operating expenses such as property repairs, maintenance and property related insurance include both reimbursable and non-reimbursable property expenses. We are reimbursed by tenants for reimbursable property operating expenses in accordance with the respective lease agreements.  
  The   increase   in property operating expenses of   $77,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was due to owning   90   properties during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and acquiring   six   additional properties during the period, compared to owning   72   properties during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , and acquiring   two   and disposing of   one   property during such period.  
  The   increase   in property operating expenses of   $189,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was due to owning   77   properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and acquiring   19   additional properties during such period, compared to owning   74   properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , and acquiring   three   and disposing of   five   properties during such period. 
  Real Estate Tax Expenses 
  The   increase   in real estate tax expenses of   $122,000   and   $677,000   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to real estate taxes incurred on 23 additional properties acquired subsequent to   September 30, 2015   and an increase in assessments at several of the properties owned in comparable periods. 
  Advisory Fees and Expenses 
  The advisory fees and expenses that we pay to our advisor are based upon our NAV. 
  The   increase   in advisory fees and expenses of   $32,000   and   $225,000   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to an increase in our total NAV for each share class resulting from the issuance of common stock subsequent to   September 30, 2015   and the overall increase in property values since   September 30, 2015  . 
  Acquisition-Related Expenses 
  The   increase   in acquisition-related expenses of   $555,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was due to the acquisition of   six   commercial properties for an aggregate purchase price of   $44.0 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the purchase of   two   commercial properties for an aggregate purchase price of   $6.5 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .

  The   increase   in depreciation and amortization of   $844,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was due to owning   90   properties during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and acquiring   six   additional properties during such period, compared to owning   72   properties during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , and acquiring   two   and disposing of   one   property during such period. 
  The   increase   in depreciation and amortization of   $1.9 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was due to owning   77   properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and acquiring   19   additional properties during such period, compared to owning   74   properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , and acquiring   three   and disposing of   five   properties during such period. 
  Interest Expense and Other, Net 
  The   increase   in interest expense and other, net of   $174,000   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to the addition of two notes payable subsequent to   September 30, 2015   of $20.5 million, in addition to an increase in the weighted average interest rate from   3.19%   to   3.66%  . 
  The   increase   in interest expense and other, net of   $885,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to the addition of two notes payable subsequent to   September 30, 2015   of $20.5 million, in addition to an increase in the weighted average interest rate from   3.19%   to   3.66%  . 
  Gain on Disposition of Real Estate, Net 
  The   decrease   in gain on disposition of real estate, net of   $964,000   and   $5.6 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, was due to the disposition of   one   property and five properties during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. No dispositions occurred during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

Same Store Properties 
  We review our stabilized operating results, measured by contract rental revenue, from properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods, referred to as  same store  properties. Contract rental revenue is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies  operating performance. Contract rental revenue is considered by management to be a helpful supplemental performance measure, as it provides a consistent method for the comparison of our properties. In determining the same store property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entirety of both the current and prior reporting periods, except for properties during the current or prior year that were under development or redevelopment.  
   Non-same store,  for the purposes of the   three   month comparison table below, includes properties acquired on or after   July 1, 2015  . As shown in the table below, contract rental revenue on the   71   same store properties for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   increased   0.2%  , compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The same store properties were   99.5%   occupied as of   September 30, 2016   and   99.6%   occupied as of   September 30, 2015  . The following table shows the contract rental revenue from properties owned for both of the entire   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , along with a reconciliation to rental income, calculated in accordance with GAAP (dollar amounts in thousands):

  (1) We disposed of one property during the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
  (2) Includes amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles and deferred lease incentives. 
   Non-same store,  for the purposes of the   nine   month comparison table below, includes properties acquired on or after January 1, 2015. As shown in the table below, contract rental revenue on the   70   same store properties for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased   0.2%  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The same store properties were   99.5%   occupied as of   September 30, 2016   and   99.6%   occupied as of   September 30, 2015  . The following table shows the contract rental revenue from properties owned for both of the entire   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , along with a reconciliation to rental income, calculated in accordance with GAAP (dollar amounts in thousands):

Distributions 
  Our board of directors authorized a daily distribution of   $0.002678083   per share for stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on   January 1, 2016   and ending on March 31, 2017. The daily distribution amount for each class of outstanding common stock is adjusted based on the relative NAV of the various classes each day so that, from day to day, distributions constitute a uniform percentage of the NAV per share of all classes. As a result, from day to day, the per share daily distribution for each outstanding class of common stock may be higher or lower than the daily distribution amount authorized by our board of directors based on the relative NAV of each class of common stock on that day. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we paid distributions of   $8.6 million   and   $5.5 million  , respectively, including   $4.1 million   and   $2.4 million  , respectively, through the issuance of shares pursuant to the DRIP. Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $6.1 million   and   $5.9 million  , respectively, and reflected a reduction for real estate acquisition-related expenses incurred of   $1.7 million   and    $217,000  , respectively. We treat our real estate acquisition-related expenses as funded by proceeds from the Offering, including proceeds from the DRIP. Therefore, for consistency, proceeds from the issuance of common stock used as a source of distributions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   includes the amount by which real estate acquisition-related expenses reduced net cash flows from operating activities in those periods of   $1.7 million   and   $217,000  , respectively. The distributions paid during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, were covered by cash flows from operating activities, including cash flows from operating activities from prior periods of   $7.8 million   or   90%   and proceeds from the Offering of   $867,000   or   10%  . The distributions paid during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, were fully covered by cash flows from operating activities, including cash flows from operating activities from prior periods. 
  Share Redemptions 
  We have adopted a share redemption plan to provide limited liquidity whereby, on each business day, stockholders may request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares, subject to a minimum redemption amount and certain short-term trading fees. The redemption price per share for each class on any business day will be our NAV per share for such class for that day, calculated by the independent fund accountant in accordance with our valuation policies. 
  Our share redemption plan includes certain redemption limits, including a quarterly limit and, in some cases, an individual stockholder limit. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we received redemption requests for, and redeemed, a total of approximately   625,000   shares of our common stock for   $11.4 million  , comprised of approximately   547,000   W Shares and   78,000   A Shares of our common stock for   $10.0 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively. From   September 30, 2016   through   November 7, 2016  , we redeemed approximately   147,000   shares for   $2.7 million  . 
  We intend to fund share redemptions with available cash, proceeds from our liquid investments and proceeds from sales of additional shares. We may, after taking the interests of our Company as a whole and the interests of our remaining stockholders into consideration, use proceeds from any available sources at our disposal to satisfy redemption requests, including, but not limited to, proceeds from sales of additional shares, excess cash flow from operations, sales of our liquid investments, incurrence of indebtedness and, if necessary, proceeds from the disposition of real estate properties. In an effort to have adequate cash available to support our share redemption plan, Cole Advisors may determine to reserve borrowing capacity under the Line of Credit. Cole Advisors could then elect to borrow against the Line of Credit in part to redeem shares presented for redemption during periods when we do not have sufficient proceeds from the sale of shares in the Offering to fund all redemption requests. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  General 
   We expect to continue to raise capital through the Offering and to utilize such funds along with future proceeds from secured or unsecured financing to complete future property acquisitions and for general corporate uses. Our operating cash flows primarily are driven by the rental income received from current and future leased properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had raised   $313.8 million   of gross proceeds from the Offering before offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution fees of   $7.5 million  . Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for risks related to our ability to raise capital in the near term. 
  Our Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, provides for borrowings up to $125.0 million, which is comprised of $85.0 million in revolving loans and a $40.0 million term loan, collectively, the credit facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $85.0 million   in unused capacity, subject to borrowing availability. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $25.0 million  .

     Table of Contents  

Our investment guidelines provide that we will target the following aggregate allocation to relatively liquid investments, such as U.S. government securities, agency securities, corporate debt, publicly traded debt and equity real estate-related securities, cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments and, in Cole Advisors  discretion, lines of credit (collectively, the  Liquid Assets ): (1) 10% of our NAV up to $1.0 billion and (2) 5% of our NAV in excess of $1.0 billion. To the extent that Cole Advisors elects to maintain borrowing capacity under lines of credit, the amount available under the lines of credit will be included in calculating the Liquid Assets under these guidelines. These are guidelines, and our stockholders should not expect that we will, at all times, hold liquid assets at or above the target levels or that all liquid assets will be available to satisfy redemption requests as we receive them. We anticipate that both our overall allocation to liquid assets as a percentage of our NAV and our allocation to different types of liquid assets will vary. In making these determinations our advisor will consider our receipt of proceeds from sales of additional shares, our cash flow from operations, available borrowing capacity under lines of credit, if any, or from additional mortgages on our real estate, our receipt of proceeds from sales of assets, and the anticipated use of cash to fund redemptions, as well as the availability and pricing of different investments. The amount of the Liquid Assets is determined by our advisor, in its sole discretion, but is subject to review by our independent directors on a quarterly basis. 
  Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for acquisitions, operating expenses, distributions and redemptions to stockholders and interest on our outstanding debt. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash, cash provided by property operations, proceeds from the Offering and borrowings from the Line of Credit or other sources.  
  The Term Loan matures on September 12, 2019 and the Revolving Loans mature on September 12, 2017; however, we may elect to extend the maturity date for the Revolving Loans to September 12, 2019, subject to satisfying certain conditions described in the Amended Credit Agreement. As a result, we believe that the resources identified above will be sufficient to satisfy our short-term operating requirements, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from sources other than those described above within the next 12 months. 
  Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds are for property and other asset acquisitions and the payment of tenant improvements, operating expenses, including debt service payments on any outstanding indebtedness, and distributions and redemptions to our stockholders. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through proceeds from the Offering, secured or unsecured financings from banks and other lenders, any available capacity on the Line of Credit by the addition of properties to the borrowing base, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and net cash flows provided by operations. 
  We expect that substantially all net cash flows from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after certain capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, are paid; however, we may use other sources to fund distributions, as necessary, including proceeds from the Offering, borrowings on the Line of Credit and/or future borrowings on our unencumbered assets. To the extent that cash flows from operations are lower due to fewer properties being acquired or lower than expected returns on the properties, distributions paid to our stockholders may be lower. We expect that substantially all net cash flows from the Offering or debt financings will be used to fund acquisitions, certain capital expenditures, repayments of outstanding debt or distributions to our stockholders. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $120.8 million   of debt outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of   3.66%  . See Note 8 - Credit Facility and Notes Payable to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of certain terms of our debt.

     Table of Contents  

Our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands):   

  ______________________ 
           (1) 
    The table does not include amounts due to our advisor or its affiliates pursuant to our advisory agreement because such amounts are not fixed and determinable. 
              (2) 
    Does not include the impact of any extension. We may elect to extend the maturity of the Revolving Loans to September 12, 2019, subject to satisfying certain conditions described in the Amended Credit Agreement. 
              (3) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $9.2 million   of variable rate mortgage notes and   $40.0 million   of variable rate debt on the Credit Facility effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements. We used the effective interest rates fixed under our swap agreements to calculate the debt payment obligations in future periods. 
     Our charter prohibits us from incurring debt that would cause our borrowings to exceed   75%   of our gross assets, valued at the aggregate cost (before depreciation and other non-cash reserves), unless approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report. In addition to this limitation in our charter, our board of directors has adopted a policy to further limit our borrowings to 60% of the greater of cost (before depreciation or other non-cash reserves) or fair market value of our gross assets; provided however, that a majority of our board of directors (including a majority of the independent directors) has determined that, as a general policy, borrowing in excess of 60% of the greater of cost (before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves) or fair market value of our gross assets was justified and in the best interest of us and our stockholders during our capital raising stage. The independent directors believe such borrowing levels are justified as higher debt levels during the offering stage may enable us to acquire properties earlier than we might otherwise be able to acquire them if we were to adhere to the 60% debt limitation, which could yield returns that are accretive to the portfolio. In addition, as we are in the offering stage, more equity could be raised in the future to reduce the debt levels. As of   September 30, 2016  , our ratio of debt to total gross real estate assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities was   34.3%  . 
  Our management reviews net debt as part of its management of our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage, and we therefore believe that the presentation of net debt provides useful information to investors. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure used to show our outstanding principal debt balance, excluding certain GAAP adjustments, such as financing and issuance costs and related accumulated amortization, less all cash and cash equivalents. As of   September 30, 2016  , our net debt leverage ratio, which is the ratio of net debt to total gross real estate assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities, was   27.2%  . The following table provides a reconciliation of the credit facility and notes payable, net balance, as reported on our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet, to net debt as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):   

  ______________________ 
  (1) Net of gross intangible lease liabilities. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had entered into purchase agreements with unaffiliated third-party sellers to acquire a 100% interest in   five   retail properties, subject to meeting certain criteria, for an aggregate purchase price of   $59.3 million  , exclusive of closing costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.2 million   of property escrow deposits held by escrow agents in connection with these future property acquisitions. These deposits are included in the condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets in property escrow deposits, prepaid expenses and other assets in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of these escrow deposits have been forfeited.

Cash Flow Analysis 
  Operating Activities.   Net cash   provided by   operating activities was   $6.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $5.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to an increase in our working capital balances of   $842,000  , offset by a decrease in net income before non-cash adjustments for depreciation, amortization of intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs, and amortization of discounts on marketable securities of   $694,000  . See    Results of Operations  for a more complete discussion of the factors impacting our operating performance. 
  Investing Activities.   Net cash   used in   investing activities   increased     $96.4 million   to   $87.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net cash provided by investing activities of   $8.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to the acquisition of   19   commercial properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to having acquired   three   properties during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Financing Activities.   Net cash   provided by   financing activities   increased     $97.7 million   to   $92.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net cash used in financing activities of   $5.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to an   increase   in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of   $79.0 million   and an increase in net proceeds from borrowing facilities and notes payable of   $21.3 million  , offset by an   increase   in redemptions of common stock of   $2.0 million  . 
  Election as a REIT 
  From the date of our formation until the day following the date on which we issued shares to stockholders other than Cole Holdings Corporation ( CHC ), a former affiliate of our sponsor, we were a qualified subchapter S subsidiary of CHC, and therefore were disregarded as an entity separate from CHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have elected to be taxed and currently qualify, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain requirements relating to our organization, sources of income, nature of assets, distributions of income to our stockholders and recordkeeping. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders so long as we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding certain non-cash items and net capital gains). 
  If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT for any reason in a taxable year and applicable relief provisions do not apply, we will be subject to tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We will not be able to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders in any year in which we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We also will be disqualified for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. No provision for federal income taxes has been made in our accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. We are subject to certain state and local taxes related to the operations of properties in certain locations, which have been provided for in our accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We consider our critical accounting policies to be the following: 
             
    Recoverability of Real Estate Assets; 
     
   33 

     Table of Contents  

Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets; and 
                
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 
     A complete description of such policies and our considerations is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2015 and related notes thereto. 
  Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
  We have entered into agreements with Cole Advisors and its affiliates whereby we will pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, Cole Advisors or its affiliates, primarily advisory and performance fees and expenses, organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees and expenses, distribution fees, and the reimbursement of certain acquisition and operating costs. See Note 10 to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further explanation of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees. 
  Conflicts of Interest 
  Affiliates of Cole Advisors act as an advisor to, and our chief financial officer and our chief executive officer act as executive officers and/or directors of Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc., Cole Credit Property Trust V, Inc., Cole Office   Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc., Cole Office   Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc., and/or other real estate offerings in registration, all of which are REITs offered, distributed and/or managed by affiliates of Cole Advisors. As such, there are conflicts of interest where Cole Advisors or its affiliates, while serving in the capacity as sponsor, general partner, officer, director, key personnel and/or advisor for VEREIT or another real estate program sponsored by Cole Capital, including other real estate offerings in registration, may be in conflict with us in connection with providing services to other real estate related programs related to property acquisitions, property dispositions, and property management among others. The compensation arrangements between affiliates of Cole Advisors and VEREIT and these other real estate programs sponsored by Cole Capital could influence the advice provided to us. See Part I, Item 1. Business   Conflicts of Interest in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. 
   
           Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     In connection with the acquisition of our properties, we may, from time to time, obtain variable rate debt financing, and may therefore be exposed to changes in LIBOR. In the future, our objectives in managing interest rate risks will be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on operations and cash flows, and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we expect to borrow primarily at interest rates with the lowest margins available and, in some cases, with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates. In addition, we expect that we may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and rate lock arrangements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk. To the extent we enter into such arrangements, we will be exposed to credit and market risks including, but not limited to, the failure of any counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract or the adverse effect on the value of the financial instrument resulting from a change in interest rates. We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no variable rate debt outstanding.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   two   interest rate swap agreements outstanding, which mature on   September 12, 2019   and   December 1, 2020  , with an aggregate notional amount of   $49.2 million   and an aggregate net fair value liability of   $1.0 million  , respectively. The fair value of these interest rate swap agreements is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads. As of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   50   basis points in interest rates would result in a change of   $751,000   to the fair value of the net derivative liability, resulting in a net derivative liability of   $283,000  . A decrease of   50   basis points in interest rates would result in a   $766,000   change to the fair value of the net derivative liability, resulting in a net derivative liability of   $1.8 million  . 
  We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.

    Controls and Procedures 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that no controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
  As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of   September 30, 2016   was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of   September 30, 2016  , were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
           Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
     In the ordinary course of business we may become subject to litigation or claims. We are not aware of any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, to which we are a party or to which our properties are the subject.  
   
           Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
     Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  We may pay some or all of our distributions, and fund some or all redemptions, from sources other than cash flow from operations, including borrowings by the REIT, proceeds from the offering of our securities or proceeds from asset sales, which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest and negatively impact the value of an investment in our common stock. 
  To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient to pay distributions or to fund redemptions, we may pay all or some of our distributions and fund all or some of our redemptions from borrowings by the REIT, proceeds from the offering of our securities or proceeds from the sale of assets, and we have no limits on the amounts we may pay from such other sources. The payment of distributions and redemptions from sources other than cash flow from operations may reduce the amount of capital we have available to invest in real estate, negatively impact the value of an investment in our common stock and reduce the overall return. We expect that, especially during the early stages of our development, as well as from time to time thereafter, we may declare distributions and/or fund redemptions that exceed our cash flows from operations. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we paid distributions of   $8.6 million   including   $4.1 million   through the issuance of shares pursuant to the DRIP. Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $6.1 million   and reflected a reduction for real estate acquisition-related expenses incurred of   $1.7 million  . We treat our real estate acquisition-related expenses as funded by proceeds from the Offering, including proceeds from the DRIP. Therefore, for consistency, proceeds from the issuance of common stock used as a source of distributions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   includes the amount by which real estate acquisition-related expenses reduced net cash flows from operating activities in those periods of   $1.7 million  . The distributions paid during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, were covered by cash flows from operating activities, including cash flows from operating activities from prior periods of   $7.8 million   or   90%   and proceeds from the Offering of   $867,000   or   10%  .  
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid distributions of $7.5 million, including $3.3 million through the issuance of shares pursuant to the DRIP. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $8.2 million and reflected a reduction for real estate acquisition-related expenses incurred of $809,000. The distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2015, including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, were fully covered by cash flows from operating activities. 
   
           Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
     On December 6, 2011, the Initial Registration Statement for our public offering of up to $4.0 billion in shares of common stock was declared effective under the Securities Act. The Initial Registration Statement covered up to $3.5 billion in shares in a primary offering and up to $500.0 million in shares pursuant to the DRIP. On December 7, 2011, we satisfied the conditions of our escrow agreement and accepted the initial subscription for 666,667 W Shares of our common stock in the offering under the Initial Registration Statement, at a price of $15.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $10.0 million. Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , we were authorized to issue 10.0 million shares of preferred stock, but none were issued or outstanding. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had issued approximately   17.8 million   shares in the Offering for gross proceeds of   $313.8 million  , out of which we have incurred   $5.2 million   in dealer manager fees, selling commissions and distribution fees and   $2.3 million   in organization and offering costs. With the net offering proceeds of   $306.3 million   and the borrowings from the credit facility, we acquired   $367.5 million   in real estate assets and incurred   $5.3 million   of acquisition-related expenses.

     Table of Contents  

As of   November 7, 2016  , we have sold the following common shares and raised the following proceeds in connection with the Offering (dollar amounts in thousands): 

We have adopted a share redemption plan to provide limited liquidity whereby, on a daily basis, stockholders may request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares. The redemption price per share for each class on any business day is equal to our NAV per share for such class for that day, calculated by the independent fund accountant after the close of business on the redemption request day, without giving effect to any share purchases or redemptions to be effected on such day. Subject to limited exceptions, stockholders who redeem their shares of our common stock within the first 365 days from the date of purchase are subject to a short-term trading fee of 2% of the aggregate NAV per share of the shares of common stock received. In each calendar quarter, net redemptions are limited under our share redemption plan to 5% of our total NAV as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter, plus any unused percentage carried over to the next quarter, but the maximum carryover percentage may never exceed 15% in the aggregate, and net redemptions in any quarter may never exceed 10% of the prior quarter s NAV. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we redeemed shares as follows:
