                                         Description of the Trust  

World
Monitor Trust III (the   Trust  ) is a business trust organized under the laws of Delaware on September 28, 2004.
The Trust consisted of four separate and distinct series (  Series  ): Series G, H, I and J. Series G, H, I and
J commenced operations on December 1, 2005. As of December 31, 2007, Series G, H and I were no longer offered and had been dissolved.
Series J will continue to exist unless terminated pursuant to the provisions of Article XIII of the Trust s Fifth Amended
and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the   Trust Agreement  ). The assets of each Series have
been segregated from those of the other Series, separately valued and independently managed, and separate financial statements
have been prepared for each Series. Each Series was formed to engage in the direct or indirect speculative trading of a diversified
portfolio of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and forward currency contracts and may, from time to time, engage
in cash and spot transactions. The fiscal year end of Series J is December 31.  

Kenmar
Preferred Investments, LLC (  Kenmar Preferred   or the   Managing Owner  ), a Delaware limited
liability company is the managing owner of the Trust and has been delegated administrative authority over the operations of the
Trust. As the Managing Owner of the Trust and of each Series, Kenmar Preferred conducts and manages the business of the Trust
and each Series.   

Clarity
Managed Account   Analytics Platform, LLC (  Clarity  ), an affiliate of Kenmar Preferred, serves as the managing
member for CTA Choice Fund LLC (  CTA Choice  ). CTA Choice is a Delaware limited liability company which consists
of multiple segregated series, each established pursuant to a separate Certificate of Designation prepared by Clarity. Each series
maintains separate and distinct records. The assets associated with each series, and the liabilities and obligations incurred
with respect to a particular series are enforceable only against the assets of that series.  

Kenmar
Global Investment Management, LLC (the   Asset Allocator  ), an affiliate of the Managing Owner, is the Asset Allocator
of CTA Choice. Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreements (formerly Asset Allocation Agreements) between the Managing Owner,
the Asset Allocator, and each interestholder, the Asset Allocator determines the trading level of each interestholder s assets
and reallocates among the separate series of CTA Choice as agreed upon with the Trading Advisors.  

Effective
December 31, 2015, Kenmar Global Investment Management, LLC was put into liquidation and Clarity was appointed as the Asset Allocator
of Series J. While the Asset Allocator receives no fees for such services from Series J, the Asset Allocator is paid management
and incentive fees directly from the interestholders pursuant to each interestholder s Asset Allocation Agreement. Series
J pays no management or incentive fees to the Asset Allocator.

Series
J allocates a portion of its net assets (  Allocated Assets  ) to commodity trading advisors (each, a   Trading
Advisor   and collectively, the   Trading Advisors  ) through various series of CTA Choice, for which such
allocations are rebalanced quarterly. As of September 30, 2016, Series J allocates approximately one-fourth of its Allocated Assets
to each Trading Advisor, which manages and makes trading decisions with respect to those Allocated Assets (see below table). The
Managing Owner may terminate any current Trading Advisor or select new trading advisors from time to time at its sole discretion
in order to achieve the goals of Series J. In the future, the Managing Owner may determine to access certain Trading Advisors
through separate investee pools.  

Each
Trading Advisor listed below is referred to herein as an   Affiliated Investment Fund   and collectively referred
to herein as the   Affiliated Investment Funds  :  

Series
J meets the definition of an investment company in accordance with guidance under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946
  Financial Services   Investment Companies  .  

B.    Regulation  

As
a registrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission (  SEC  ), the Trust and each Series are subject to the
regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  

As
a commodity pool, the Trust and each Series are subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (  CFTC  ),
an independent agency of the U.S. government which regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National
Futures Association (  NFA  ), an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of the various commodity
exchanges where the Trust, indirectly through the Affiliated Investment Funds, executes transactions.

                                         Offering  

Series
J offers units (the   Units  ) in two classes (each, a   Class  )   Class I and Class II.  

Up
to $281,250,000 Series J, Class I and $93,750,000 Series J, Class II Units are being offered (totaling $375,000,000) (  Subscription
Maximum  ). Units are being offered to investors who meet certain established suitability standards. Prior to November
30, 2008, investments required a minimum aggregate initial subscription of $5,000 and $2,000 for certain Benefit Plan Investors
(including IRAs), although the minimum purchase for any single series was $500.  

Effective
November 30, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Managing Owner of Series J determined that the Units would no longer be publicly
offered and would only be available on a private placement basis to  accredited investors  pursuant to Regulation D
under the Securities Act of 1933.  

For
new subscribers, the minimum initial investment is $25,000 ($10,000 for benefit plan investors (including IRAs). The minimum additional
subscription amount for current investors is $5,000.  

Series
J completed its initial offering on December 1, 2005 with gross proceeds of $31,024,443.  

D.    Exchanges,
                                         Redemptions and Termination  

Redemptions
from Series J are permitted on a monthly basis with no redemption charges applicable to either Class I or Class II Units.  

In
the event that the Net Asset Value of a Series, after adjustments for distributions, contributions and redemptions, declines by
50% or more since the commencement of trading activities or the first day of a fiscal year, the Series will automatically terminate.
Should the Managing Owner make a determination that Series J s aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses
make it unreasonable or imprudent to continue the business of Series J, or, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, if the
aggregate Net Asset Value of Series J as of the close of business on any business day declines below $10 million, the Managing
Owner may dissolve Series J.

              OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

A.    Basis
                                         of Accounting (Continued)  

In
the opinion of the Managing Owner, the condensed financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to state fairly the financial position of Series J as of September 30, 2016 and the results of its operations
for the Third Quarter 2016, Third Quarter 2015, Year-To-Date 2016 and Year-To-Date 2015. The operating results for these interim
periods may not be indicative of the results expected for a full year.  

Certain amounts in Third Quarter 2015 and Year-to-Date 2015 condensed financial statements were reclassified to conform with the Third Quarter 2016 and Year-to-Date 2016 presentation. The reclassification did not have any material impact on the condensed financial statements.  

The
condensed financial statements of Series J are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (  U.S. GAAP  ). Such principles require the Managing Owner to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
have been omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and notes thereto included in Series J s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The
weighted average number of Units outstanding was computed for purposes of disclosing net gain (loss) per weighted average Unitholder.
The weighted average number of Units is equal to the number of Units outstanding at period end, adjusted proportionately for Units
subscribed and redeemed based on their respective time outstanding during the period.  

Investment
in securities consists of publicly-traded mutual funds, which are valued using the quoted share price on the last day of the period.
Realized gains and losses from investment in securities is determined using the identified cost method. Any change in net unrealized
gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the condensed statements of operations. Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend
date.  

Series
J has elected not to provide a statement of cash flows since substantially all of Series J s investments are carried at fair
value and classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy table, Series J has little or no debt and
a condensed statement of changes in Unitholders  capital (Net Asset Value) is provided.  

Consistent
with standard business practice in the normal course of business, Series J has provided general indemnifications to the Managing
Owner, the Trading Advisors and others when they act, in good faith, in the best interests of Series J. Series J is unable to
develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future
claim, but expects the risk of having to make any payments under these general business indemnifications to be remote.

A.    Basis
                                         of Accounting (Continued)  

Series
J accounts for financial assets and liabilities using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three levels: quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level
1), inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (Level
2), and unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (Level 3).  

Series
J considers its investments in publicly-traded mutual funds to be based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
(Level 1).  

There
are no Level 3 investments as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, nor any portion of the interim periods.  

The
following tables summarize the assets measured at fair value using the fair value hierarchy:  

B.    Cash
                                         and Cash Equivalents  

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash and investments in overnight deposits. Interest income, if any, includes interest on cash and
overnight deposits. In the event of a financial institution s insolvency, recovery of cash on deposit may be limited to account
insurance or other protections afforded such deposits. Series J has established procedures to actively monitor market risk and
minimize credit risk, although there can be no assurance that it will, in fact, succeed in doing so. The Unitholders bear the
risk of loss only to the extent of the market value of their respective investments and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions
or redemptions received.  

C.    Income
                                         Taxes  

Series
J is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, Series J is not required to provide for, or pay,
any U.S. federal or state income taxes. Income tax attributes that arise from its operations are passed directly to the Unitholders
including the Managing Owner. Series J may be subject to other state and local taxes in jurisdictions in which it operates.

Series
J appropriately recognizes and discloses uncertain tax provisions in their financial statements. Recognition is permitted for
each position if, based on its technical merits, it is  more likely than not  that the position will be upheld under
audit by tax authorities. The Managing Owner has reviewed Series J s tax positions for all open years and concluded that
no provision for income taxes or expense is required in these condensed financial statements. Series J has elected an accounting
policy to classify interest and penalties related to income taxes as interest or other expense.  

There
have been no differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets, liabilities or Unitholders  capital since inception

Income
and expenses (excluding the service fee and upfront sales commissions further discussed in Note 5) are allocated pro rata to the
Class I Units and Class II Units monthly based on the Units outstanding during the month. Class I Units are charged with the service
fee and upfront sales commission applicable to such Units. Distributions (other than redemptions of Units) may be made at the
sole discretion of the Managing Owner on a pro rata basis in accordance with the respective capital balances of the Unitholders.
The Managing Owner has not and does not presently intend to make any distributions.  

E.    Offering
                                         Costs  

In
accordance with the Trust s Agreement and Prospectus, the Managing Owner is responsible for the payment of all offering expenses
of Series J incurred after the Initial Offering Period ( ongoing offering costs ), provided that the amount of such
ongoing offering costs paid by the Managing Owner are subject to reimbursement by the Trust, without interest, in up to 36 monthly
payments during each of the first 36 months following the month in which such expenses were paid by the Managing Owner. Through
September 2016, the Managing Owner has paid $2,936,640 in ongoing offering costs, of which $2,879,478 has been allocated to Series
J.  

Ongoing
offering costs incurred through November 30, 2006 in the amount of $599,063 will not be reimbursed to the Managing Owner. For
the period December 1, 2006 through September 30, 2016, the Managing Owner incurred and Series J was allocated ongoing offering
costs in the amount of $2,300,021 and $2,280,415, respectively.  

Series
J will only be liable for payment of ongoing offering costs on a monthly basis. If Series J terminates prior to completion of
payment of such amounts to the Managing Owner, the Managing Owner will not be entitled to any additional payments, and Series
J will have no further obligation to the Managing Owner.  

During
the Third Quarter 2016 and Third Quarter 2015, Series J s allocable portion of ongoing offering costs did not exceed 0.50%
per annum of the Net Asset Value of Series J.

The
investment in Affiliated Investment Funds is reported at fair value in Series J s condensed statements of financial condition.
Fair value ordinarily is the fund s net asset value as determined for the Affiliated Investment Funds in accordance with
the fund s valuation policies and reported at the time of Series J s valuation by the management of the funds. Generally,
the fair value of Series J s investment in the Affiliated Investment Funds represents the amount that Series J could reasonably
expect to receive from the Affiliated Investment Funds if Series J s investment was redeemed at the time of the valuation,
based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that Series J believes to be reliable.

820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent).  ASU
2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured
using net asset value per share as a practical expedient. The Managing Owner of the Trust adopted ASU 2015-07 as of January 1,
2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-07 did not have a material impact on the Trust s Financial Statements.

Note 4.     MANAGING
              OWNER AND AFFILIATES   

The
Managing Owner is paid a monthly management fee of 1/12 th  of 0.5% (0.5% per annum) of Series J s Net Asset Value
at the beginning of each month (See Note 3).  

Series
J invests a portion of the excess cash balances not required for margin through certain investment funds which invest in (i) U.S.
government securities (which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States), (ii)
any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. treasury bills and issues of agencies
of the United States government, (iii) corporate bonds or notes, or (iv) other instruments permitted by applicable rules and regulations
(collectively,   Certain Investment Funds  ). The objective is to obtain a rate of return for Series J that balances
risk and return relative to the historically low yields on short term cash deposits with banks and/or brokerage firms. There is
no guarantee that the Managing Owner will be successful in investing the excess cash successfully to obtain a greater yield than
available on short term cash deposits with banks and/or brokerage firms. The Managing Owner is paid monthly 1/12 th 
of 50% of the first 1% of the positive returns earned on Series J s investments in Certain Investment Funds. The calculation
is based on Series J s average annualized Net Asset Value, and any losses related to returns on Certain Investment Funds
must first be recovered through subsequent positive returns prior to the Managing Owner receiving a payment. After the calculation
of the amount payable to the Managing Owner, Series J will be credited with all additional positive returns (or 100% of any losses)
on Series J s investments in Certain Investment Funds. If at the end of any calendar year, a loss has been incurred on the
returns for Certain Investment Funds, then the loss carry forward will reset to zero for the next calendar year with regards to
the calculation of the Managing Owner s portion of Certain Investment Fund s income. As of September 30, 2016, the loss
carry forward amounted to $0. For the Third Quarter 2016, Third Quarter 2015, Year-To-Date 2016 and Year-To-Date 2015 the Managing
Owner s portion of interest earned on Certain Investment Funds amounted to $12,064, $0, $39,047 and $11,276, respectively.  

Series
J pays a monthly administrative services fee to Clarity for risk management and related services with respect to monitoring the
Trading Advisors, indirectly through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds based on their respective beginning of month
Allocated Assets. For the Third Quarter 2016, Third Quarter 2015, Year-To-Date 2016 and Year-To-Date 2015, the administrative
services fee earned indirectly totaled $7,225, $9,423, $23,223 and $30,643, respectively.  

Note 5.     SERVICE

Series
J pays a service fee with respect to Class I Units, monthly in arrears, equal to 1/12 th  of 2% (2% per annum) of the

equal to 2% of the initial Net Asset Value per Unit of each Class I Unit sold by the Correspondent Selling Agents (  CSA  ),
payable on the date such Class I Units are purchased. Commencing with the 13 th  month after the purchase of a Class
I Unit, the CSAs received an ongoing monthly commission equal to 1/12 th  of 2% (2% per annum) of the Net Asset Value
per Class I Unit as of the beginning of each month of the Class I Units sold by them.  

The
Service Fee   Class I Units (as described below) disclosed on the condensed statements of operations represents (i) the
monthly 1/12 th  of 2% of the Net Asset Value per Class I Unit as of the beginning of each month of the Class I Units,
(ii) the initial upfront sales commission of 2%, and (iii) a deduction for Series J s recapture of the 1/12 th

              IN AFFILIATED INVESTMENT FUNDS (CONTINUED)   

Prior
to May 1, 2015, Series J s investment in Affiliated Investment Funds was not fully funded, but was subject to additional
capital calls up to the full amount of the capital commitment. Effective May 1, 2015, in accordance with the amendment to CTA
Choice s Private Placement Memorandum, the full amount of Series J s capital contribution to an Affiliated Investment
Fund will be traded by each Trading Advisor pursuant to its trading strategy at the Affiliated Investment Fund s Investment
Level Factor. An Affiliated Investment Fund s Investment Level Factor multiplied by the capital contribution of Series J
to an Affiliated Investment Fund shall equal Series J s Investment Level. An Affiliated Investment Fund s Investment
Level Factor is the trading leverage factor of an Affiliated Investment Fund, as designated by Clarity from time to time for such
Affiliated Investment Fund, and reflects the level at which a Trading Advisor is instructed to trade the Affiliated Investment
Fund s assets. Clarity may increase or decrease the Affiliated Investment Fund s Investment Level Factor in its sole
discretion.

Series
J s investment in Affiliated Investment Funds is subject to the market and credit risks of securities held or sold short
by their respective Affiliated Investment Fund. Clarity has established procedures to monitor market risk and minimize credit
risk, although there can be no assurance that it will, in fact, succeed in doing so. The interestholders within CTA Choice bear
the risk of loss only to the extent of the market value of their respective investments and, in certain specific circumstances,
distributions and redemptions received.

No
derivative instruments were directly held by Series J as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Derivative trading activity
is conducted within the Affiliated Investment Funds. Series J s investment in Affiliated Investment Funds is subject to the
market and credit risks of the futures contracts, options on futures contracts, forward currency contracts and other financial
instruments held or sold short by them. Series J bears the risk of loss only to the extent of the capital commitment of its investment
and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions and redemptions received.  

Series
J is exposed to various types of risks associated with the derivative instruments and related markets in which it indirectly invests
through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds. These risks include, but are not limited to, risk of loss from fluctuations
in the value of derivative instruments held (market risk) and the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of Series
J s investment activities (credit risk), including investment in Affiliated Investment Funds.  

The
Managing Owner has established procedures to actively monitor market risk and minimize credit risk, although there can be no assurance
that it will, in fact, succeed in doing so. The Unitholders bear the risk of loss only to the extent of the fair value of their
respective investment in Series J and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions and redemptions received.  

Market
Risk   

Market
risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including government programs and policies, political and economic events, the
level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the diversification effect among the derivative instruments,
the liquidity and inherent volatility of the markets in which Series J indirectly invests through its ownership in Affiliated
Investment Funds.  

Credit
Risk   

The
Managing Owner attempts to minimize both credit and market risks by requiring Series J and its Trading Advisors to abide by various
trading limitations and policies. The Managing Owner monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies, which include,
but are not limited to, executing and clearing all trades with creditworthy counterparties; limiting the amount of margin or premium
required for any one commodity or all commodities combined; and generally limiting transactions to contracts which are traded
in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions.

Introduction   

General    

World
Monitor Trust III (the   Trust  ) was formed as a Delaware Statutory Trust on September 28, 2004, with separate
series (each, a   Series  ) of units of beneficial interest (  Units  ). Its term will expire on
December 31, 2054 (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances). The trustee of the Trust is Wilmington Trust Company.
The Trust s fiscal year for book and tax purposes ends on December 31.  

The
Trust s Units were initially offered in four (4) separate and distinct Series: Series G, Series H, Series I and Series J
(the   Registrant  ). The Trust may issue additional Series of Units in the future. Each Series will continue to
exist until terminated pursuant to the provisions of Article XIII of the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust
Agreement (the   Trust Agreement  ). Each Series offers Units in two classes (each, a   Class  )
  Class I and Class II. Class I Units pay a service fee. Class II Units may only be offered to investors who are represented
by approved correspondent selling agents who are directly compensated by the investor for services rendered in connection with
an investment in the Trust (such arrangements commonly referred to as   wrap-accounts  ) (see Note 5 of the condensed
financial statements).  

Series
G, H, I and J commenced trading operations on December 1, 2005.  

Units
are offered as of the beginning of each month, and Units will continue to be offered in each Series until the maximum amount of
each Series  Units which are registered are sold. The Managing Owner may suspend or terminate the offering of Units of any
Series at any time or extend the offering by registering additional Units. The Managing Owner terminated the offering of Units
of Series H and Series I effective March 31, 2007 and dissolved Series H and Series I effective close of business on April 30,
2007. The Managing Owner terminated the offering of Units of Series G on December 31, 2007 and dissolved Series G effective close
of business on December 31, 2007.  

Managing
Owner and its Affiliates    

Kenmar
Preferred Investments, LLC (  Kenmar Preferred   or the   Managing Owner  ), is the Managing Owner
of the Registrant.  

Kenmar
Preferred has been the Managing Owner of the Registrant since October 1, 2004. The Managing Owner may, but is not required under
the terms of the Trust Agreement to maintain an interest in the Registrant.  

The
Registrant reimburses the Managing Owner for services it performs for the Registrant, which include, but are not limited to: management,
legal, accounting, registrar, transfer and assignment functions, investor communications, printing, postage and related services
with respect to monitoring the Trust and other administrative services. The Registrant pays a monthly fee to Clarity Managed Account
  Analytics Platform, LLC (  Clarity  ), an affiliate of the Managing Owner, for risk management and related
services with respect to monitoring the Trading Advisors.

The
Offering    

Units
are being offered to investors who meet certain established suitability standards. Prior to November 30, 2008, investments required
a minimum aggregate initial subscription of $5,000 and $2,000 for certain Benefit Plan Investors (including IRAs), although the
minimum purchase for any single series was $500. Effective December 1, 2008, the minimum initial investment for new subscribers
is $25,000 ($10,000 for benefit plan investors (including IRAs)) and the minimum additional subscription amount for current investors,
who are   accredited investors ,  is $5,000.  

Effective
November 30, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Managing Owner of the Registrant determined that the Registrant s Units
are no longer to be publicly offered and are only to be available on a private placement basis to accredited investors pursuant
to Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933 (the   Securities Act  ). This change in the manner in which the
Registrant s Units are offered has no material impact to current investors as there is no change in the fees and expenses
and redemption terms of the Units or any change in the management and investment strategy and reporting provided to investors
of the Registrant. New subscriptions must be made by persons that are accredited investors. Current investors that are not accredited
investors are not required to redeem their current Units, but are not able to purchase additional Units.  

Initially,
the Units for each Series were offered for a period ending November 30, 2005 (  Initial Offering Period  ) at $100
per Unit. The subscription minimum of $30,000,000 for the Registrant was reached during the Initial Offering Period permitting
all of Series G, H, I and J to commence trading operations. The Registrant completed its initial offering on December 1,
2005 with gross proceeds of $31,024,443, which was fully allocated to the trading vehicles. Series H and Series I Units were fully
redeemed as of April 30, 2007 and Series G s Units as of December 31, 2007. Up to $281,250,000 Series J, Class I and $93,750,000
Series J, Class II Units are being offered (totaling $375,000,000) (  Subscription Maximum  ).  

The
Trading Advisors and the Trading Vehicles    

The
Registrant allocates a portion of its net assets (  Allocated Assets  ) to commodity trading advisors (each, a
  Trading Advisor   and collectively, the   Trading Advisors  ). Each Trading Advisor manages a
portion of the Allocated Assets of the Registrant and makes the trading decisions with respect to those Allocated Assets. The
Managing Owner may terminate any current Trading Advisor or select new trading advisors from time to time in its sole discretion.
In the future, the Managing Owner may determine to access certain Trading Advisors through separate investee pools.  

In
general, the Registrant expects to access the Trading Advisors through various series of CTA Choice Fund LLC (  CTA Choice  ).
CTA Choice is an  umbrella fund  having multiple segregated series, each of which is referred to herein as a   CTA
Fund   or an   Affiliated Investment Fund  . Each CTA Fund has its own clearly-defined investment objective
and strategies that are implemented by a Trading Advisor. Clarity, an affiliate of the Managing Owner, is the managing member
of CTA Choice. From January 1, 2015 to April 30, 2015, the Registrant allocated approximately one quarter of its Allocated Assets
to each of the following CTA Funds:

SCT and WTN.  

Eagle s
Global Program is a technical, trend-following system developed, based on Eagle s extensive experience in observing and trading
the global markets, to capture a well-structured trading philosophy. The trading philosophy incorporates trend following elements,
money management principles, predetermined risk parameters and volatility adjustment features. The system is designed to trade
in a wide range of global futures markets currencies, fixed income, energies, commodities and stock indices that exhibit
orderly intermediate and long-term trends, and adjust to changes in market environment with no predetermined allocation to any
one sector. Eagle analyzes typical behavior and volatility patterns of various markets. The system seeks markets with potentially
good risk/reward profiles while attempting to avoid markets characterized by excessive volatility and sharp price corrections.
An attempt is made to participate in markets which exhibit favorable  signal to noise  characteristics. Money management
and risk control disciplines serve to attempt to limit downside risk.  

Ellington s
Global Macro Trading Program primarily invests by taking both long and short positions in global currency, fixed income, commodity
and equity markets through a wide range of derivative instruments and direct investments. Ellington will, from time to time, make
extensive use of derivative instruments, including, without limitation, futures and forwards contracts and options on global currencies,
commodities, fixed income and equity securities and security indices; interest rate derivatives (such as swaps, caps and floors);
credit default swaps; options on any of the foregoing; and other over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivatives.  

Fort s
Global Diversified Trading Program consists of three separate strategy components: (i) trend anticipating; (ii) trend following;
and (iii) short term mean reversion. Fort s investment objective is to achieve attractive absolute returns and reduced volatility
of returns primarily through trading a broad spectrum of futures contracts, including short-term interest rates, bonds, currencies,
stock indices, energy and metals. Fort has designed its Trading Program in an attempt to produce high quality risk adjusted returns
with a low correlation to broad based equity markets such as the S P 500 or the MSCI world index. In an attempt to reduce
volatility, the trading program is not constructed based primarily on one-sided exposure to a particular market factor, such as
long exposure to equity investments.  

KeyQuant s
Key Trends program is a medium to long-term trend following trading program. Analysis allows capturing major economic cycles.
The Trading Program aims to profit more from market trends thanks to its continuous analysis of trends. Moreover, the Trading
Program offers a unique portfolio allocation mechanism known as the GEF. In the case of an uncertain economic scenario, the GEF
systematically adjusts the volatility target downwards to account for uncertainty in trends.  

Quantmetrics 
QM Multi Strategy Program follows the QM Directional Strategy and the QM Premier Strategy. The QM Directional Strategy is a quantitative
short term directional futures strategy. The strategy trades futures and foreign exchange with a holding period ranging from 5
minutes to a few days. The aim is to provide investors with long-term capital appreciation by realizing many short-term gains
across a number of different asset classes. The investment approach identifies and captures market inefficiencies using statistical
and econometric models. As the models selectively choose the timing of the trades, it is ideally positioned to benefit from liquidity
driven price shocks. The QM Premier Strategy is a quantitative market neutral futures strategy. The strategy trades futures with
a holding period from 20 minutes to 1 day. The aim is to provide investors with long-term capital appreciation by seeking to profit
from short term liquidity imbalances in pairs of equity index futures. The investment approach identifies and captures market
inefficiencies using statistical and econometric models. Disciplined risk management is built into each trading algorithm, with
time stops strictly adhered to.  

Red
Oak s Fundamental Trading Program is driven by fundamentals: specifically, its strategy is grounded in Red Oak s principals 
experience in and knowledge of the different commodity and commodity-related markets and the various fundamental factors which
affect each of such markets. Thus, unlike many trading strategies now being employed by managed futures professionals, Red Oak s
approach is neither technically-based nor trend-following. Fundamental analysis, in general, is based on a study of factors external
to the markets in predicting future prices. Such factors might include, among other things, supply and demand factors for a particular
commodity, the economy of a particular country, government policies, domestic and foreign political and economic events and changing
trade prospects. Fundamental analysis is premised on the concept that market prices frequently may not reflect (on a real time
basis) the actual value of a commodity, although such value will eventually determine price levels.

SCT
Capital s AQT1X Trading Program trades commodity futures contracts in U.S. and non-U.S. markets on a highly leveraged basis.
SCT Capital analyzes historic price action in markets using machine learning, statistical and quantitative methods as a means
of predicting market opportunity and discovering repeatable patterns in historical prices. The program recognizes that each asset
class has its own  signature  in the global marketplace, emphasizing asset class-specific design and non-correlation
objectives within each of the sub-models in the trading program. SCT Capital has created models for specific asset classes, using
the above techniques to generate positions in fixed-income, currency, commodity and equity futures. SCT Capital employs a portfolio
management process to manage the aggregate risk across all positions generated by the models.  

Winton s
Diversified Program employs a computer-based system to engage in the speculative trading of international futures, options and
forwards markets, government securities such as bonds, as well as certain over the counter (  OTC ") instruments,
which may include foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts and swaps. Winton seeks to combine highly liquid financial
instruments offering positive but low Sharpe ratios (meaning that profits have been achieved with a certain level of risk) and
generally low correlation over the long term to other markets such as equities and fixed income.  

Fees
and Expenses    

Management
Fee    

The
Registrant pays the Managing Owner in advance a monthly management fee equal to 1/12 th  of 0.5% (0.5% per annum) of
the Registrant s Net Asset Value (defined below) at the beginning of each month. See Note 4 of the Registrant s financial
statements included in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the   Registrant s 2015 Annual Report  ),
which is filed as an exhibit to the Registrant s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  

Net
Asset Value   is the total assets of the Registrant less total liabilities of the Registrant, each determined on the basis
of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
Registrant, indirectly through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds, pays a monthly administrative services fee in the
amount of 1/12 th  of 0.25% (0.25% per annum) of the respective CTA Fund s beginning of month Allocated Assets to
Clarity for risk management and related services with respect to monitoring the Trading Advisors.  

Trading
Advisors  Fees     

The
Registrant, indirectly through its investment in the Affiliated Investment Funds, pays each Trading Advisor a monthly management
fee and an incentive fee accrued monthly and paid quarterly.  

****    The
                                         Registrant invests in SCT s 2x program and pays a management fee of 1.50%.  

New
High Net Trading Profits   (for purposes of calculating a Trading Advisor s incentive fees) will be computed as of
the close of business of the last day of each calendar quarter (the   Incentive Measurement Date  ) and will include
such profits (as outlined below) since the immediately preceding Incentive Measurement Date (or, with respect to the first Incentive
Measurement Date, since commencement of operations of the Registrant or the date the Trading Advisor commenced trading activities
for the Registrant), each an Incentive Measurement Period. New High Net Trading Profits for any Incentive Measurement Period will
be the net profits, if any, from the Trading Advisor s trading during such period (including (i) realized trading profit
(loss) plus or minus (ii) the change in unrealized trading profit (loss) on open positions), and will be calculated after the
determination of certain transaction costs attributable to the Trading Advisor s trading activities, operating expenses,
and the Trading Advisor s management fee, but before deduction of any incentive fees payable during the Incentive Measurement
Period. New High Net Trading Profits will not include interest earned or credited on the assets allocated to the Trading Advisor.  

27  

           Table of Contents            

New
High Net Trading Profits will be generated only to the extent that the cumulative New High Net Trading Profits achieved by the
Trading Advisor exceed the highest level of cumulative New High Net Trading Profits achieved by such Trading Advisor as of a previous
Incentive Measurement Date. Except as set forth below, net losses from prior months must be recouped before New High Net Trading
Profits can again be generated.  

If
a withdrawal or distribution occurs or if a Trading Advisor s advisory agreement with the relevant CTA Fund is terminated
at any date that is not an Incentive Measurement Date, the date of the withdrawal or distribution or termination will be treated
as if it were an Incentive Measurement Date. New High Net Trading Profits for an Incentive Measurement Period shall exclude capital
contributions allocated to the Trading Advisor in an Incentive Measurement Period, distributions or redemptions paid or payable
from the Trading Advisor s account during an Incentive Measurement Period and any loss carry-forward attributable to the
Trading Advisor will be reduced in the same proportion that the value of the assets allocated away from the Trading Advisor comprises
of the value of the assets allocated to the Trading Advisor prior to such allocation away from the Trading Advisor. In calculating
New High Net Trading Profits, incentive fees paid for a previous Incentive Measurement Period will not reduce cumulative New High
Net Trading Profits in subsequent periods.  

Brokerage
Commissions and Fees    

The
Registrant indirectly pays to the clearing brokers all brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, National Futures
Association (  NFA  ) fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged
in connection with the Registrant s trading activities. These activities are charged indirectly through the Registrant s
Affiliated Investment Funds and are reflected within the respective net asset values of each of the Affiliated Investment Funds.
On average, total charges paid to the clearing brokers are expected to be less than $10.00 per round-turn trade, although the
clearing broker s brokerage commissions and trading fees will be determined on a contract-by-contract basis. The exact amount
of such brokerage commissions and trading fees to be incurred is impossible to estimate and will vary based upon a number of factors
including the trading frequency of each Trading Advisor, the types of instruments traded, transaction sizes, degree of leverage
employed and transaction rates in effect from time to time.  

Routine
Operational, Administrative and Other Ordinary Expenses    

The
Registrant pays directly or indirectly all of its routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses, including,
but not limited to, (i) legal, bookkeeping, accounting, custodial, administration (including, without limitation, the costs and
expenses of the Administrator), auditing, tax preparation charges and related charges of the Registrant (including reimbursement
of the Managing Owner on a reasonable time-spent basis, for certain legal, accounting, administrative and registrar and transfer
agent work performed by certain of the Managing Owner s personnel for and on behalf of the Registrant), as well as printing
and other related expenses, (ii) investment related expenses, including, but not limited to brokerage commissions,  bid-ask 
spreads, mark-ups, margin interest and other transactional charges and clearing fees, as well as banking, sales and purchase commissions
and charges and exchange fees, fees and charges of other custodians and clearing agencies, interest and commitment fees on loans
and debit balances, income taxes, withholding taxes, transfer taxes and other governmental charges and duties, and other transactional
charges and clearing fees incurred by the Trading Advisor on behalf of the Registrant, the Registrant s pro rata share of
the expenses of any Affiliated Investment Fund into which it invests, and any due diligence expenses incurred in selecting and
monitoring the Trading Advisor and any Affiliated Investment Fund, (iii) operational and overhead expenses of the Registrant,
including but not limited to, photocopying, postage, and telephone expenses, (iv) preparation of monthly, quarterly, annual and
other reports required by applicable Federal and state regulatory authorities, (v) the Registrant s meetings and preparing,
printing and mailing of proxy statements and reports to Unitholders, (vi) client relations and services, and (vii) computer equipment,
system maintenance and other technology-related expenses.  

Extraordinary
Fees and Expenses    

The
Registrant pays all its extraordinary fees and expenses, if any, and its allocable portion of all extraordinary fees and expenses
of the Registrant generally, if any, as determined by the Managing Owner. Extraordinary fees and expenses are fees and expenses
that are non-recurring and unusual in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs and any permitted indemnification
payments related thereto. Extraordinary fees and expenses shall also include material expenses that are not currently anticipated
obligations of the Registrant or of managed futures funds in general, such as the payment of partnership taxes or governmental
fees associated with payment of such taxes. Routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses will not be deemed
extraordinary expenses. Any fees and expenses imposed on the Registrant due to the status of an individual shall be paid by such
individual or the Registrant, not the Managing Owner.

           Table of Contents            

Competition    

The
Managing Owner and its affiliates have formed, and may continue to form, various entities to engage in the speculative trading
of futures, forward and options contracts which have certain of the same investment policies as the Registrant.  

The
Registrant is an open-end fund, which solicits the sale of additional Units on a monthly basis until the maximum amount of Units
being offered by the Registrant have been sold. As such, the Registrant may compete with other entities, whether or not formed
by the Managing Owner, to attract new Unitholders. In addition, to the extent that a Trading Advisor recommends similar or identical
trades to the Registrant and other accounts that it manages, the Registrant may compete with those accounts for the execution
of the same or similar trades, as well as with other market participants.  

Employees    

The
Registrant has no employees. Management and administrative services for the Registrant are performed by the Managing Owner or
third parties pursuant to the Trust Agreement, as further discussed in Notes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 of the Registrant s 2015 Annual
Report, which is filed as an exhibit to the Registrant s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  

Financial
Information about Segments   

The
Registrant s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes. The Registrant does not engage in the
production or sale of any goods or services. The objective of the Registrant s business is appreciation of its assets through
speculative trading in commodity interests. Financial information about the Registrant s business, as of September 30, 2016,
is set forth under Items 2 and 3 herein.  

Financial
Information about Geographic Areas   

Although
the Registrant has indirect exposure to the global futures, forward and option markets, it does not have operations outside of
the United States.  

Available
Information   

The
Registrant files an annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments
to these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the   SEC  ). You may read and copy any document
filed by the Registrant at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the
SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for information on the Public Reference Room. The Registrant does not maintain an internet website; however,
the Registrant s SEC filings are available to the public from the EDGAR database on the SEC s website at  http://www.sec.gov .
The Registrant s CIK number is 0001345991.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

General    

Preparation
of the condensed financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (  U.S. GAAP  ) requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance.
Applying these policies requires the Managing Owner to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation
of the Registrant s condensed financial statements. Actual results may differ from the estimates used.  

The
Managing Owner has evaluated the Registrant s condensed financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that
the policies discussed below are critical accounting policies because they involve estimates, judgments and assumptions that are
particularly complex, subjective or uncertain. For further discussion of the Registrant s significant accounting policies,
see Note 2 of the Registrant s 2015 Annual Report, which is filed as an exhibit to the Registrant s Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

           Table of Contents            

The
Registrant records all investments at fair value in its condensed financial statements, with changes in fair value reported in
the condensed statements of operations. Generally, fair values are based on quoted market prices; however, in certain circumstances,
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining fair value in the absence of an active market closing price. The
Registrant considers its investments in publicly-traded mutual funds to be based on quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets (Level 1). Level 3 inputs reflect the Registrant s assumptions that it believes market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability. The Registrant develops Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances, which
may include indirect correlation to a market value, combinations of market values or the Registrant s proprietary data. Level
3 inputs generally include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation of observable market data. The Registrant
does not currently have any investments valued using Level 3 inputs.  

Of
the Registrant s investments as of September 30, 2016, $1,923,997 or 21.00% of the Net Asset Value were classified as Level
1 and the remainder was invested in Affiliated Investment Funds. Generally, the fair value of the Registrant s investment
in the Affiliated Investment Funds represents the amount that the Registrant could reasonably expect to receive from the Affiliated
Investment Funds if the Registrant s investment was redeemed at the time of the valuation, based on information reasonably
available at the time the valuation is made and that the Registrant believes to be reliable.  

The
Registrant invests a portion of the excess cash balances not required for margin through certain investment funds which invest
in (i) U.S. government securities (which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States),
(ii) any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. treasury bills and issues of agencies
of the United States government, (iii) corporate bonds or notes, or (iv) other instruments permitted by applicable rules and regulations
(collectively,   Certain Investment Funds  ). The objective is to obtain a rate of return for the Registrant that
balances risk and return relative to the historically low yields on short-term cash deposits with banks and/or brokerage firms.
There is no guarantee that the Managing Owner will be successful in investing the excess cash successfully to obtain a greater
yield than available on short-term cash deposits with banks and/or brokerage firms. The Managing Owner is paid monthly 1/12 th
 of 50% of the first 1% of the positive returns earned on the Registrant s investments in Certain Investment Funds.
The calculation is based on the Registrant s average annualized Net Asset Value, and any losses related to returns on the
Certain Investment Funds must first be recovered through subsequent positive returns prior to the Managing Owner receiving a payment.
After the calculation of the amount payable to the Managing Owner, the Registrant will be credited with all additional positive
returns (or 100% of any losses) on the Registrant s investment in Certain Investment Funds. If, at the end of any calendar
year, a loss has been incurred on the returns for the Certain Investment Funds, then the loss carry forward will reset to zero
for the next calendar year with regards to the calculation of the Managing Owner s portion of the Certain Investment Fund s
income.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
Registrant commenced operations on December 1, 2005 with gross proceeds of $31,024,443 allocated to commodities trading.
Additional contributions raised through the continuous offering of limited units (  Limited Units  ) and general
units (  General Units   or   Managing Owner Units   and, together with the Limited Units,   Units  )
of beneficial ownership in the Registrant for the period from December 1, 2005 (commencement of operations) to September
30, 2016 resulted in additional gross proceeds to the Registrant of $195,857,057.

Liquidity    

A
portion of the Registrant s net assets is held in cash, which is used as margin for its indirect trading in commodities through
its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds.  

Commodity
contracts exposed to indirectly through the Registrant s investment in Affiliated Investment Funds may be subject to periods
of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, commodity exchanges limit
fluctuations in certain commodity futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as  daily limits .
During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract for a particular
commodity has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the commodity can neither be taken nor
liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Commodity futures prices have occasionally moved
the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Such market conditions could prevent the Registrant from
promptly liquidating its indirect exposure, through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds, to commodity futures positions.  

Since
the Registrant s business is to trade futures, forward and option contracts through its investment in Affiliated Investment
Funds, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) or the inability of counterparties
to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk). The Registrant s exposure to market risk is influenced by a number
of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the liquidity of the markets in which
the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of the Registrant s speculative
trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could result in losses considerably beyond the Registrant s
experience to date and could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of Unitholders  capital. The Managing
Owner attempts to minimize these risks by requiring the Registrant and the Trading Advisors to abide by various trading limitations
and policies, which include limiting margin amounts, trading only in liquid markets and permitting the use of stop loss provisions.
See Note 10 of the Registrant s 2015 Annual Report for a further discussion on the credit and market risks associated with
the Registrant s futures, forwards and option contracts held indirectly through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds.  

There
are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to
result in the Registrant s liquidity increasing or decreasing in a material way.  

The
Registrant does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets.  

Market
Overview   

Following
is a market overview for the Third Quarter 2016 and the Third Quarter 2015:  

Third
Quarter 2016     

Third
quarter market drivers included traders  expectations for global central bank activity (particularly divergence as the U.S.
Federal Reserve moves closer towards its next rate hike), the health of the global economy and the continued fallout from the
Brexit vote.  

In
the U.S., equity indices hit new highs as market participants believed that the economy would be strong enough to withstand an
anticipated year-end quarter-point rate hike from the Federal Reserve. While that optimism was tempered by quarter-end, U.S. indices
nevertheless ended September higher. U.S. bond prices took their lead from equity markets and fell (as yields rose) while staying
within well-defined ranges. Conversely, in overseas markets where the expectation was for continued accommodative policy, European
markets such as the German DAX and UK FTSE rose as did bond prices. Similarly, Asian equity markets including the Topix, Nikkei
and Hang Seng also moved higher albeit in Japan, bond prices plunged (and yields soared) when BOJ Governor Kuroda underwhelmed
the market with less aggressive stimulus than what was anticipated; by quarter end prices had moved a bit off the intra-quarter
low.

           Table of Contents            

In
currency markets, the dollar ended the three-month period slightly lower against a basket of currencies as it vacillated basis
expectations for Fed action; the Fed kept rates unchanged in September thereby increasing the odds for a December hike. The British
pound s freefall on the  leave  vote in June stabilized during the third quarter as the Bank of England unveiled
a strong package of stimulus including the first interest rate cut since 2009. In other markets, the euro ended the quarter slightly
higher while the Japanese yen, slightly lower.  

In
commodity markets, crude oil prices seesawed during the third quarter ultimately ending the period lower. Early on, prices sank
under the weight of elevated inventories, rising rig counts, demand concerns and a strong US dollar. Thereafter, prices moved
off those lows on signs of falling U.S. inventories and reports that OPEC had agreed to reduce production for the first time in
eight years. In precious metals, gold started the quarter on a positive note, rising to a two-year high only to drift lower as
the quarter progressed on expectations for higher U.S. interest rates. Conversely, palladium prices ended the quarter sharply
higher on stronger Chinese car sales amid potential shortfalls in supply.  

In
base metals, markets generally ended the period higher with the outlook for Chinese demand, supply, and the overall health of
the global economy influencing price. In traditional agricultural markets, grain prices ended the quarter lower on record yields;
soybean oil was the exception as diminished palm oil supply stoked strong demand for this substitute vegetable oil. Cocoa prices
similarly ended the quarter lower with market back in surplus while coffee and sugar moved higher on Brazilian weather concerns.
In meats, prices of both hogs and cattle moved south on weaker demand and ample animal supply.  

Third
Quarter 2015     

Volatility
took center stage in the third quarter as investors worried about a China slowdown and its ripple effects through the global economy.
In August, a surprise devaluation of the yuan created havoc sending shockwaves across global financial markets. In currencies,
some of the broadest moves were seen in the commodity exporters as slowing China growth translated into diminished physical demand;
the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars in addition to the Brazilian real and Norwegian krone were examples of currencies
that marked multi-year lows. Conversely, the Japanese yen and euro benefited from the uncertainty while unconventionally, the
U.S. dollar, a traditional safe haven, was shunned in August as U.S. rate-hike expectations were deferred.  

This
global uncertainty though brought investors back to global bond markets. Early in the quarter, safe-haven demand sparked by overseas
crises from the Chinese equity meltdown to a break-down in Greek debt negotiations, buoyed prices. Later, prices received an additional
lift as tumbling commodity prices diminished global inflationary expectations and weakening economic growth raised the specter
of further monetary accommodation, notably in Europe and Japan. Finally, the surprise resignation of John Boehner as Speaker of
the House also added uncertainty in the U.S. market. Conversely, global equities moved swiftly lower during Third Quarter 2015
as August s surprise devaluation of the Chinese yuan spooked the indices. The downdraft extended into September on news of
Volkswagen s emission-rigging scandal, the potential demise of Glencore and resurgent worries over global growth.  

The
downward trend in commodity markets continued into Third Quarter 2015. Crude oil started the quarter on a weak note as a global
supply glut combined with diminished demand sent prices to 6  year lows. At month end August though, prices soared 25%
in the final three trading session sparked by OPEC comments indicating a potential willingness to talk about production and a
report showing that US shale producers had begun cutting supplies; prices made little headway thereafter. Conversely, natural
gas prices continued to fall as warmer weather reduced demand. Base metals prices also ended the three month period lower on demand
worries while gold prices vacillated more broadly on changing global inflation expectations. Wheat, corn and soybeans all fell
in the third quarter as harvest progressed smoothly amid expectations for decreasing demand. Coffee, sugar and cocoa prices also
ended the quarter lower.  

Sector
Performance   

Due
to the nature of the Registrant s indirect trading activities, a period-to-period comparison of its trading results is not
meaningful. However, set forth below are the following:  

(a)       the
major sectors to which the Registrant s assets were allocated indirectly as of the Third Quarter 2016 and the Third Quarter
2015, measured as a percentage of the   gross speculator margin   (i.e., the minimum amount of cash or marginable
securities a speculator must post when buying or selling futures assets); and  

(b)       a
discussion of the Registrant s trading results for the major sectors in which the Registrant traded indirectly for the Third
Quarter 2016 and the Third Quarter 2015.

Third
Quarter 2016    

As
of September 30, 2016, the allocation of the Registrant s assets, through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds,
to major sectors was as follows:  

Trading
results for the major sectors in which the Registrant traded indirectly for the Third Quarter 2016 were as follows:  

Currencies:
 (-) The Registrant experienced losses in all three months of the quarter. Positions in the euro and Japanese yen were the
least successful. Positions in the Australian and New Zealand dollar were profitable.  

Interest
Rates: (-)  The Registrant experienced losses in global interest rates due largely to August losses in the Japanese government
bond as prices fell sharply on the Bank of Japan s post-meeting announcement. In addition, losses accumulated in July in
the Eurodollar as prices fell sharply in anticipation of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate increase.  

Indices:
(+)  The Registrant experienced relatively equal-sized gains in all three months of the quarter. Overall, single largest gains
were seen in the U.S. Russell 2000; trading in Japanese indices was also profitable. The largest index loss was in the German
DAX.  

Energies:
(-)  The Registrant experienced losses in the energy complex. Accumulated losses in WTI and Brent crude oil in July were largest
as prices fell on abundant global supply; trading in other markets in the complex was also unprofitable.  

Metals:
(+)  The Registrant realized gains in metals. Largest gains were in palladium as prices rallied on expectations of better auto
sales; gains were also posted in nickel and zinc. Largest losses were in gold as it vacillated on expectations for central bank
activity.  

Grains:
(-)  The Registrant realized losses in grains as prices of oats, rough rice, soybeans and wheat fell during the quarter on
abundant supply. Gains were realized in soybean oil as prices rallied on increased demand.  

Tropicals:
(+)  The Registrant realized small profits in tropical markets. The largest gains were in coffee as prices rose on supply concerns.
Losses were seen in cocoa, notably in August and sugar.  

Meats:
(+)  The Registrant realized profits in cattle as prices fell throughout the quarter.  

Third
Quarter 2015    

As
of September 30, 2015, the allocation of the Registrant s assets, through its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds,
to major sectors was as follows:  

33  

           Table of Contents            

Trading
results for the major sectors in which the Registrant traded indirectly for the Third Quarter 2015 were as follows:  

Currencies:
 (-) The Registrant experienced the majority of its losses in August as the Japanese yen and euro rallied sharply on safe haven
buying in the wake of the surprise Chinese devaluation of the yuan. These losses erased July gains on long dollar exposures.  

Energies:
 (+) The Registrant experienced gains in crude oil as prices ended the quarter lower on a global supply glut amid diminished
demand.  

Grains:
 (+) The Registrant realized profits in grains as the growing season in the U.S. progressed with few weather worries thereby
increasing expectations for sufficient supply to meet current demand.  

Indices:
 (-) The Registrant experienced losses as global equity indices slid while worries over the health of the global economy intensified.
The large losses in August erased gains in July and September.  

Interest
Rates:  : (+) The Registrant experience gains, notably in U.S. and European rates, as prices rallied on safe haven buying in
the wake of global uncertainty sparked by a slowing Chinese economy. Further, falling commodity prices dimmed the global inflationary
outlook thereby deferring expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike while increasing increased speculation for
additional European monetary accommodation.  

Meats:
 (+) The Registrant realized gains in each of the three months of the quarter due to positions in live cattle.  

Metals:
 : (+) The Registrant realized profits as the largest gains were realized in July as prices fell on worries that a slowing
global economy would reduce demand for industrial metals like copper and aluminum.  

Tropicals:
 (+) The Registrant realized small profits in the third quarter largely due to gains in coffee.

of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to Unitholders.  

The
Registrant s contractual obligations are with the Managing Owner, the Trading Advisors it accesses through its investment
in Affiliated Investment Funds and its commodity broker. Trading Advisor management fees payable by the Registrant to the Trading
Advisors through CTA Choice, and management fees payable to the Managing Owner are calculated as a fixed percentage of the Registrant s
Net Asset Value or Allocated Assets. Incentive fees payable by the Registrant to the Trading Advisors through CTA Choice are at
a fixed rate, calculated as a percentage of the Registrant s New High Net Trading Profits (as defined in the Trading Advisory
Agreements). As such, the Managing Owner cannot anticipate the amounts to be paid for future periods as Net Asset Values and New
High Net Trading Profits are not known until a future date. Commissions payable to the Registrant s commodity broker are
based on a cost per executed trade and, as such, the Managing Owner cannot anticipate the amount that will be required under the
brokerage agreement, as the level of executed trades are not known until a future date. These agreements are effective for one-year
terms, renewable automatically for additional one-year terms unless terminated. Additionally, these agreements may be terminated
by either party thereto for various reasons. Additionally, since the Registrant does not enter into other long-term debt obligations,
capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or other long-term liabilities that would otherwise be reflected on the
Registrant s condensed statements of financial condition, a table of contractual obligations has not been presented. For

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Introduction   

Past
Results Not Necessarily Indicative of Future Performance    

The
Registrant is a speculative commodity pool. The market sensitive instruments held by it are acquired for speculative trading purposes,
and substantially all of the Registrant s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the
risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Registrant s main line of business.  

Market
movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of the Registrant s open positions and, consequently, in its
earnings and cash flow. The Registrant s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and
volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the
diversification effects among the Registrant s open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades.  

The
Registrant rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it
is not possible to predict how a particular futures market scenario will affect performance, and the Registrant s past performance
is not necessarily indicative of its future results.  

Value
at Risk   is a measure of the maximum amount which the Registrant could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market
sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Registrant s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded
by the Registrant of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond
the indicated Value at Risk or the Registrant s experience to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of the foregoing,
as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the quantification included in this section should
not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Registrant s losses in any market sector will be
limited to Value at Risk or by the Registrant s attempts to manage its market risk.  

Standard
of Materiality    

Materiality
as used in this section,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  is based on an assessment of
reasonably possible market movements and the potential losses caused by such movements, taking into account the leverage, optionality
and multiplier features of the Registrant s market sensitive instruments.  

Quantifying
the Registrant s Trading Value at Risk   

Quantitative
Forward-Looking Statements    

The
following quantitative disclosures regarding the Registrant s market risk exposures contain  forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the   Securities Act  ) and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the   Exchange Act  )).  

The
Registrant s risk exposure in the various market sectors traded by the Trading Advisors is quantified below in terms of
Value at Risk. Due to the Registrant s mark-to-market accounting, any loss in the fair value of the Registrant s open
positions is directly reflected in the Registrant s earnings (realized or unrealized) and cash flow (at least in the case
of exchange-traded contracts in which profits and losses on open positions are settled daily through variation margin).  

Exchange
maintenance margin requirements have been used by the Registrant as the measure of its Value at Risk. Maintenance margin requirements
are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract
in 95%-99% of any one-day interval. The maintenance margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price
studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures
contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation.
Maintenance margin has been used rather than the more generally available initial margin, because initial margin includes a credit
risk component, which is not relevant to Value at Risk.  

In
the case of market sensitive instruments that are not exchange-traded (almost exclusively currencies in the case of the Registrant),
the margin requirements for the approximate estimated equivalent futures positions have been used as Value at Risk. In those rare
cases in which a futures-equivalent margin is not available, estimated dealers  margins have been used.  

In
quantifying the Registrant s Value at Risk, 100% positive correlation in the different positions held in each market risk
category has been assumed. Consequently, the margin requirements applicable to the open contracts have simply been aggregated
to determine each trading category s aggregate Value at Risk. The diversification effects resulting from the fact that the
Registrant s positions are rarely, if ever, 100% positively correlated have not been reflected.

The
Registrant s Trading Value at Risk in Different Market Sectors    

The
following table presents the trading value at risk associated with the Registrant s open positions by market sector through
its investment in Affiliated Investment Funds at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. All open position trading risk
exposures of the Registrant have been included in calculating the figure set forth below. At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Registrant had total capitalizations of approximately $9 million and $11 million, respectively.  

The
following table presents the average trading value at risk of the Registrant s open positions by market sector for the Third
Quarter 2016 and the Third Quarter 2015 based upon the Registrant s total average capitalization of approximately $9 million
and $12 million, respectively.  

Material
Limitations on Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk    

The
notional value of the market sector instruments held by the Registrant (directly/indirectly) is typically many times the applicable
maintenance margin requirement (maintenance margin requirements generally range between approximately 1% and 10% of the face value)
as well as many times the total capitalization of the Registrant. The magnitude of the Registrant s open positions creates
a  risk of ruin  not typically found in most other investment vehicles. Because of the size of its positions, certain
market conditions, although unusual, but historically recurring from time to time, could cause the Registrant to incur severe
losses over a short period of time. The foregoing Value at Risk table, as well as the past performance of the Registrant gives
no indication of this  risk of ruin.   

Non-Trading
Risk    

The
Registrant has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances (as well as
any market risk they represent) are immaterial.

Single
investor Beneficial Ownership Risk    

As
of September 30, 2016, the below investor beneficially owned more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Limited Units of Series
J, Class I issued by the Registrant.  

If
the investor decides to fully redeem its units, the Managing Owner may decide to close the operations and fully dissolve Registrant.  

Qualitative
Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures    

The
following qualitative disclosures regarding the Registrant s market risk exposures except for (i) those disclosures
that are statements of historical fact and (ii) the descriptions of how the Registrant manages its primary market risk exposures constitute
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.  

The
Registrant s primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by the Managing Owner and the Trading
Advisors for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks are one of which could cause
the actual results of the Registrant s risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government
interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals,
changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could
result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the Registrant.
There can be no assurance that the Registrant s current market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not change
materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the short- or long-term. Unitholders must be prepared to lose
all or substantially all of their investment in the Registrant.  

Based
on the trading value at risk at September 30, 2016, the Registrant experienced a net decrease in its value at risk, relative to
capitalization levels, as compared with the trading value at risk at December 31, 2015. A net decrease in the average trading
value at risk, relative to average capitalization levels was experienced during the Year-To-Date 2016 as compared with the Year-To-Date
2015.  

Qualitative
Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure    

The
means by which the Managing Owner and the Trading Advisors through CTA Choice attempt to manage the risk of the Registrant s
open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded.  

The
Trading Advisors attempt to minimize market risk exposure by applying their own risk management trading policies that include
the diversification of trading assets into various market sectors. Additionally, the Managing Owner s oversight committee
is responsible for evaluating and overseeing the Trading Advisors  trading policies. The oversight committee meets periodically
to discuss and analyze issues such as liquidity, position size, capacity, performance cycles, and new product and market strategies.  

The
Managing Owner attempts to minimize market risk exposure by requiring the Trading Advisors to abide by various trading limitations
and policies. The Managing Owner monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies which include, but are not limited
to, limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined and generally limiting
transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions. Additionally,
the Managing Owner shall automatically terminate the Trading Advisors through termination of the CTA Fund if the Net Asset Value
of the Registrant declines by 40% during any year or since the commencement of trading activities. Furthermore, the Trust Agreement
provides that the Registrant will liquidate its positions, and eventually dissolve, if the Registrant experiences a decline in
the Net Asset Value of 50% in any year or since the commencement of trading activities. In each case, the decline in Net Asset
Value is after giving effect for contributions, distributions and redemptions. The Managing Owner may impose additional restrictions
(through modifications of such trading limitations and policies) upon the trading activities of the Trading Advisors as it, in
good faith, deems to be in the best interest of the Registrant.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

The
Registrant s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Registrant in reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Registrant s management, including
the Managing Owner s President and Director of Fund Administration (who, in these capacities, function as the Principal
Executive Officers and Principal Financial Accounting/Officer, respectively, of the Registrant), as appropriate to allow for timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  

In
designing and evaluating the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures, the Managing Owner recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of the controls can prove absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Registrant have been detected.  

The
Managing Owner s management, under the supervision and with the participation of certain officers of the Managing Owner
(including the Managing Owner s President and Director of Fund Administration), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant s
disclosure controls and procedures during the Third Quarter 2016. Based upon such evaluation, the Managing Owner s President
and Director of Fund Administration have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Registrant s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There
have been no changes in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a   15(f)
and 15d   15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Third Quarter 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting.

Prior
to December 1, 2008, the Registrant was a publicly offered commodity pool and the Managing Owner was required to hold an
interest in the Registrant; therefore, sales of the Managing Owner s interest qualified as unregistered sales of securities.
From December 1, 2008 through September 30, 2016, all sales of interest qualify as unregistered sales due to the Registrant
offered as a private placement. The aggregate sale of Units in this time period was approximately 0.000 Units amounting to approximately
$0.
