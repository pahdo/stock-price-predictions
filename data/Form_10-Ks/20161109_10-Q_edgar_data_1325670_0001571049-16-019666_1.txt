  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

  September 30, 2016  

1.     ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Southern National Bancorp of Virginia,
Inc. ( Southern National  or  SNBV ) is a corporation formed on July 28, 2004 under the laws of the Commonwealth
of Virginia and is the holding company for Sonabank ( Sonabank ) a Virginia state chartered bank which commenced operations
on April 14, 2005. Sonabank provides a range of financial services to individuals and small and medium sized businesses. Sonabank
has fifteen branches in Virginia, located in Fairfax County (Reston, McLean and Fairfax), in Charlottesville, Warrenton (2), Middleburg,
Leesburg (2), South Riding, Front Royal, New Market, Haymarket, Richmond and Clifton Forge, and eight branches in Maryland, in
Rockville, Shady Grove, Frederick, Bethesda, Upper Marlboro, Brandywine, Owings and Huntingtown. 

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc. and its subsidiary. Significant inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U. S. GAAP ) for interim financial
information and instructions for Form 10-Q and follow general practice within the banking industry. Accordingly, the unaudited
consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U. S. GAAP for complete financial
statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary for
a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in Southern National s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Material estimates that are
particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the
carrying value of investment securities, other than temporary impairment of investment securities, the valuation of goodwill and
intangible assets, the FDIC indemnification asset, mortgage servicing rights, other real estate owned and deferred tax assets. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In September 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-12,  Compensation Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could
Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period . The amendments clarify the proper method of accounting for share-based payments
when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. This ASU requires
that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance
condition. The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost
should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent
the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The amendments in
this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier
adoption is permitted. This ASU did not significantly impact SNBV. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  Under the ASU, an entity presents debt issuance costs in the
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported
as interest expense. For public entities, the amendments in ASU 2015-03 were effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. SNBV has adopted the provisions of these amendments, and they have no
impact on its financial reporting. 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis .  The amendments modify the evaluation
reporting organizations must perform to determine if certain legal entities should be consolidated as VIEs. Specifically, the amendments:
(1) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs )
or voting interest entities; (2) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; (3)
affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements
and related party relationships; and (4) provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests
in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule
2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU No. 2015-02 became effective for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. SNBV has adopted the provisions of these amendments, and they have
no impact on its financial reporting. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU
2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments . The amendments
in ASU 2015-16 require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to estimated amounts that are identified during the measurement period
in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments require that the acquirer record, in the
same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects,
if any, as a result of the change to the estimated amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition
date. The amendments also require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes
the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting
periods if the adjustment to the estimated amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  The amendments in this
ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective
date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. Adoption of these amendments had no
impact on SNBV s consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-1,
 Financial Instruments Overall (Topic 825): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The
amendments in ASU 2016-1: (a) require equity investments (except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting
or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net
income; (b) simplify the impairment assessment of equity securities without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative
assessment to identify impairment; (c) eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method and significant
assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost
on the balance sheet; (d) require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial
instruments for disclosure purposes; (e) require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income, the portion of
the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity
has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (f) require
separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets on the
balance sheet or the notes to the financial statements; and (g) clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation
allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred
tax assets. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. SNBV is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases
(Topic 842) . The FASB issued this ASU to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets
and lease liabilities on the balance sheet by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP and
disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for
annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application of this ASU
is permitted for all entities. SNBV is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07 ,
Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting .
The amendments eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase
in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained
earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the
investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest
in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting
as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The amendments require that an entity that has an
available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized
holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity
method. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increase the level of ownership
interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Early adoption is permitted. SNBV is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting the amendments on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 ,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) 
( ASU 2016-08 ), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue
recognition standard. ASU 2016-08 clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e. the specified good or service)
for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The amendments
in ASU 2016-08 affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , and have similar effective
dates and transition requirements (i.e., effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods therein). SNBV is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition guidance on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU
2016-09 ), which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including
the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early application is permitted. SNBV is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In June 2016 ,
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses
(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ), which  sets
forth a  current expected credit loss  ( CECL ) model requiring the Company to measure all expected
credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable
supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on
financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. For public business entities
that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filers, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. SNBV is currently assessing the impact
of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements   .  

During August 2016, the FASB issued new
guidance related to the  Statement of Cash Flows  in ASU 2016-15. The new guidance clarifies the classification within
the statement of cash flows for certain transactions, including debt extinguishment costs, zero-coupon debt, contingent consideration
related to business combinations, insurance proceeds, equity method distributions and beneficial interests in securitizations.
The guidance also clarifies that cash flows with aspects of multiple classes of cash flows or that cannot be separated by source
or use should be classified based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flows for the item.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The
adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 

2.     STOCK- BASED COMPENSATION     

In 2004, the Board of Directors adopted
a stock option plan that authorized the reservation of up to 302,500 shares of common stock and provided for the granting of stock
options to certain directors, officers and employees. The 2010 Stock Awards and Incentive Plan was approved by the Board of Directors
in January 2010 and approved by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting in April 2010. The 2010 plan authorized the reservation
of an additional 700,000 shares of common stock for the granting of stock awards. The options granted to officers and employees
are incentive stock options and the options granted to non-employee directors are non-qualified stock options. The purpose of the
plan is to afford key employees an incentive to remain in the employ of Southern National and to assist in the attracting and retaining
of non-employee directors by affording them an opportunity to share in Southern National s future success. Under the plan,
the option s price cannot be less than the fair market value of the stock on the grant date. The maximum term of the options
is ten years and options granted may be subject to a graded vesting schedule. 

Southern National granted 136,000 options
during the first nine months of 2016. The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
options-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value options granted in the nine months ended September
30, 2016: 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
stock-based compensation expense was $62 thousand and $198 thousand, respectively, compared to $82 thousand and $252 thousand for
the same periods last year. As of September 30, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense associated with the stock options was $513
thousand, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years. 

A summary of the activity in the stock option plan during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 follows (dollars in thousands): 

3.        SECURITIES   

The amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities
and the related gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows (in
thousands): 

The amortized cost, unrecognized gains and losses, and fair
value of securities held to maturity were as follows (in thousands): 

The amortized cost amounts are net of recognized other than
temporary impairment. 

The fair value and carrying amount, if
different, of debt securities as of September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity were as follows (in thousands). Securities not
due at a single maturity date, primarily mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, are shown separately. 

Securities with a carrying amount of approximately
$75.2 million and $89.7 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits,
certain other deposits and a line of credit for advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB ). 

Southern National monitors the portfolio
for indicators of other than temporary impairment. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, certain securities  fair
values were below cost. As outlined in the table below, there were securities with fair values totaling approximately $24.6 million
in the portfolio with the carrying value exceeding the estimated fair value that are considered temporarily impaired at September
30, 2016. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and market illiquidity, and not credit
quality, and because we do not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that we will not be required to sell the
securities before their anticipated recovery, management does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired
as of September 30, 2016. The following tables present information regarding securities in a continuous unrealized loss position
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands) by duration of time in a loss position: 

As of September 30, 2016, we owned pooled trust preferred securities
as follows: 

(1)  Pre-tax, and represents unrealized losses at date of transfer
from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, net of accretion 

Each of these securities has been evaluated
for other than temporary impairment. In performing a detailed cash flow analysis of each security, Sonabank works with independent
third parties to estimate expected cash flows and assist with the evaluation of other than temporary impairment. The cash flow
analyses performed included the following assumptions: 

.5% of the remaining performing collateral will default or defer per annum.   

Recoveries of 7% with a two year lag on all defaults and deferrals.   

No prepayments for 10 years and then 1% per annum for the remaining life of the security.   

Our securities have been modeled using the above assumptions by independent third parties using the forward LIBOR curve to
discount projected cash flows to present values.   

We recognized no OTTI charges during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The following table presents a roll forward
of the credit losses on our securities previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as available for sale recognized
in earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

4.     LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES   

The following table summarizes the composition of our loan portfolio
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

(1)  Covered Loans were acquired in the Greater Atlantic transaction
and are covered under an FDIC loss-share agreement. The agreement covering non-single family loans expired in December 2014. 

Accounting policy related to the allowance
for loan losses is considered a critical policy given the level of estimation, judgment, and uncertainty in the levels of the allowance
required to account for the inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio and the material effect such estimation, judgment, and
uncertainty can have on the consolidated financial results. 

As part of the Greater Atlantic acquisition,
the Bank and the FDIC entered into loss sharing agreements on approximately $143.4 million (contractual basis) of Greater Atlantic
Bank s assets.  There were two agreements with the FDIC, one for single family loans which is a 10-year agreement expiring
in December 2019, and one for non-single family (commercial) assets which was a 5-year agreement which expired in December 2014.
The Bank will share in the losses on the loans and foreclosed loan collateral with the FDIC as specified in the loss sharing agreements;
we refer to these assets collectively as  covered assets.   Loans that are not covered in the loss sharing agreement
are referred to as  non-covered loans . As of September 30, 2016, non-covered loans included $24.6 million of loans
acquired in the HarVest acquisition and $45.1 million acquired in the PGFSB acquisition. 

Accretable discount on the acquired Greater
Atlantic loans, the PGFSB loans and the HarVest loans was $6.6 million and $7.9 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 respectively. 

Credit-impaired covered loans are those
loans which presented evidence of credit deterioration at the date of acquisition and it is probable that Southern National would
not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. Generally, acquired loans that meet Southern National s
definition for nonaccrual status fell within the definition of credit-impaired covered loans. 

Impaired loans for the covered and non-covered portfolios were
as follows (in thousands): 

(1)  Recorded investment is after cumulative prior charge offs
of $2.4 million. These loans also have aggregate SBA guarantees of $1.7 million. 

(2)  Includes loans secured by farmland and multi-family residential
loans. 

(3)  The Bank recognizes loan impairment and may concurrently
record a charge off to the allowance for loan losses. 

(4)  Includes home equity lines of credit. 

(1)  Recorded investment is after cumulative prior charge offs
of $1.2 million. These loans also have aggregate SBA guarantees of $3.5 million. 

(2)  Includes loans secured by farmland and multi-family residential
loans. 

(3)  The Bank recognizes loan impairment and may concurrently
record a charge off to the allowance for loan losses.

Troubled Debt Restructurings   

A modification is classified as a troubled
debt restructuring ( TDR ) if both of the following exist: (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and
(2) the Bank has granted a concession to the borrower. The Bank determines that a borrower may be experiencing financial difficulty
if the borrower is currently delinquent on any of its debt, or if the Bank is concerned that the borrower may not be able to perform
in accordance with the current terms of the loan agreement in the foreseeable future. Many aspects of the borrower s financial
situation are assessed when determining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty, particularly as it relates to commercial
borrowers due to the complex nature of the loan structure, business/industry risk and borrower/guarantor structures. Concessions
may include the reduction of an interest rate at a rate lower than current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, extension
of the maturity date, reduction of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. When evaluating whether a concession has been granted,
the Bank also considers whether the borrower has provided additional collateral or guarantors and whether such additions adequately
compensate the Bank for the restructured terms, or if the revised terms are consistent with those currently being offered to new
loan customers. The assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing (or is likely to experience) financial difficulty and whether
a concession has been granted is subjective in nature and management s judgment is required when determining whether a modification
is a TDR. 

Although each occurrence is unique to the
borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, TDRs are typically modified through reduction in interest rates,
reductions in payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions in term maturity. 

During the three and nine months ending
September 30, 2016, there were no loans modified in troubled debt restructurings. One TDR which had been modified in 2013 defaulted
during the second quarter of 2015. This loan, in the amount of $692 thousand, was current as of September 30, 2016. 

During the three and nine months ending
September 30, 2015, there were no loans modified in troubled debt restructurings. One TDR which had been modified in 2013 defaulted
during the second quarter of 2015. 

Credit Quality Indicators   

Through its system of internal controls
Southern National evaluates and segments loan portfolio credit quality on a quarterly basis using regulatory definitions for Special
Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Special Mention loans are considered to be criticized. Substandard and Doubtful loans are considered
to be classified. Southern National had no loans classified Doubtful at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

Special Mention loans are loans that have
a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result
in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position. 

Substandard loans may be inadequately protected
by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined
weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the
institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful loans have all the weaknesses
inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in
full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and based on
the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows (in thousands): 

(1)  Credit quality is enhanced by a loss sharing agreement
with the FDIC in the covered portfolio. The same credit quality indicators used in the non-covered portfolio are combined. 

(2)  Includes loans secured by farmland and multi-family residential
loans. 

(4)  Includes home equity lines of credit. 

The amount of foreclosed residential real
estate property held at September 30, 2016 was $3.4 million. The recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized
by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure was $893 thousand at September 30, 2016. 

5.     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK   

Southern National is a party to financial
instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial
instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve elements of credit and
funding risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Letters of credit are written conditional commitments
issued by Southern National to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters
of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. We had letters of credit outstanding totaling
$6.4 million and $6.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Our exposure to credit loss in the event
of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based
on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations
as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial
instruments with credit risk. 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements
to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments are made predominately
for adjustable rate loans, and generally have fixed expiration dates of up to three months or other termination clauses and usually
require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts
do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, we had unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds totaling $140.3 million and $132.3 million, respectively.
We had approved loan commitments of $7.6 million and $2.7 million at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. Virtually
all of our unfunded lines of credit, undisbursed construction loan funds and approved loan commitments are variable rate. 

6.      Earnings
Per Share    

The following is a reconciliation of the denominators of the
basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) computations (dollars in thousands, except per share data): 

There were 684,604 and 702,027 anti-dilutive
options and warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. There were 662,399 and 662,298 anti-dilutive
options and warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

7.     FAIR VALUE   

ASC 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted)
for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date 

Level 2: Significant other observable
inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not
active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data 

Level 3: Significant unobservable
inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
an asset or liability 

The following is a description of the valuation
methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to
the valuation hierarchy: 

Securities Available for Sale  

Where quoted prices are available in an
active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities would include highly liquid
government bonds, mortgage products and exchange traded equities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are
estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flow. Level 2 securities
would include U. S. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions and certain
corporate, asset-backed and other securities. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs
to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Currently, all of Southern National s
available-for-sale debt securities are considered to be Level 2 securities. 

Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized
below: 

Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-recurring Basis:  

Impaired Loans   

Generally, we measure the impairment for
impaired loans considering the fair value of the loan s collateral (if the loan is collateral dependent). Fair value of the
loan s collateral is determined by an independent appraisal or evaluation less estimated costs related to selling the collateral.
In some cases appraised value is net of costs to sell. Estimated selling costs range from 6% to 10% of collateral valuation at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Fair value is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-covered loans identified
as impaired totaled $12.9 million (including SBA guarantees of $1.7 million) as of September 30, 2016 with an allocated allowance
for loan losses totaling $800 thousand compared to a carrying amount of $13.5 million (including SBA guarantees of $3.5 million)
with an allocated allowance for loan losses totaling $839 thousand at December 31, 2015. 

Other Real Estate Owned (OREO)  

OREO is evaluated at the time of acquisition
and recorded at fair value as determined by independent appraisal or evaluation less cost to sell. In some cases appraised value
is net of costs to sell. Selling costs have been in the range from 6% to 7.6% of collateral valuation at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. Fair value is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. OREO is further evaluated quarterly for any
additional impairment. At September 30, 2016, the total amount of non-covered OREO was $9.3 million and we had no covered OREO.
As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of OREO was $10.1 million, and covered OREO was $343 thousand. 

Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized
below: 

(1) Includes loans secured by farmland and multi-family residential
loans. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The carrying amount, estimated fair values and fair value hierarchy
levels (previously defined) of financial instruments were as follows (in thousands): 

Carrying amount is the estimated fair value
for cash and cash equivalents, equity investment in mortgage affiliate, preferred investment in mortgage affiliate, accrued interest
receivable and payable, demand deposits, savings accounts, money market accounts, short-term debt, and variable rate loans that
reprice frequently and fully. For fixed rate loans or deposits and for variable rate loans with infrequent repricing or repricing
limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life. A discount for liquidity
risk was not considered necessary in estimating the fair value of loans. It was not practicable to determine the fair value of
Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. Carrying amount is the
estimated fair value for the equity investment and the preferred investment in the mortgage affiliate. Fair value of long-term
debt is based on current rates for similar financing. The fair value of the FDIC indemnification asset was determined by discounting
estimated future cash flows using the long-term risk free rate plus a premium and represents the present value of our current expectation
for recoveries from the FDIC on covered loans. The fair value of off-balance-sheet items is not considered material. The fair value
of loans is not presented on an exit price basis. 

8.      SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE AND
OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS   

Other short-term borrowings can consist
of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) overnight advances, other FHLB advances maturing within one year, federal funds purchased and,
until the second quarter of 2016, securities sold under agreements to repurchase that mature within one year, which are secured
transactions with customers. During the second quarter of 2016, we discontinued offering securities sold under agreements to repurchase
and transferred those accounts into interest-bearing cash management accounts.

business with us, including the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans according to their terms or a change in the value
of the related collateral;   

changes in the availability of funds resulting in increased costs or reduced liquidity;   

a deterioration or downgrade in the credit quality and credit agency ratings of the securities in our securities portfolio;   

impairment concerns and risks related to our investment portfolio of collateralized mortgage obligations, agency mortgage-backed
securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions and pooled trust preferred securities;   

the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on
our results of operations;   

increased credit risk in our assets and increased operating risk caused by a material change in commercial, consumer and/or
real estate loans as a percentage of our total loan portfolio;   

the concentration of our loan portfolio in loans collateralized by real estate;   

our level of construction and land development and commercial real estate loans;   

changes in the levels of loan prepayments and the resulting effects on the value of our loan portfolio;   

the failure of assumptions and estimates underlying the establishment of and provisions made to the allowance for loan losses;   

our ability to expand and grow our business and operations, including the establishment of additional branches and acquisition
of additional branches and banks, and our ability to realize the cost savings and revenue enhancements we expect from such activities;   

changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, or changes in interest rates and market prices, which could reduce our net interest margins, asset valuations and
expense expectations;   

increased competition for deposits and loans adversely affecting rates and terms;   

the continued service of key management personnel;   

the potential payment of interest on demand deposit accounts to effectively compete for customers;   

potential environmental liability risk associated with lending activities;   

increased asset levels and changes in the composition of assets and the resulting impact on our capital levels and regulatory
capital ratios;

to achieve expected gains, revenue growth or expense savings;   

legislative and regulatory changes, including changes in banking, securities and tax laws and regulations and their application
by our regulators, including those associated with the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank
Act ) and changes in the scope and cost of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insurance and other
coverage;   

increases in regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations generally, which may adversely affect our ability to
expand our business or could cause us to shrink our business;   

the effects of war or other conflicts, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events that may affect general economic conditions;   

changes in accounting policies, rules and practices and applications or determinations made thereunder;   

the risk that our deferred tax assets could be reduced if future taxable income is less than currently estimated, if corporate

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Net Income  

Net income for the quarter ended September
30, 2016 was $2.8 million and $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. That compares to $2.5 million and $7.0
million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Interest Income  

Our operating results depend primarily
on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets such as loans
and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. 

Net interest income was $10.4 million in
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $9.2 million during the same period last year. Average loans during the third
quarter of 2016 were $907.3 million compared to $777.0 million during the same period last year. Sonabank s net interest
margin was 4.04% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 3.87% in the third quarter of 2015. The accretion of the discount on
loans acquired in the acquisitions of Greater Atlantic Bank, HarVest and Prince Georges Federal Savings Bank (PGFSB) contributed
$536 thousand to net interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $573 thousand during the third
quarter of 2015. 

Net interest income was $30.3 million during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $27.1 million during the comparable period in the prior year. Average loans
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $879.6 million compared to $747.5 million during the same period last year.
Sonabank s net interest margin was 4.05% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 4.07% during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The loan discount accretions on our three acquisitions were $1.6 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $2.0 million in the same period last year. 

The following tables detail average balances
of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the amount of interest earned/paid on such assets and liabilities,
and the yield/rate for the periods indicated: 

(1) Includes loan fees in both interest income and the calculation
of the yield on loans. 

 (2) Calculations include non-accruing loans in average loan
amounts outstanding. 

(1) Includes loan fees in both interest income and the calculation
of the yield on loans. 

 (2) Calculations include non-accruing loans in average loan
amounts outstanding. 

Provision for Loan Losses  

The provision for loan losses is a current
charge to earnings made in order to increase the allowance for loan losses to a level for inherent probable losses in the loan
portfolio based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of lending,
historical loan experience and other known internal and external factors affecting loan collectability. Our loan loss allowance
is calculated by segmenting the loan portfolio by loan type and applying risk factors to each segment. The risk factors are determined
by considering historical loss data, peer data, as well as applying management s judgment. 

The loan loss provision for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 was $2.1 million, compared to $850 thousand for the same period last year. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the loan loss provision was $4.1 million compared to $2.9 million for the same period last year. Charge offs for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $2.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively. Charge offs for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $766 thousand and $2.4 million, respectively. The provision for loan losses and charge-offs
remained elevated for both the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 because of the default of a single borrower.
The borrower was an 18 year old company which had been a client for over ten years. We have receivables and real estate collateral.
We are collecting on the receivables and will litigate if necessary. We have sold the real estate at a foreclosure auction which
is the primary cause of the increase in other assets and other liabilities from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. A portion
of the funds we expect to receive will be remitted to a participant in the loan. We believe this is largely behind us. 

Noninterest Income   

The following table presents the major categories of noninterest
income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

During the third quarter of 2016 Sonabank
had noninterest income of $1.2 million compared to noninterest income of $964 thousand during the third quarter of 2015. We recognized
income from our investment in STM, our mortgage affiliate, in the amount of $749 thousand compared to $492 thousand during the
same quarter last year. The increase was due to increased loan volume by STM which increased their net income for the quarter ending
September 30, 2016. 

Noninterest
income decreased to $2.7 million in the first nine months of 2016 from $3.1 million in the first nine months of 2015. Much of the
non-interest income in the nine months of 2015 resulted from the fact that we transferred from our held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio
all of the trust preferred securities and a non-government sponsored residential collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) that
had previously been classified as other than temporarily impaired to the available-for-sale (AFS) classification. We sold five
of these trust preferred securities and the CMO recognizing a net gain of $520 thousand in the nine month period ended September
30, 2015 . 

Noninterest Expense  

The following table presents the major categories of noninterest
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Noninterest expenses were $5.4 million
and $17.0 million during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared to $5.6 million and 17.0 million
during the same periods in 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, we had losses of $275 thousand because of impairment recognized
on three OREO properties. This was partially offset by gains on the sale of four properties in the amount of $201 thousand, resulting
in a net loss of $74 thousand. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we had losses on Other Real Estate Owned (OREO)
of $640 thousand because of impairment recognized on five OREO properties. This was partially offset by gains on the sale of two
properties in the amount of $280 thousand, resulting in a net loss of $360 thousand. Employee compensation increased by $222 thousand
compared to the first nine months of 2015, due to increases in the normal course of business. 

The efficiency ratio improved from 55.90% during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 to 51.41% during the first nine months of 2016. This ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expenses
excluding net gains or losses on OREO by net interest income plus noninterest income excluding gains/losses on the sale of assets
and impairment losses recognized in earnings. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION  

Balance Sheet Overview   

Total assets were $1.1 billion as of September
30, 2016 compared to $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2015. Net loans receivable increased from $821.0 million at the end of 2015
to $904.4 million at September 30, 2016. 

Total deposits were $915.3 million at September
30, 2016 compared to $825.3 million at December 31, 2015. Certificates of deposit increased $70.3 million during the nine months.
Noninterest-bearing deposits were $91.6 million at September 30, 2016 and $83.8 million at December 31, 2015. 

Loan Portfolio  

As part of the Greater Atlantic acquisition,
the Bank and the FDIC entered into loss sharing agreements on approximately $143.4 million (contractual basis) of Greater Atlantic
Bank s assets.  There were two agreements with the FDIC, one for single family loans which is a 10-year agreement expiring
in December 2019, and one for non-single family (commercial) assets which was a 5-year agreement which expired in December 2014.
The Bank will share in the losses on the loans and foreclosed loan collateral with the FDIC as specified in the loss sharing agreements;
we refer to these assets collectively as  covered assets.   Loans that are not covered in the loss sharing agreement
are referred to as  non-covered loans . As of September 30, 2016, non-covered loans included $24.6 million of loans
acquired in the HarVest acquisition and $45.1 million acquired in the PGFSB acquisition. 

The following table summarizes the composition
of our loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

(1) Covered Loans were acquired in the Greater Atlantic transaction
and are covered under an FDIC loss-share agreement. The agreement covering non-single family loans expired in December 2014. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, substantially all of our loans were to customers located in Virginia and Maryland. We are not dependent on any single customer
or group of customers whose insolvency would have a material adverse effect on operations. 

Loan growth slowed during the third quarter
of 2016. After growing 4.97% during the first quarter and 4.10% during the second, third quarter growth was only 0.72%. Originations
remained strong, but we experienced higher than normal prepayments. One $8 million loan was refinanced in the third quarter of
2016 with a specialized lender without recourse despite having to pay us a prepayment penalty of over $300 thousand. 

Asset Quality  

We will generally place a loan on nonaccrual
status when it becomes 90 days past due. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether
the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash payments received while a loan is categorized as nonaccrual
will be recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to future collections. 

We maintain appraisals on loans secured
by real estate, particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans. In instances where appraisals
reflect reduced collateral values, we make an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition to determine the need,
if any, for impairment or write-down to their fair values. If foreclosure occurs, we record other real estate owned at the lower
of our recorded investment in the loan or fair value less our estimated costs to sell. 

Our loss and delinquency experience on
our loan portfolio has been limited by a number of factors, including our underwriting standards and the relatively short period
of time since the loans were originated. Whether our loss and delinquency experience in the area of our portfolio will increase
significantly depends upon the value of the real estate securing loans and economic factors such as the overall economy of the
region. 

Non-covered Loans and Assets  

Non-covered OREO as of September 30, 2016
was $9.3 million compared to $10.1 million as of the end of the previous year. During the first nine months of 2016 we disposed
of two non-covered properties, and there were no transfers from loans to OREO. 

Non-covered nonaccrual loans were $3.9
million, of which $1.7 million were fully covered by SBA guarantees at September 30, 2016 compared to $4.2 million ($3.5 million
of which were loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) at the end of last year. The ratio of non-covered non-performing assets (excluding
the SBA guaranteed loans) to non-covered assets improved from 1.07% at the end of 2015 to 1.04% at September 30, 2016. The portions
of these SBA loans that were unguaranteed were charged off. 

We have an internal loan review and a loan
committee, both of which provide on-going monitoring to identify and address issues with problem loans. The loan loss provision
is determined after consideration of all known relevant internal and external factors affecting loan collectability to maintain
the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level necessary to absorb estimated credit losses. Our allowance for loan losses as
a percentage of non-covered total loans at September 30, 2016 was 0.96%, compared to 1.06% at the end of 2015. Management believes
the allowance is adequate at this time but continues to monitor trends in environmental factors which may potentially affect future
losses. 

The following table presents a comparison
of non-covered nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 

A modification is classified as a troubled
debt restructuring ( TDR ) if both of the following exist: (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and
(2) the Bank has granted a concession to the borrower. The Bank determines that a borrower may be experiencing financial difficulty
if the borrower is currently delinquent on any of its debt, or if the Bank is concerned that the borrower may not be able to perform
in accordance with the current terms of the loan agreement in the foreseeable future. Many aspects of the borrower s financial
situation are assessed when determining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty, particularly as it relates to commercial
borrowers due to the complex nature of the loan structure, business/industry risk and borrower/guarantor structures. Concessions
may include the reduction of an interest rate at a rate lower than current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, extension
of the maturity date, reduction of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. When evaluating whether a concession has been granted,
the Bank also considers whether the borrower has provided additional collateral or guarantors and whether such additions adequately
compensate the Bank for the restructured terms, or if the revised terms are consistent with those currently being offered to new
loan customers. The assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing (or is likely to experience) financial difficulty and whether
a concession has been granted is subjective in nature and management s judgment is required when determining whether a modification
is a TDR. 

Although each occurrence is unique to the
borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, TDRs are typically modified through reduction in interest rates,
reductions in payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions in term maturity. 

During the three and nine months ending
September 30, 2016, there were no loans modified in troubled debt restructurings. One TDR which had been modified in 2013 defaulted
during the second quarter of 2015. This loan, in the amount of $692 thousand, was current as of September 30, 2016. 

During the three and nine months ending
September 30, 2015, there were no loans modified in troubled debt restructurings. One TDR which had been modified in 2013 defaulted
during the second quarter of 2015. 

Covered Loans and Assets   

Covered loans identified as impaired totaled
$958 thousand as of September 30, 2016 and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Nonaccrual loans were $512 thousand and $698 thousand
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no loans past
due 90 days or more and accruing interest. 

Securities  

Investment securities, available for sale
and held to maturity, were $90.9 million at September 30, 2016 down from $101.0 million at December 31, 2015. 

Securities in our investment portfolio
as of September 30, 2016 were as follows: 

residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities in the amount of $19.6 million and
residential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations totaling $2.5 million   

callable agency securities in the amount of $48.0 million   

municipal bonds in the amount of $15.1 million with a taxable equivalent yield of 3.33% and ratings
as follows:   

trust preferred securities in the amount of $5.6 million, $3.8 million of which is Alesco VII A1B
which is rated A1 (Moody s), BBB+ (Standard and Poor s) and A (Fitch)   

During the first nine months of 2016, we
purchased $44.0 million of callable agency securities and a fixed rate residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed security
in the amount of $2.0 million. Callable agency securities in the amount of $52.1 million were called during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. 

In the second quarter of 2015, we transferred
seven of the trust preferred securities and a non-government sponsored residential CMO that had been other than temporarily impaired
from the held-to-maturity classification to the available-for-sale classification. We sold five of these trust preferred securities
and the CMO recognizing a net gain of $520 thousand in the second quarter of 2015. The two trust preferred securities we retained
in the AFS classification have a fair value of $1.6 million as of September 30, 2016. We also have two trust preferred securities
that we retained in the HTM classification in the amount of $4.1 million, one of which is the above-mentioned Alesco VII. These
two securities have never been other than temporarily impaired. 

At September 30, 2016, we owned pooled trust preferred securities
as follows (in thousands):  

(1) Pre-tax, and represents unrealized losses at date of transfer
from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, net of accretion 

 (2) Pre-tax 

Each of these securities has been evaluated
for potential impairment under accounting guidelines. In performing a detailed cash flow analysis of each security, Sonabank works
with independent third parties to identify the most reflective estimate of the cash flow estimated to be collected. If this estimate
results in a present value of expected cash flows that is less than the amortized cost basis of a security (that is, credit loss
exists), an OTTI is considered to have occurred. If there is no credit loss, any impairment is considered temporary. 

We recognized no OTTI charges during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Funds Management  

The objective of our liquidity management
is to assure the ability to meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at maturity,
the repayment of borrowings at maturity and the ability to fund commitments and other new business opportunities. We obtain funding
from a variety of sources, including customer deposit accounts, customer certificates of deposit and payments on our loans and
investments. Historically, our level of core deposits has been insufficient to fully fund our lending activities. As a result,
we have sought funding from additional sources, including institutional certificates of deposit and the sale of available-for-sale
investment securities. In addition, we maintain lines of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and utilize securities
sold under agreements to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement borrowings from approved securities dealers. 

We prepare a cash flow forecast for one
year with the first three months prepared on a weekly basis and on a monthly basis thereafter. The projections incorporate expected
cash flows on loans, investments securities, and deposits based on data used to prepare our interest rate risk analyses. To estimate
loan growth over the one year period, the projection incorporates the scheduled loan closings in the Loan Pipeline Report along
with other management estimates. 

We recently purchased liquidity risk software
with which we can monitor our liquidity risk at a point in time and prepare cash flow and funds availability projections over a
two year period. The projections can be run using a base case and several stress levels. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we funded our financial obligations with deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At September 30, 2016, we had $140.3 million of unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed
construction loan funds. Our approved loan commitments were $7.6 million at September 30, 2016. Management anticipates that funding
requirements for these commitments can be met from the normal sources of funds. 

Capital Resources  

The following table provides a comparison of our leverage and
risk-weighted capital ratios and the leverage and risk-weighted capital ratios of the bank at the dates indicated to the minimum
and well-capitalized regulatory standards (dollars in thousands): 

The most recent regulatory notification
categorized Sonabank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or
events since that notification that management believes have changed Sonabank s category. 

Beginning on January 1, 2016, SNBV and
Sonabank must maintain a capital conservation buffer to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments. 
This buffer must consist solely of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity
Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) in addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements.  The capital conservation
buffer required for 2016 is common equity equal to .625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by .625% per year until reaching
2.5% beginning January 1, 2019.   

ITEM 3   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK  

We are engaged primarily in the business
of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings into interest-earning loans and investments. Consequently, our earnings
depend to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income on loans and other
investments and the interest expense on deposits and borrowings. To the extent that our interest-bearing liabilities do not reprice
or mature at the same time as our interest-earning assets, we are subject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations
in net interest income. We have employed asset/liability management policies that seek to manage our interest income, without having
to incur unacceptable levels of credit or investment risk. 

We use simulation modeling to manage our
interest rate risk, and we review quarterly interest sensitivity reports prepared for us by FTN Financial using the Sendero ALM
Analysis System. This approach uses a model which generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity (EVE) over
a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet
contracts using assumptions about estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates. 

The following tables are based on an analysis
prepared by FTN Financial setting forth an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in EVE resulting
from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (plus 400 basis points or minus 200 basis points, measured
in 100 basis point increments) as of September 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015, and all changes are within our ALM Policy
guidelines. 

Our interest rate sensitivity is also monitored
by management through the use of a model run by FTN Financial that generates estimates of the change in the net interest income
over a range of interest rate scenarios. Net interest income depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. In this regard, the model assumes that the composition of our interest
sensitive assets and liabilities existing at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 remains constant over the period being measured
and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration
to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. All changes are within our ALM Policy guidelines. 

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the
methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE requires the making of certain assumptions
that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly,
although the EVE tables and Sensitivity of Net Interest Income (NII) tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure
at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes
in market interest rates on our net worth and net interest income. Sensitivity of EVE and NII are modeled using different assumptions
and approaches. In the low interest rate environment that currently exists, limitations on downward adjustments for interest rates,
particularly as they apply to deposits, can and do result in anomalies in scenarios that are unlikely to occur due to the current
low interest rate environment. 

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures.  As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d -15(c) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that
these controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are
our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in Southern National s internal control over financial reporting that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
