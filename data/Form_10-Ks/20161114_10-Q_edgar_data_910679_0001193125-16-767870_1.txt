  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       

1.  
   BASIS OF PRESENTATION        The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and therefore do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The
results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the entire fiscal year.      

2.  
   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU
2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (a new revenue recognition standard). The Update s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, this Update specifies the accounting for certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure
requirements for revenue recognition. This Update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption
of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.    In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU
2014-12,  Compensation       Stock Compensation   (  Topic 718  ): Accounting for Share-Based Payments when the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service
Period . The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual
periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this Update either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective
date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition
is adopted, the cumulative effect of applying this Update as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance at that date.
Additionally, if retrospective transition is adopted, an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.

Table of Contents  

  In June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-10,  Technical Corrections and Improvements .
The amendments in this Update represent changes to clarify the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Codification ), correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to
have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this Update. The amendments in this Update that require transition guidance
are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the
issuance of this Update. This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  
      10  

Table of Contents  

  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contract with Customers 
( Topic 606 ). The amendments in this Update defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in
ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting Update.  
 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805).  The amendments in this Update require
that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this Update require that the acquirer record,
in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been
completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this Update require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item
that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017. This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10):     Recognition
and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . This Update applies to all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities and is intended to provide more useful information on the recognition, measurement,
presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other things, this Update (a) requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to
be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (b) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (c)
eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities; (d) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and
significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (e) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the
fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (f) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the
instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (g) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities
by measurement category and form of financial

asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (h) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a
valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, including not-for-profit entities and employee benefit plans within the scope of Topics 960 through 965 on plan accounting, the
amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. All entities that are not public business entities may adopt the amendments in
this Update earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial
position or results of operations.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The standard
requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use
asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. A short-term lease is defined as one in which (a) the lease term is 12 months or less and (b) there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee
is reasonably certain to exercise. For short-term leases, lessees may elect to recognize lease payments over the lease term on a straight-line basis. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2020. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual
reporting period. This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.

Table of Contents  

  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606).  The amendments in this Update affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606, which includes entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services (that are an output of the
entity s ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606; they simply clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent
considerations. The amendments in this Update are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Update
2014-09. ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,  defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard
will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) . The amendments in this Update affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The standards in this Update provide simplification for several aspects of
the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as with equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to
nonpublic entities. In addition to those simplifications, the amendments eliminate the guidance in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment . This should
not result in a change in practice  
      13

because the guidance that is being superseded was never effective. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption
is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  
 In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  The amendments in this Update
affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606, which includes entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services in exchange for consideration. The amendments in this Update do not change the
core principle for revenue recognition in Topic 606. Instead, the amendments provide (1) more detailed guidance in a few areas and (2) additional implementation guidance and examples based on feedback the FASB received from its stakeholders.
The amendments are expected to reduce the degree of judgment necessary to comply with Topic 606, which the FASB expects will reduce the potential for diversity arising in practice and reduce the cost and complexity of applying the guidance. The
amendments in this Update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the
effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by Update 2014-09). ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) :  Deferral of the Effective Date , defers the effective date of
Update 2014-09 by one year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.  
 In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which among other things clarifies
the objective of the collectability criterion in Topic 606, as well as certain narrow aspects of Topic 606. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which is not yet
effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by Update 2014-09). ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements

  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses:
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ), which changes the impairment model for most financial assets. This Update is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit
losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The underlying premise of the Update is that financial assets measured at amortized cost should be presented at the net amount expected to
be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The allowance for credit losses should reflect management s current estimate of credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining
life of a financial asset. The income statement will be effected for the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during
the period. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. With certain exceptions, transition to the new
requirements will be through a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the
standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):     Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in
practice. Among these include recognizing cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment as cash outflows for financing activities; cash proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of
the related insurance coverage; and cash proceeds received from the settlement of bank-owned life insurance policies should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities while the cash payments for premiums on bank-owned policies may be
classified as cash outflows for investing activities, operating activities, or a combination of investing and operating activities. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An
entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments
retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s
statement of cash flows.

   EARNINGS PER SHARE        The following table sets forth the computation of the
weighted-average common shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share.      
   There are no convertible securities that would affect the numerator in calculating basic and diluted

   STOCK BASED COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE        The Company s 2008 Stock
Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), which was approved by shareholders in October 2008, permits the grant of stock options or restricted shares to its directors and employees for up to 152,000 shares (up to 38,000 restricted shares may be
issued). Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company s stock at the date of grant; those option awards generally vest over five years of continuous service and have ten-year
contractual terms.    During the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded no compensation expense
related to our share-based compensation awards. As of September 30, 2016, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted in fiscal 2009.  
 The Company had no non-vested stock options outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015. There were no stock options exercised or issued
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

   At September 30, 2016, investment securities with amortized costs of $136.368 million and fair values of
$136.544 million were pledged to secure borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Pittsburgh. Of the securities pledged, $16.881 million of amortized cost was excess collateral at the FHLB. Excess collateral is maintained to support
future borrowings and may be withdrawn by the Company at any time.   As of September 30, 2016, investment securities with amortized
costs of $0.518 million and fair values of $0.523 million were pledged to secure public deposits.    As of September 30, 2016,
investment securities with amortized costs of $2.706 million and fair values of $2.887 million were pledged to secure future borrowings with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC). Since the Company had no FRBC borrowings outstanding on
September 30, 2016, all FRBC collateral pledges may be withdrawn by the Company at any time.    As of September 30, 2016, no
investment securities were pledged to secure broker repurchase agreements.      

6.  
   MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES        Mortgage-backed securities ( MBS )
include mortgage pass-through certificates ( PCs ) and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ). With a pass-through security, investors own an undivided interest in the pool of mortgages that collateralize the
PCs. Principal and interest is passed through to the investor as it is generated by the mortgages underlying the pool. PCs and CMOs may be insured or guaranteed by Freddie Mac ( FHLMC ), Fannie Mae ( FNMA ) and the
Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ). CMOs may also be privately issued with varying degrees of credit enhancements. A CMO reallocates mortgage pool cash flow to a series of bonds (called traunches) with varying
stated maturities, estimated average lives, coupon rates and prepayment characteristics.   The Company s CMO portfolio is
comprised of two segments: CMOs backed by U.S. Government Agencies ( Agency CMOs ) and CMOs backed by single-family whole loans not guaranteed by a U.S. Government Agency ( Private-Label CMOs ).  
 At September 30, 2016, the Company s Agency CMOs totaled $133.0 million as compared to $136.0 million at June 30, 2016. The
Company s private-label CMOs totaled $1.4 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $1.5 million at June 30, 2016. The $3.0 million decrease in the CMO segment of our MBS portfolio was primarily due to repayments on our Agency and
private-label CMOs which totaled $11.0 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received principal payments totaling $126 thousand on its private-label CMOs. At September 30, 2016, approximately $134.4 million or
100.0% (book value) of the Company s MBS portfolio, including CMOs, were comprised of adjustable or floating rate investments, as compared to $137.4 million or 100.0% at June 30, 2016. Substantially all of the Company s floating rate
MBS adjust monthly based upon changes in the one month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company has no investment in multi-family or commercial real estate based MBS.  
 Due to prepayments of the underlying loans, and the prepayment characteristics of the CMO traunches, the actual maturities of the
Company s MBS are expected to be substantially less than the scheduled maturities.    The Company retains an independent third
party to assist it in the determination of a fair value for its three private-label CMOs. This valuation is meant to be a  Level Three  valuation as defined by ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . The valuation
does not represent the actual terms or prices at which any party could purchase the securities. There is currently no active secondary market for private-label CMOs and there can be no assurance that any secondary market for private-label CMOs will
develop. The private-label CMO portfolio had three previously recorded other-than-temporary impairments at September 30, 2016. During the three months ending September 30, 2016, the Company reversed $54 thousand of non-credit unrealized holding
losses on its three private-label CMOs with other than temporary impairments ( OTTI ) due to principal repayments. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded no additional credit impairment charges on
its private-label CMO portfolio.    The Company believes that the data and assumptions used to determine the fair values are
reasonable. The fair value calculations reflect relevant facts and market conditions. Events and conditions occurring after the valuation date could have a material effect on the private-label CMO segment s fair value.  
 The following table sets forth information with respect to the Company s private-label CMO portfolio as of September 30, 2016.
At the time of purchase, all of our private-label CMOs were rated in the highest investment category by at least two ratings agencies.

   At September 30, 2016, mortgage-backed securities with amortized costs of $133.0 million and fair values
of $133.1 million were pledged to secure public deposits and borrowings with the FHLB. Of the securities pledged, $19.2 million of fair value was excess collateral. At June 30, 2016 mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of
$127.6 million and fair values of $127.6 million, were pledged to secure public deposits and borrowings with the FHLB. Of the securities pledged, $16.7 million of fair value was excess collateral. Excess collateral is maintained to support
future borrowings and may be withdrawn by the Company at any time.

   UNREALIZED LOSSES ON SECURITIES        The following tables show the
Company s gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  

For debt securities, impairment is considered to be other than temporary if an entity (1) intends to
sell the security, (2) more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovering its amortized cost basis, or (3) does not expect to recover the security s entire amortized cost basis (even if the entity does not intend to
sell the security). In addition, impairment is considered to be other than temporary if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security is less than the amortized cost basis of the security (any such shortfall is
referred to as a credit loss).    The Company evaluates outstanding available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities in an
unrealized loss position (i.e., impaired securities) for OTTI on a quarterly basis. In doing so, the Company considers many factors including, but not limited to: the credit ratings assigned to the securities by the Nationally Recognized
Statistical Rating Organizations ( NRSRO  other indicators of the credit quality of the issuer; the strength of the provider of any guarantees; the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than amortized cost; and whether
the Company has the intent to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. In the case of its private label residential MBS, the Company also considers prepayment speeds, the
historical and projected performance of the underlying loans and the credit support provided by the subordinate securities. These evaluations are inherently subjective and consider a number of quantitative and qualitative factors.

  The following table presents a roll-forward of the credit loss component of the amortized
cost of mortgage-backed securities that we have written down for OTTI and the credit component of the loss that is recognized in earnings. OTTI recognized in earnings for credit impaired mortgage-backed securities is presented as additions in two
components based upon whether the current period is the first time the mortgage-backed security was credit-impaired (initial credit impairment) or is not the first time the mortgage-backed security was credit impaired (subsequent credit
impairments). The credit loss component is reduced if we sell, intend to sell or believe that we will be required to sell previously credit-impaired mortgage-backed securities. Additionally, the credit loss component is reduced if we receive cash
flows in excess of what we expected to receive over the remaining life of the credit impaired mortgage-backed securities, the security matures or is fully written down.

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded no credit impairment charge and
no non-credit unrealized holding loss to accumulated other comprehensive income. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company accreted back into other comprehensive income $22 thousand (net of income tax effect of $11
thousand), based on principal repayments on private-label CMOs previously identified with OTTI.    In the case of its private-label
residential CMOs that exhibit adverse risk characteristics, the Company employs models to determine the cash flows that it is likely to collect from the securities. These models consider borrower characteristics and the particular attributes of the
loans underlying the securities, in conjunction with assumptions about future changes in home prices and interest rates, to predict the likelihood a loan will default and the impact on default frequency, loss severity and remaining credit
enhancement. A significant input to these models is the forecast of future housing price changes for the relevant states and metropolitan statistical areas, which are based upon an assessment of the various housing markets. In general, since the
ultimate receipt of contractual payments on these securities will depend upon the credit and prepayment performance of the underlying loans and, if needed, the credit enhancements for the senior securities owned by the Company, the Company uses
these models to assess whether the credit enhancement associated with each security is sufficient to protect against likely losses of principal and interest on the underlying mortgage loans. The development of the modeling assumptions requires
significant judgment.    In conjunction with our adoption of ASC Topic 820 effective June 30, 2009, the Company retained an
independent third party to assist it with assessing its investments within the private-label CMO portfolio. The independent third party utilized certain assumptions for producing the cash flow analyses used in the OTTI assessment. Key assumptions
would include interest rates, expected market participant spreads and discount rates, housing prices, projected future delinquency levels and assumed loss rates on any liquidated collateral.  
      23  

Table of Contents  

  The Company reviewed the independent third party s assumptions used in the September
30, 2016 OTTI process. Based on the results of this review, the Company deemed the independent third party s assumptions to be reasonable and adopted them. However, different assumptions could produce materially different results, which could
impact the Company s conclusions as to whether an impairment is considered other-than-temporary and the magnitude of the credit loss. Management believes that no additional private-label CMOs in the portfolio had an other-than-temporary
impairment at September 30, 2016, keeping the total at three private-label CMOs with OTTI at September 30, 2016.    If the Company
intends to sell an impaired debt security, or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the impairment is other-than-temporary and is recognized currently in earnings in an amount equal
to the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost. The Company does not anticipate selling its private-label CMO portfolio, nor does Management believe that the Company will be required to sell these securities before recovery of this
amortized cost basis.    In instances in which the Company determines that a credit loss exists but the Company does not intend to
sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis, the OTTI is separated into (1) the amount of the total impairment
related to the credit loss and (2) the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors (i.e., the noncredit portion). The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings and the amount of the total OTTI
related to all other factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The total OTTI is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income with an offset for the amount of the total OTTI that is recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive loss. Absent the intent or requirement to sell a security, if a credit loss does not exist, any impairment is considered to be temporary.  
 Regardless of whether an OTTI is recognized in its entirety in earnings or if the credit portion is recognized in earnings and the
noncredit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), the estimation of fair values has a significant impact on the amount(s) of any impairment that is recorded.  
 The noncredit portion of any OTTI losses on securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted to fair value with an offsetting
adjustment to the carrying value of the security. The fair value adjustment could increase or decrease the carrying value of the security. All of the Company s private-label CMOs were originally, and continue to be classified, as held to
maturity.    In periods subsequent to the recognition of an OTTI loss, the other-than-temporarily impaired debt security is accounted
for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the OTTI at an amount equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the credit-related OTTI recognized in earnings. For debt securities for which credit-related OTTI is recognized in
earnings, the difference between the new cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the security in a prospective manner based on the amount and timing of future estimated cash
flows.    The Company had investments in 46 positions that were temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016. Based on its
analysis, management has concluded that three private-label CMOs are other-than-temporarily impaired, while the remaining securities portfolio has experienced unrealized losses and a decrease in fair value due to interest rate volatility,
illiquidity in the marketplace, or credit deterioration in the U.S. mortgage markets.

   LOANS AND RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES        The following table
summarizes the primary segments of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.      
   Impaired loans are loans for which it is probable the Company will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The following loan categories are collectively evaluated for impairment. First mortgage loans: 1   4 family dwellings and all consumer loan categories (home equity, home equity
lines of credit, and other). The following loan categories are individually evaluated for impairment. First mortgage loans: construction, land acquisition and development, multi-family dwellings, and commercial. The Company evaluates commercial
loans not secured by real property individually for impairment.    The definition of  impaired loans  is not the same as the
definition of  nonaccrual loans,  although the two categories overlap. The Company may choose to place a loan on nonaccrual status due to payment delinquency or uncertain collectability, while not classifying the loan as impaired if the
loan is not a commercial or commercial real estate loan. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status and collateral value. The amount of impairment for these types of impaired loans is determined by the
difference between the present value of the expected cash flows related to the loan, using the original interest rate, and its recorded value, or as a practical expedient in the case of collateralized loans, the difference between the fair value of
the collateral and the recorded amount of the loans. When foreclosure is probable, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral.  
 Loans that experience insignificant payment delays, which are defined as 90 days or less, generally are not classified as impaired.
Management determines the significance of payment delays on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration all circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the
amount of shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.

The Company s loan portfolio also includes troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), where economic
concessions have been granted to borrowers who have experienced or are expected to experience financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Company s loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the
interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructure and may only be returned to performing status after considering the
borrower s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months.    During the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no trouble debt restructurings, and no trouble debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted.

  When the Company modifies a loan, management evaluates any possible impairment based on the
present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, except when the sole (remaining) source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the collateral. In
these cases, management uses the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, instead of discounted cash flows. If management determines that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (net of
previous charge-offs, deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), impairment is recognized by segment or class of loan, as applicable, through an allowance estimate or a charge-off to the allowance. Segment and class
status is determined by the loan s classification at origination.    The allowance for loan losses is established through
provisions for loan losses charged against income. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance is maintained at a level
believed adequate by management to absorb estimated potential loan losses. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio considering past experience, current economic
conditions, composition of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.  
 Effective December 13, 2006, the FDIC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies adopted a Revised Interagency Policy
Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses ( ALLL ). The revised policy statement revised and replaced the banking agencies  1993 policy statement on the ALLL. The revised policy statement provides that an institution must
maintain an ALLL at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired, as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio. The banking
agencies also revised the policy to ensure consistency with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). The revised policy statement updates the previous guidance that describes the responsibilities of the board of directors,
management, and bank examiners regarding the ALLL, factors to be considered in the estimation of the ALLL, and the objectives and elements of an effective loan review system.  
 Federal regulations require that each insured savings institution classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection
with examinations of insured institutions, federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three classifications for problem assets:  substandard ,  doubtful  and
 loss . Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses
of those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An
asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. Another category designated  asset watch  is also utilized by the Bank for assets which do not
currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification as substandard, doubtful or loss. Assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish general allowances for loan losses.
If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, the insured institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of 100% of the portion of the asset classified loss, or charge-off such amount. General loss
allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful may be included in determining an institution s regulatory capital, while specific valuation allowances for loan losses do not qualify as
regulatory capital.    The Company s general policy is to internally classify its assets on a regular basis and establish prudent
general valuation allowances that are adequate to absorb losses that have not been identified but that are inherent in the loan portfolio. The Company maintains general valuation allowances that it believes are adequate to absorb losses in its loan
portfolio that are not clearly attributable to specific loans. The Company s general valuation allowances are within the following general ranges: (1) 0% to 5% of assets subject to special mention; (2) 1.00% to 100% of assets classified
substandard; and (3) 50% to 100% of assets classified doubtful. Any loan classified as loss is charged-off. To further monitor and assess the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, loan delinquencies are reviewed to consider any developing
problem loans. Based upon the procedures in place, considering the Company s past charge-offs and recoveries and assessing the current risk elements in the portfolio, management believes the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016, is
adequate.

    Credit quality information    
 The following tables represent credit exposure by internally assigned grades for the period ended September 30, 2016. The grading
system analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled or not at all. The Company s internal credit risk grading system is based on experiences with similarly
graded loans.    The Company s internally assigned grades are as follows:  
 Pass   loans which are protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the underlying
collateral.    Special Mention   loans where a potential weakness or risk exists, which could cause a more serious problem if not
corrected.    Substandard   loans that have a well-defined weakness based on objective evidence and can be characterized by the
distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.    Doubtful   loans
classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard loan. In addition, these weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, based on existing circumstances.  
 Loss   loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible, or of such value that continuance as a loan is not warranted.  
 The primary credit quality indicator used by management in the 1   4 family and consumer loan portfolios is the performance status
of the loans. Payment activity is reviewed by Management on a monthly basis to determine how loans are performing. Loans are considered to be non-performing when they become 90 days delinquent, have a history of delinquency, or have other
inherent characteristics which Management deems to be weaknesses.    The following tables presents the Company s internally
classified construction, land acquisition and development, multi-family residential, commercial real estate and commercial (not secured by real estate) loans at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.

The following table presents performing and non-performing 1   4 family residential and consumer
loans based on payment activity for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.     
   The Company determines its allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The Company uses a systematic methodology as required by Financial Reporting Release No. 28 and the various Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council guidelines. The Company also endeavors to adhere to SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 102 in connection with loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues.    Our methodology used to determine the
allocated portion of the allowance is as follows. For groups of homogenous loans, we apply a loss rate to the groups  aggregate balance. Our group loss rate reflects our historical loss experience. We may adjust these group rates to compensate
for changes in environmental factors; but our adjustments have not been frequent due to a relatively stable charge-off experience. The Company also monitors industry loss experience on similar loan portfolio segments. We then identify loans for
individual evaluation under ASC Topic 310. If the individually identified loans are performing, we apply a segment specific loss rate adjusted for relevant environmental factors, if necessary, for those loans reviewed individually and considered
individually impaired, we use one of the three methods for measuring impairment mandated by ASC Topic 310. Generally the fair value of collateral is used since our impaired loans are generally real estate based. In connection with the fair value of
collateral measurement, the Company generally uses an independent appraisal and determines costs to sell. The Company s appraisals for  
      31

commercial income based loans, such as multi-family and commercial real estate loans, assess value based upon the operating cash flows of the business as opposed to merely  as built 
values. The Company then validates the reasonableness of our calculated allowances by: (1) reviewing trends in loan volume, delinquencies, restructurings and concentrations; (2) reviewing prior period (historical) charge-offs and recoveries;
and (3) presenting the results of this process, quarterly, to the Asset Classification Committee and the Savings Bank s Board of Directors. We then tabulate, format and summarize the current loan loss allowance balance for financial and
regulatory reporting purposes.    The Company had no unallocated loss allowance balance at September 30, 2016.  
 The allowance for loan losses represents the amount which management estimates is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in
its loan portfolio. The allowance method is used in providing for loan losses. Accordingly, all loan losses are charged to the allowance, and all recoveries are credited to it. The allowance for loan losses is established through a
provision for loan losses charged to operations. The provision for loan losses is based on management s periodic evaluation of individual loans, economic factors, past loan loss experience, changes in the composition and volume of the
portfolio, and other relevant factors. The estimates used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected on impaired loans, are particularly susceptible to changes in the
near term.    The following tables summarize the primary segments of the allowance for loan losses ( ALLL ), segregated into
the amount required for loans individually evaluated for impairment and the amount required for loans collectively evaluated for impairment as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. Activity in the allowance is presented for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company s ALLL increased by $16
thousand. The $16 thousand increase in the ALLL was primarily attributable to a $34 thousand increase in the ALLL associated with the 1   4 family segment, which was partially offset by decreases in the construction, consumer and
commercial (non-real estate) segments totaling $11 thousand, $5 thousand and $2 thousand respectively. Changes to the ALLL within a particular loan segment during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, were primarily due to changes in associated
loan balances.    During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the ALLL associated with the 1   4 family and construction
loan portfolios increased by $18 thousand and $9 thousand, respectively. The primary reason for the increases in the ALLL associated with these segments were the increases in associated loan balances. The ALLL for consumer loans and
commercial real estate loans decreased $5 thousand and $3 thousand, respectively. The decrease in the ALLL associated with consumer loans was primarily due to lower loan balances within this segment, while the decrease in the ALLL associated
with commercial real estate loans was primarily due to the payoff of one non-performing loan in this segment. The decrease in the ALLL associated with the commercial (non-real estate) loan segment was primarily related to the lower loan balances
within this segment.   During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, the Company also increased its ALLL reserve factors, due to
increases in associated loan balances and qualitative factors throughout fiscal 2016, for the following loan segments:

   FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK (FHLB) ADVANCES        The following table presents
contractual maturities of FHLB long-term advances as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016      
   Maturities of FHLB long-term advances at September 30, 2016, are summarized as follows:  
   
   The terms of the convertible advances reset to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate
( LIBOR ) and have various spreads and call dates of three months. The FHLB has the right to convert from a fixed rate to a predetermined floating rate on its conversion date or quarterly thereafter. Should the advance be
converted, the Company has the right to pay off the advance without penalty. The adjustable rate advances adjust either monthly or quarterly, based on the one-month or three-month LIBOR index, and have various spreads to the LIBOR
index. The spreads to the applicable LIBOR index range from 0.05% to 0.16%. The adjustable rate advances are not convertible or callable. The FHLB advances are secured by the Company s FHLB stock, mortgage-backed and investment
securities, and loans, and are subject to substantial prepayment penalties.

Table of Contents  

  The Company also utilized revolving and short-term FHLB advances. Short-term FHLB
advances generally mature within 90 days, while revolving FHLB advances may be repaid by the Company without penalty. The following table presents information regarding such advances as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016:  
   
   At September 30, 2016, the Company had remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB of approximately $12.8
million.    The FHLB advances are secured by the Company s FHLB stock, loans, and mortgage-backed and investment securities held
in safekeeping at the FHLB. FHLB advances are subject to substantial prepayment penalties.      
   Other borrowings include securities sold under
agreements to repurchase with securities brokers ( repurchase agreements ). These borrowings generally mature within 1 to 90 days from the transaction date and require a collateral pledge. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are
stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. We monitor collateral levels on a continuous basis. We may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Securities
pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with our safekeeping agents.    The following table presents information regarding
other borrowings as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016:

   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS         Fair value is defined as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP established a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation methodologies into the following three levels:      

Level I: 
    
   Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.   

Level II: 
    
   Pricing inputs are other than the quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
reported date. The nature of these assets and liabilities includes items for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently and items that are fair-valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly
observed.   

Level III: 
    
   Assets and liabilities that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These items do not have two-way
markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.   
     Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    
  Investment Securities Available-for-Sale   
 Fair values for securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or
matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other
benchmark quoted securities. The Company has no Level I or Level III investment securities. Level II investment securities were primarily comprised of investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade corporate bonds of
large foreign issuers.    The following tables present the assets reported on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
their fair value as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by GAAP, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis   
 The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market value that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period.  
  Impaired Loans     Loans for which it is
probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance
with ASC Topic 310. The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the
fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. Collateral values are estimated using Level II inputs based on observable market data or Level III inputs based on customized discounting criteria.
For a majority of impaired real estate related loans, the Company obtains a current external appraisal. Other valuation techniques are used as well, including internal valuations, comparable property analysis and contractual sales information. The
Company has no Level I, Level II or Level III impaired loans at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.    The following tables present
the assets reported on a non-recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by GAAP, financial assets and liabilities are
classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

0%/0%  
   When evaluating the value of the collateral on impaired loans, the Company will consider the age of the
most current appraisal, and may discount the appraised value from 1.0% to 15.0%.    The Company classifies financial instruments in
Level III of the fair value hierarchy when there is reliance on at least one significant unobservable input to the valuation model. In addition to these unobservable inputs, the valuation model for Level III financial instruments typically also
rely on a number of inputs that are readily observable, either directly or indirectly.

   Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which generally include
various level III inputs which are not identifiable.

   Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions. The range and weighted
average of appraisal adjustments are presented as a percentage of the appraisals.

   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS        The carrying amounts and estimated
fair values are as follows:      
 
      39  

Table of Contents  

Financial instruments are defined as cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract
which creates an obligation or right to receive or deliver cash or another financial instrument from or to a second entity on potentially favorable or unfavorable terms.  
 Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced or liquidation sale. If a quoted market price is available for a financial instrument, the estimated fair value would be calculated based upon the market price per trading unit of the instrument.  
 If no readily available market exists, the fair value estimates for financial instruments should be based upon management s
judgment regarding current economic conditions, interest rate risk, expected cash flows, future estimated losses, and other factors, as determined through various option pricing formulas or simulation modeling. As many of these assumptions result
from judgments made by management based upon estimates, which are inherently uncertain, the resulting estimated values may not be indicative of the amount realizable in the sale of a particular financial instrument. In addition, changes in the
assumptions on which the estimated values are based may have a significant impact on the resulting estimated values.    As certain
assets and liabilities, such as deferred tax assets, premises and equipment, and many other operational elements of the Company, are not considered financial instruments, but have value, this estimated fair value of financial instruments would not
represent the full market value of the Company.  
      40  

Table of Contents  

  Estimated fair values have been determined by the Company using the best available data, as
generally provided in internal Savings Bank regulatory, or third party valuation reports, using an estimation methodology suitable for each category of financial instruments. The estimation methodologies used are as follows:  
   Cash and Cash Equivalents, Certificates of Deposit, Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable, FHLB Short-term Advances, and Other Short-term Borrowings
     The fair value approximates the current carrying value.  
   Investment Securities, Mortgage-Backed Securities, and FHLB Stock    
 The fair value of investment and mortgage-backed securities is equal to the available quoted market price. If no quoted market price is
available, fair value is estimated using the quoted market price for similar securities. For discussion of valuation of private-label CMOs, see Note 8  Unrealized Losses on Securities . Since the FHLB stock is not actively traded on a
secondary market and held exclusively by member financial institutions, the estimated fair market value approximates the carrying amount.      Net Loans
Receivable, Deposits, and Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance      Fair value for consumer mortgage loans is
estimated using market quotes or discounting contractual cash flows for prepayment estimates. Discount rates were obtained from secondary market sources, adjusted to reflect differences in servicing, credit, and other characteristics.  
 The estimated fair values for consumer, fixed-rate commercial, and multi-family real estate loans are estimated by discounting
contractual cash flows for prepayment estimates. Discount rates are based upon rates generally charged for such loans with similar credit characteristics.  
 The estimated fair value for nonperforming loans is the appraised value of the underlying collateral adjusted for estimated credit risk.
   Demand, savings, money market deposit accounts, and advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance are reported at book
value. The fair value of certificates of deposit is based upon the discounted value of the contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using average market rates for deposits with similar average terms.  
   Bank Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI )    
 The fair value of BOLI approximates the cash surrender value of the policies at these dates.  
   FHLB Long-term Advances      The fair
values of fixed-rate advances are estimated using discounted cash flows, based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying amount on variable rate advances approximates their fair value.  
   Commitments to Extend Credit      These
financial instruments are generally not subject to sale, and estimated fair values are not readily available. The carrying value, represented by the net deferred fee arising from the unrecognized commitment, and the fair value, determined by
discounting the remaining contractual fee over the term of the commitment using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with similar credit risk, is not considered material for disclosure.

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   
  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS     In the normal
course of business, we, in an effort to help keep our shareholders and the public informed about our operations, may from time to time issue or make certain statements, either in writing or orally, that are or contain forward-looking statements, as
that term is defined in the U.S. federal securities laws. Generally, these statements relate to business plans or strategies, projected or anticipated benefits from acquisitions made by or to be made by us, projections involving anticipated
revenues, earnings, profitability or other aspects of operating results or other future developments in our affairs or the industry in which we conduct business. Forward-looking statements may be identified by reference to a future period or
periods or by the use of forward-looking terminology such as  anticipated,   believe,   expect,   intend,   plan,   estimate  or similar expressions.  
 Although we believe that the anticipated results or other expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are based on
reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that those results or expectations will be attained. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions (some of which are beyond our control), and as a result actual results
may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following, as well as those discussed elsewhere
herein:      

our investments in our businesses and in related technology could require additional incremental spending, and might not
produce expected deposit and loan growth and anticipated contributions to our earnings;         

general economic or industry conditions could be less favorable than expected, resulting in a deterioration in credit
quality, a change in the allowance for loan losses or a reduced demand for credit or fee-based products and services;         

changes in the interest rate environment could reduce net interest income and could increase credit losses;

the conditions of the securities markets could change, which could adversely affect, among other things, the value or
credit quality of our assets, the availability and terms of funding necessary to meet our liquidity needs and our ability to originate loans and leases;         

changes in the extensive laws, regulations and policies governing financial holding companies and their subsidiaries
could alter our business environment or affect our operations;         

the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which we are highly dependent,
could present operational issues or require significant capital spending;         

competitive pressures could intensify and affect our profitability, including as a result of continued industry
consolidation, the increased availability of financial services from non-banks, technological developments such as the internet or bank regulatory reform; and     

acts or threats of terrorism and actions taken by the United States or other governments as a result of such acts or
threats, including possible military action, could further adversely affect business and economic conditions in the United States generally and in our principal markets, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance and that of our
borrowers and on the financial markets and the price of our common stock.

  GENERAL     WVS Financial Corp.
(the  Company ) is the parent holding company of West View Savings Bank ( West View  or the  Savings Bank ). The Company was organized in July 1993 as a Pennsylvania-chartered unitary bank holding company and acquired
100% of the common stock of the Savings Bank in November 1993.   West View Savings Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered, FDIC-insured
stock savings bank conducting business from six offices in the North Hills suburbs of Pittsburgh. The Savings Bank converted from the mutual to the stock form of ownership in November 1993. The Savings Bank had no subsidiaries at September 30,
2016.    The operating results of the Company depend primarily upon its net interest income, which is determined by the difference
between income on interest-earning assets, principally loans, mortgage-backed securities and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, which consist primarily of deposits and borrowings. The Company s net
income is also affected by its provision for loan losses, as well as the level of its non-interest income, including loan fees and service charges, and its non-interest expenses, such as compensation and employee benefits, income taxes, deposit
insurance and occupancy costs.     FINANCIAL CONDITION   
 The Company s assets totaled $335.056 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to $335.723 million at June 30, 2016. The
$0.667 million or 0.20% decrease in total assets was primarily comprised of an $8.331 million decrease in investment securities available for sale, a $3.009 million decrease in mortgage-backed securities, and an $0.837 million decrease in investment
securities held to maturity, which were partially offset by a $7.535 million increase in certificates of deposit, a $2.745 million increase in net loans receivable and a $1.328 million increase in total cash and cash equivalents. The decreases in
investment securities available for sale were primarily due to repayments on investment grade fixed rate corporate bonds totaling $18.3 million which were partially offset by purchases of investment grade corporate bonds totaling $10.6 million. The
decrease in mortgage-backed securities was principally attributable to repayments totaling $11.0 million. The increase in certificates of deposit was primarily attributable to purchases of large dollar floating rate certificates of deposit. The
certificates of deposit purchased reprice on a quarterly basis with various margins above the 3-month U.S. LIBOR index. The certificates also qualify for a 20% risk-weight under the Basel III risk-based capital regulations. The increase in net loans
receivable was primarily attributable to increases in the single-family owner occupied segment of the loan portfolio. The increase in total cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to seasonal increases in demand deposits of local real estate tax
collectors. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Asset and Liability Management .    The
Company s total liabilities decreased $0.594 million or 0.20% to $302.044 million as of September 30, 2016 from $302.638 million as of June 30, 2016. The $0.594 million decrease in total liabilities was primarily comprised of a $2.389
million or 1.66% decrease in FHLB short-term advances, which was partially offset by a $1.759 million or 1.25% increase in total deposits. The decrease in FHLB short-term advances was primarily a result of repaying such advances with funds generated
by deposit growth and cash equivalents. The increase in total deposits was primarily attributable to increases in non-interest bearing accounts and money market accounts, totaling $4.909 million and $0.383 million, respectively, which were partially
offset by decreases in certificates of deposit, passbook savings and NOW accounts totaling $1.294 million, $1.125 million and $0.415 million, respectively. Management believes that most of the changes in total savings deposits is attributable
to seasonal local and school real estate tax obligations. See also Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Asset and Liability Management .

  Total stockholders  equity decreased $0.73 million or 0.22% to $33.012 million as of
September 30, 2016, from $33.085 million as of June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to purchases of Treasury Stock totaling $0.359 million, cash dividends paid on the Company s common stock and other comprehensive loss of
$0.031 million which were partially offset by Company net income of $0.398 million. The other comprehensive loss was primarily attributable to a $53 thousand unrealized holding loss (net of tax) on the Company s available for sale
investment portfolio, which was partially offset by a $22 thousand (net of tax) reversal of unrealized holding losses on three private-label CMOs with previously identified OTTI.  
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
  General .     WVS reported net income of $398 thousand or $0.21 earnings per share (basic and diluted)
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Net income increased by $87 thousand or 27.97% and earnings per share (basic and diluted) increased $0.05 or 31.25% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period
in 2015. The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a $78 thousand increase in net interest income, a $9 thousand decrease in non-interest expense, a $6 thousand decrease in income tax
expense and a $3 thousand decrease in the provisions for loan losses, which were partially offset by a $9 thousand decrease in non-interest expense.  
  Net Interest Income .     The Company s net interest income increased by $78 thousand or 5.88% for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in net interest income is attributable to a $140 thousand increase in interest and dividend income, which was partially offset by a $62 thousand
increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to higher average balances of loans outstanding, and higher yields earned on the Company s mortgage-backed and investment securities portfolio, which
were partially offset by lower average balances in the Company s mortgage-backed and investment securities portfolio and lower yields earned on the Company s loan portfolio and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to higher rates paid on FHLB advances and higher average balances of, FHLB advances outstanding during the three months
ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015.    Interest
Income.          Interest income on net loans receivable increased $112 thousand or 21.46% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a $17.383 million increase in the average balance of net loans receivable outstanding, which was partially offset by a decrease of 43 basis points in the weighted average yield earned on
net loans receivable for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the average balance of loans outstanding was primarily attributable to loan originations in excess of repayments,
while the decrease in the average yield earned on net loans receivable was primarily attributable to lower rates on new loans originated. During fiscal 2015, 2016 and into fiscal 2017, the Company enjoyed higher demand for single-family home
purchase loans. Substantially all of our loan originations and purchases were fixed-rate with a mix of 15, 20, and 30 year terms.  
 Interest income on mortgage-backed securities increased $32 thousand or 6.23% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when
compared to the same period in 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a 27 basis point increase in the weighted average yield earned on U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities,
which was partially offset by a $18.2 million decrease in the average balance of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the
average balances of U.S. Government agency and private-label mortgage-backed securities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to principal paydowns of U.S. Government agency and private-label mortgage-backed securities
during the period.   Interest income on certificates of deposit increased $7 thousand or 350.00% for the three months ended September
30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a $2.345 million increase in the average balance of  
      44

certificates of deposit partially offset by a 95 basis point decline in the average yield earned on certificates of deposit. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company
began to purchase large dollar floating rate certificates of deposit to better position itself for a possible increase in market interest rates. The decrease in yield earned during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to
lower variable rate yields earned on new CD purchases when compared to higher fixed rate yields earned during the same period in 2015.  
 Interest income on investment securities increased $2 thousand or 0.39% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when
compared to the same period in 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a 4 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on investment securities, which was partially offset by a
$1.510 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities, when compared to the same period in 2015.   Interest income
on FHLB stock decreased $13 thousand or 14.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in dividends on FHLB stock for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to a 93
basis point decrease in the yield earned on FHLB stock, which was partially offset by a $145 thousand increase in the average balance of FHLB stock held during the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in
2015.    Interest Expense.        Interest paid on FHLB short-term advances increased $174 thousand
or 621.43% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a $106.366 million increase in the average balance of FHLB
short-term advances outstanding, and a 24 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on FHLB short-term advances, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. 
 Interest paid on FHLB long-term advances decreased $109 thousand or 48.44% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared
to the same period in 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a $101.696 million decrease in the average balance of FHLB long-term advances, which was partially offset by a 14 basis
point increase in the yield paid on FHLB long-term variable rate advances for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015.  
 Interest on other short-term borrowings decreased $6 thousand or 100.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to
the same period in 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a $6.317 million decrease in the average balance of other short-term borrowings outstanding for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015.    Interest expense on deposits increased $3 thousand or 5.77% for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in interest expense on deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a 6 basis point increase in the
weighted average rate paid on time deposits and a 2 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on money market accounts, which was partially offset by a $1.659 million decrease in the average balance of time deposits for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015.    Provision for Loan Losses .     A
provision for loan losses is charged to earnings (while credit provision for loan losses are accretive to earnings) to maintain the total allowance at a level considered adequate by management to absorb potential losses in the portfolio.
Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the portfolio considering past experience, current economic conditions, volume, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, and other relevant factors.
   Provisions for loan losses decreased $3 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same
period in 2015. The decrease in the provision for loan losses for the three  
      45  

Table of Contents  

months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily attributable to lower average volumes of loans within the multi-family and commercial loan segments when compared to the same period in
2015. At September 30, 2016, the Company s total allowance for loan losses amounted to $376 thousand or 0.55% of the Company s total loan portfolio, as compared to $360 thousand or 0.55% at June 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016,
the Company s non-performing loans totaled $252 thousand as compared to $254 thousand at June 30, 2016.     Non-Interest
Income .     Non-interest income decreased by $9 thousand or 6.47% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to decreases in service charges on deposits and automated teller machine fee income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Non-Interest Expense .     Non-interest expense decreased $9 thousand or 0.95% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was principally attributable to an $8 thousand decrease in legal expenses associated with past due loans, when
compared to the same period in 2015.    Income Tax Expense.        Income tax expense decreased $6
thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to lower levels of taxable income during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015.    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.191 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Net cash
provided by operating activities was primarily comprised of net income of $398 thousand, a $30 thousand decrease in accrued interest receivable, $597 thousand of amortization of investment premiums, a $13 thousand increase in accrued income taxes,
$24 thousand of depreciation expense, and a $16 thousand increase in the provision for loan losses.   Primary sources of funds during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 included proceeds from investments and mortgage-backed securities in the held-to-maturity portfolio totaling $0.833 million and $11.045 million, respectively, and proceeds from investment securities in the
available-for-sale portfolio totaling $18.280 million. Funds provided by investing activities totaled $1.207 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Primary uses of funds during the three months ended September 30, 2016 included
purchases of investment securities available for sale totaling $10.649 million, purchases of mortgage-backed investment securities held to maturity totaling $7.984 million, purchases of certificates of deposit totaling $7.635 million and an increase
in net loans receivable totaling $2.747 million.   Funds used for financing activities totaled $1.070 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016. The primary uses of cash included a $2.389 repayment of FHLB short-term borrowings, a $1.294 decrease in certificates of deposit, a $699 decrease in borrower tax and insurance escrows, $359 thousand of treasury stock
purchases and $81 thousand of cash dividends paid which was partially offset by a $3.752 million increase in transaction and savings accounts. Management believes that a significant portion of our local maturing deposits will remain with the
Company. Management has determined that it currently is maintaining adequate liquidity and continues to match funding sources with lending and investment opportunities. 
 The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization, repayments and maturities of existing loans, mortgage-backed
securities and investment securities, funds from operations, and funds obtained through FHLB advances and other borrowings. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at September 30, 2016 totaled $22.819 million. 
 Historically, the Company used its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing commitments to pay maturing savings certificates and
savings withdrawals, fund loan commitments and maintain a substantial portfolio of investment securities. At September 30, 2016, total approved loan commitments outstanding were $6.546 million. At the same date, commitments under unused lines
of credit amounted to $5.885 million  
      46

and the unadvanced portion of construction loans approximated $1.755 million. The Company has been able to generate sufficient cash through the retail deposit market, its traditional funding
source, and through FHLB advances, and other borrowings, to provide the cash utilized in investing activities. The Company s available for sale segment of the investment portfolio totaled $99.345 million at September 30, 2016. In
addition, the Company had $7.885 million of certificates of deposit at September 30, 2016. Management believes that the Company currently has adequate liquidity available to respond to liquidity demands.  
 On October 25, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share, payable on
November 17, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 7, 2016. Dividends are subject to determination and declaration by the Board of Directors, which take into account the Company s financial condition,
statutory and regulatory restrictions, general economic conditions and other factors. There can be no assurance that dividends will in fact be paid on the Common Stock in future periods or that, if paid, such dividends will not be reduced or
eliminated.    As of September 30, 2016, WVS Financial Corp. exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and maintained Common Equity
Tier I Capital, Tier I, and total risk-based capital equal to $33.281 million or 18.72%, $33.281 million or 18.72%, and $33.714 million or 18.97%, respectively, of total risk-weighted assets, and Tier I leverage capital of $33.281 million or
9.8% of average quarterly assets.    Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans and real estate owned. A loan is placed on
nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collection of interest is deemed insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but uncollected interest is
deducted from interest income. The Company normally does not accrue interest on loans past due 90 days or more, however, interest may be accrued if management believes that it will collect on the loan.  
 The Company s nonperforming assets at September 30, 2016 totaled $252 thousand or 0.08% of total assets as compared to $254
thousand or 0.08% of total assets at June 30, 2016. Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2016 consisted of one single-family real estate loan totaling $252 thousand. The loan is currently under a bankruptcy order and making payments as
agreed.   The $2 thousand decrease in nonperforming assets during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to
principal repayments on one non-accrual single-family real estate loan.    During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company collected $6 thousand of interest income on non-accrual loans. Approximately $10 thousand of interest income would have been recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016, on non-accrual loans if such loans had been current
according to the original loan agreements for the entire period. These amounts were not included in the Company s interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016.

     ITEM 3.   
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
  ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT   
 The Company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, liquidity risk. All of the
Company s transactions are denominated in US dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure. The Savings Bank has no agricultural loan assets and therefore would not have a specific exposure to changes in commodity prices. Any impacts that
changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates are assumed to be exogenous and will be analyzed on an  ex   post  basis.  
 Interest rate risk ( IRR ) is the exposure of a banking organization s financial condition to adverse movements in
interest rates. Accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value, however excessive levels of IRR can pose a significant threat to the Company s earnings and capital base. Accordingly, effective risk
management that maintains IRR at prudent levels is essential to the Company s safety and soundness.    Evaluating a financial
institution s exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to control IRR and the organization s quantitative level of exposure. When assessing the IRR management process,
the Company seeks to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems and internal controls are in place to maintain IRR at prudent levels with consistency and continuity. Evaluating the quantitative level of IRR
exposure requires the Company to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity, and, where appropriate, asset quality.  
 Financial institutions derive their income primarily from the excess of interest collected over interest paid. The rates of
interest an institution earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Since market interest rates change over time, an institution is exposed to lower profit margins (or losses) if
it cannot adapt to interest-rate changes. For example, assume that an institution s assets carry intermediate- or long-term fixed rates and that those assets were funded with short-term liabilities. If market interest rates rise by
the time the short-term liabilities must be refinanced, the increase in the institution s interest expense on its liabilities may not be sufficiently offset if assets continue to earn at the long-term fixed rates. Accordingly, an
institution s profits could decrease on existing assets because the institution will either have lower net interest income or, possibly, net interest expense. Similar risks exist when assets are subject to contractual interest-rate
ceilings, or rate sensitive assets are funded by longer-term, fixed-rate liabilities in a decreasing-rate environment.    During the
fiscal years 2013-2016 and into fiscal year 2017, intermediate and long-term market interest rates fluctuated considerably. Many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, continued above normal levels of monetary accommodation including
quantitative easing and targeted asset purchase programs. The desired outcomes of these programs are to stimulate aggregate demand, reduce high levels of unemployment and to further lower market interest rates. 
 The effect of interest rate changes on a financial institution s assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the
 interest rate sensitivity  of the assets and liabilities and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity  gap . An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if
it will mature or reprice within a given time period. A gap is considered positive (negative) when the amount of rate sensitive assets (liabilities) exceeds the amount of rate sensitive liabilities (assets). During a period of falling
interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of rising interest rates, a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income.

  As part of its asset/liability management strategy, the Company maintained an asset
sensitive financial position due to unusually low market interest rates. An asset sensitive financial position may benefit earnings during a period of rising interest rates and reduce earnings during a period of declining interest rates.  
 The following table sets forth certain information at the dates indicated relating to the Company s interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities which are estimated to mature or are scheduled to reprice within one year.

  The following table illustrates the Company s estimated stressed cumulative repricing
gap   the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities expected to reprice at a given point in time   at September 30, 2016. The table estimates the impact of an upward or downward change
in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points.     Cumulative Stressed Repricing Gap

   The Company utilizes an income simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to manage interest
rate sensitivity. The Company believes that income simulation modeling may enable the Company to better estimate the possible effects on net interest income due to changing market interest rates. Other key model parameters include:
estimated prepayment rates on the Company s loan, mortgage-backed securities and investment portfolios; savings decay rate assumptions; and the repayment terms and embedded options of the Company s borrowings.

  The following table presents the simulated impact of a 100 and 200 basis point upward or
downward (parallel) shift in market interest rates on net interest income, return on average equity, return on average assets and the market value of portfolio equity at September 30, 2016. This analysis was done assuming that the
interest-earning assets will average approximately $327.259 million and $328.847 million over a projected twelve and twenty-four month period, respectively, for the estimated impact on change in net interest income, return on average equity and
return on average assets. The estimated changes in market value of equity were calculated using balance sheet levels at September 30, 2016. Actual future results could differ materially from our estimates primarily due to unknown future
interest rate changes and the level of prepayments on our investment and loan portfolios and future FDIC regular and special assessments.  
  Analysis of Sensitivity to Changes in Market Interest Rates       
   The table below provides information about the Company s anticipated transactions comprised of firm
loan commitments and other commitments, including undisbursed letters and lines of credit, at September 30, 2016. The Company used no derivative financial instruments to hedge such anticipated transactions as of September 30, 2016.

  In the ordinary course of its construction lending business, the Savings Bank enters into
performance standby letters of credit. Typically, the standby letters of credit are issued on behalf of a builder to a third party to ensure the timely completion of a certain aspect of a construction project or land development. At
September 30, 2016, the Savings Bank had no performance standby letters of credit outstanding. In the event that an obligor is unable to perform its obligations as specified in the applicable letter of credit agreement, the Savings Bank would be
obligated to disburse funds up to the amount specified in the letter of credit agreement. The Savings Bank s policy is to maintain adequate collateral that could be liquidated to fund such contingent obligations.  
    ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
 As of September 30, 2016, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, on the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.
   Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required
to be disclosed by the Company in its reports filed and submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its reports filed under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, no change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) has occurred that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

Exhibit 99       
  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   
 Board of Directors and Stockholders    WVS Financial Corp.  
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of WVS Financial Corp. and subsidiary as of September 30, 2016; the related
consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015; the related consolidated statement of changes in stockholders  equity for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016;
and the related consolidated statement of cash flows for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of WVS Financial Corp. s management.  
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  
 Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements referred
to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.    We have previously audited, in accordance with standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of WVS Financial Corp. as of June 30, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders 
equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated September 15, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
