Graybar Electric Company, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Stated in thousands, except share and per share data) 
  (Unaudited) 

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS 
    
  Graybar Electric Company, Inc. ( Graybar ,  Company , "we", "our", or "us") is a New York corporation, incorporated in 1925.  We are engaged in the distribution of electrical and communications and data networking products and are a provider of related supply chain management and logistics services.  We primarily serve customers in the construction, and commercial, institutional and government ("CIG"), as well as the industrial and utility vertical markets, with products and services that support new construction, infrastructure updates, building renovation, facility maintenance, repair and operations ("MRO"), and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM").  All products sold by us are purchased by us from others, and we neither manufacture nor contract to manufacture any products that we sell.  Our business activity is primarily with customers in the United States ( U.S. ).  We also have subsidiary operations with distribution facilities in Canada and Puerto Rico. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Our accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP ) and are applied on a consistent basis among all years presented.  Significant accounting policies are described below. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Graybar pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ) applicable to interim financial reporting.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that our disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.  Our condensed consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Certain reclassifications were made to prior year amounts to conform to the   2016   presentation.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  In the opinion of management, this quarterly report includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements presented.  Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Graybar and its subsidiary companies.  All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  The ownership interests that are held by owners other than the Company in subsidiaries consolidated by the Company are accounted for and reported as noncontrolling interests. 
    
  Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
    
  Subsequent Events 
    
            We have evaluated subsequent events through the time of the filing of this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   with the Commission.  No material subsequent events have occurred since   September 30, 2016   that require recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.  

8 

Revenue Recognition 
    
  Revenue is recognized when evidence of a customer arrangement exists, prices are fixed and determinable, product title, ownership and risk of loss transfers to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.  Revenues recognized are primarily for product sales, but also include freight and handling charges.  Our standard shipping terms are FOB shipping point, under which product title passes to the customer at the time of shipment.  We also earn revenue for services provided to customers for supply chain management and logistics services.  Service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and completed.  Revenue is reported net of all taxes assessed by governmental authorities as a result of revenue-producing transactions, primarily sales tax. 
    
  Outgoing Freight Expenses                                                                                         
    
  We record certain outgoing freight expenses as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.   
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  We account for cash on hand, deposits in banks, and other short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents. 
    
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
    
  We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, and a significant portion of our trade receivables is secured by mechanic s lien or payment bond rights.  We maintain allowances to reflect the expected uncollectability of trade receivables based on past collection history and specific risks identified in the receivables portfolio.  Although actual credit losses have historically been within management s expectations, additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate. 
    
  Merchandise Inventory 
    
  Our inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) cost method) or market.  LIFO accounting is a method of accounting that, compared with other inventory accounting methods, generally provides better matching of current costs with current sales.   
    
  We make provisions for obsolete or excess inventories as necessary to reflect reductions in inventory value.   
    
  Vendor Allowances 
    
  Our agreements with many of our suppliers provide for us to earn volume incentives based on purchases during the agreement period.  Based on the provisions of our vendor agreements, we develop vendor accrual rates by estimating the point at which we will have completed our performance under the agreement and the deferred amounts will be earned.  We perform analyses and review historical trends to ensure the deferred amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Certain vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. Amounts accrued throughout the year are based on estimates of future activity levels, and could be materially impacted if actual purchase volumes differ.  Changes in the estimated amount of incentives are treated as changes in estimate and are recognized in earnings in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.  In the event that the operating performance of our suppliers were to decline, however, there can be no assurance that amounts earned would be paid or that the volume incentives would continue to be included in future agreements. 
    
  Property and Depreciation 
    
  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is expensed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.  Interest costs incurred to finance expenditures for major long-term construction projects are capitalized as part of the asset's historical cost and included in property, plant and equipment, then depreciated over the useful life of the asset.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred, while the costs of significant improvements, which extend the useful life of the underlying asset, are capitalized.  

9 

Credit Risk 
    
  Financial instruments that potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables.  We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, and a significant portion of our trade receivables may be protected by mechanic s lien or payment bond rights.  We maintain allowances for potential credit losses, and such losses historically have been within management s expectations. 
    
  Fair Value 
    
  We endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.  GAAP has established a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  The tiers in the hierarchy include:  Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own data inputs and assumptions.  We have used fair value measurements to value our pension plan assets. 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate 
    
  The functional currency for our Canadian subsidiary is the Canadian dollar.  Accordingly, its balance sheet amounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period and its statements of income amounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the current period.  Currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Our goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested annually for impairment.  Goodwill is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter and/or when circumstances or other events might indicate that impairment may have occurred.  We first perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment.  The qualitative assessment considers several factors including the excess fair value over carrying value as of the last quantitative impairment test, the length of time since the last fair value measurement, the current carrying value, market conditions, actual performance compared to forecasted performance, and the current business outlook.  If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the reporting unit is then quantitatively tested for impairment.  If a quantitative assessment is required, the fair value is determined using a variety of assumptions including estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit and applicable discount rates.   
    
  Definite Lived Intangible Assets 
    
  The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited.  Customer relationships, trade names and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 20 years.  Intangible assets are tested for impairment if events or circumstances occur indicating that the respective asset might be impaired. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns.  Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still subject to examination and positions expected to be taken in future returns.  A deferred tax asset or liability results from the temporary difference between an item s carrying value as reflected in the financial statements and its tax basis, and is calculated using enacted applicable tax rates.  We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established.  Changes in the valuation allowance, when recorded, are included in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements.  We classify interest expense and penalties as part of our provision for income taxes based upon applicable federal and state interest/underpayment percentages. 
    
  Other Postretirement Benefits 
    
  We account for postretirement benefits other than pensions by accruing the costs of benefits to be provided over the employees  periods of active service.  These costs are determined on an actuarial basis.  Our consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of postretirement benefits. 
  
   10 

Pension Plan 
    
  We sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan accounted for by accruing the cost to provide the benefits over the employees  periods of active service.  These costs are determined on an actuarial basis.  Our consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan. 
    
  New Accounting Standards 
    
  No new accounting standards that were issued or became effective during 2016 have had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements except those noted below: 
    
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU  or  Update ) 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The core principle of Topic 842 requires that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance is required to be adopted at the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact the provisions will have on our consolidated financial statements and whether we will adopt the guidance early. 
    
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-05, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-use Software: Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement".  This Update provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract and expensed as services are received. The Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods.  We adopted this Update on January 1, 2016.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operation, financial position, or cash flows. 
    
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation".  The amendments in this Update affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  We adopted this Update on January 1, 2016.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operation, financial position, or cash flows.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides guidance on a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the Update for one year.  The Update will now be effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.  
    
  The new standard provides for two alternative implementation methods.  The first is to apply the new standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.  This method allows the use of certain practical expedients. The second method is to apply the new standard retrospectively in the year of initial adoption and record a cumulative effect adjustment for the impact of adjusting contracts open at the date of adoption.  Under this transition method, we would apply this guidance retrospectively only to contracts that are not completed contracts at the date of initial application, which for us will be January 1, 2018.  We would then recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. This method also requires us to disclose comparative information for the year of adoption. 
    
  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)".  The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09.  Instead, the amendments in this ASU are intended to further clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue standard issued in ASU 2014-09. 
    
  We continue to determine which method we will use to implement the new standard and to assess the impact the new standard is expected to have on the consolidated financial statements or on other matters or aspects of our business.

3. INCOME TAXES 
    
  We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted applicable tax rates.  We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.  Changes in the valuation allowance, when recorded, are included in the provision for income taxes in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  We classify interest expense and penalties as part of our provision for income taxes based upon applicable federal and state interest/underpayment percentages.  We have accrued   $963   and   $907   in interest and penalties at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Interest was computed on the difference between the provision for income taxes recognized in accordance with GAAP and the amount of benefit previously taken or expected to be taken in our federal, state, and local income tax returns. 
    
  Our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2013 and forward are available for examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ).  The statute of limitations for the 2013 federal return will expire on September 15, 2017, unless extended by consent.  Our state income tax returns for 2011 through 2015 remain subject to examination by various state authorities with the latest period closing on December 31, 2020.  We have not extended the statutes of limitations in any state jurisdictions with respect to years prior to 2011. 
     
  Our unrecognized tax benefits of   $2,387   and   $2,247   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are uncertain tax positions that would impact our effective tax rate if recognized.  We are periodically engaged in tax return examinations, reviews of statute of limitations periods, and settlements surrounding income taxes.  We do not anticipate a material change in unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. 

4. CAPITAL STOCK 
    
  Our common stock is   100%   owned by active and retired employees, and there is no public trading market for our common stock.  Since 1928, substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock have been held of record by voting trustees under successive voting trust agreements.  Under applicable New York law, a voting trust may not have a term greater than ten years.  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   84%   of the common stock was held in a voting trust that expires by its terms on March 15, 2017.  The participation of shareholders in the voting trust is voluntary at the time the voting trust is created, but is irrevocable during its term.  Shareholders who elect not to participate in the voting trust hold their common stock as shareholders of record.   
    
  No holder of our common stock or voting trust interests representing our common stock ("common stock", "common shares", or "shares") may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares without first offering us the option to purchase those shares at the price at which they were issued.  Additionally, a shareholder is entitled to any cash dividends, if any, accrued for the quarter in which the purchase offer is made, adjusted pro rata for the number of days such shares were held prior to the dividend record date.  We also have the option to purchase at the issue price the common shares of any shareholder who ceases to be an employee for any reason other than death or retirement on a pension (except a deferred pension), and on the first anniversary of any holder's death.  In the past, we have always exercised these purchase options, and we expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future.  However, we can make no assurance that we will continue to exercise our purchase option in the future.  All outstanding shares have been issued at   $20.00   per share. 
    
  Cash dividends declared were   $4,985   and   $4,802   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Cash dividends declared were   $14,962   and   $14,418   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we along with Graybar Canada Limited, our Canadian operating subsidiary ( Graybar Canada ), had an unsecured,   five  -year,   $550,000   revolving credit agreement maturing in   June 2019   with Bank of America, N.A. and the other lenders named therein (the "Credit Agreement"), which includes a combined letter of credit sub-facility of up to   $50,000  , a U.S. swing line loan facility of up to   $50,000  , and a Canadian swing line loan facility of up to   $20,000  .  The Credit Agreement includes a   $100,000   sublimit (in U.S. or Canadian dollars) for borrowings by Graybar Canada and contains an accordion feature, which allows us to request increases to the aggregate borrowing commitments of up to   $300,000  .  
  
   12 

The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on us and our subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, changes in the nature of our business, investments, mergers and acquisitions, issuance of equity securities, dispositions of assets and dissolution of certain subsidiaries, transactions with affiliates, restricted payments (subject to incurrence tests, with certain exceptions), as well as securitizations, factoring transactions, and transactions with sanctioned parties or in violation of certain U.S. or Canadian anti-corruption laws.  There are also maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio financial covenants that we are subject to during the term of the Credit Agreement.  We were in compliance with all these covenants as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  We had total letters of credit of   $5,460   and   $4,994   outstanding, of which   none   were issued under the Credit Agreement at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The letters of credit are issued primarily to support certain workers' compensation insurance policies. 
      
  There were   $273,849   and   $104,978   in short-term borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Short-term borrowings outstanding during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   ranged from a minimum of   $105,014   and   $35,981   to a maximum of   $311,506   and   $184,188  , respectively. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had unused lines of credit under the Credit Agreement amounting to   $276,151   available, compared to   $445,022   at   December 31, 2015  .  These lines are available to meet our short-term cash requirements and are subject to annual fees of up to   40   basis points (  0.40%  ). 
    
  Private Placement Shelf Agreements 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had an uncommitted   $100,000   private placement Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. (the "Prudential Shelf Agreement").  The Prudential Shelf Agreement allows us to issue senior promissory notes to affiliates of Prudential at fixed rate terms to be agreed upon at the time of any issuance during a three year issuance period ending in September 2017.    No   notes had been issued under the Prudential Shelf Agreement as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  On September 22, 2016, we entered into an uncommitted   $100,000   private placement shelf agreement (the  MetLife Shelf Agreement ) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and MetLife Investment Advisors, LLC  and each other affiliate of MetLife that becomes a party to the agreement (collectively,  MetLife ).  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, the MetLife Shelf Agreement is expected to allow the Company to issue senior promissory notes to MetLife at fixed or floating rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of any issuance during a three-year issuance period ending in September 2019.  Floating rate note interest rates will be based on London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a spread.  No notes have been issued under the MetLife Shelf Agreement, which ranks equally with the Company s Credit Agreement and Prudential Shelf Agreement.   
    
  Each shelf agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the Company and the investor.  Each shelf agreement also contains customary events of default, including: a failure to pay principal, interest or fees when due; a failure to comply with covenants; the fact that any representation or warranty made by any of the credit parties is incorrect when given; the occurrence of an event of default under certain other indebtedness of Graybar and its subsidiaries; the commencement of certain insolvency or receivership events affecting any of the credit parties; certain actions under ERISA; and the occurrence of a change in control of Graybar (subject to certain permitted transactions as described in our Credit Agreement and in the applicable shelf agreement).  Upon the occurrence of an event of default, all outstanding obligations of Graybar under any or all of these agreements may be declared immediately due and payable. 
    
  Each shelf agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of this type, including limitations on Graybar and its subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, changes in the nature of its business, investments, mergers and acquisitions, issuance of equity securities, dispositions of assets and dissolution of certain subsidiaries, transactions with affiliates, restricted payments (subject to incurrence tests, with certain exceptions), as well as securitizations, factoring transactions, and transactions with sanctioned parties or in violation of certain U.S. or Canadian anti-terrorism laws.  There are also maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio financial covenants to which we are subject during the term of the shelf agreement.  These covenants are substantially similar to those contained in the Credit Agreement, subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the applicable shelf agreement.  We were in compliance with all covenants as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  
   13 

In addition, we have agreed to a most favored lender clause which is designed to ensure that any notes issued in the future under the Prudential Shelf Agreement and MetLife Shelf Agreement will continue to be of equal ranking with our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement. 

6. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 
    
  We have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees first hired prior to July 1, 2015 after the completion of one year of service and 1,000 hours of service.  The plan provides retirement benefits based on an employee s average earnings and years of service.  These employees become 100% vested after   three   years of service, regardless of age.  A supplemental benefit plan provides nonqualified benefits for compensation in excess of the IRS compensation limits applicable to the plan.  
    
  Our plan funding policy is to make contributions, provided that the total annual contributions will not be less than ERISA and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 minimums or greater than the maximum tax-deductible amount, to review the contribution and funding strategy on a regular basis, and to allow discretionary contributions to be made by us from time to time.  The assets of the defined benefit pension plan are invested primarily in fixed income investments and equity securities.  We pay nonqualified pension benefits when they are due according to the terms of the supplemental benefit plan.   
    
  We provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees.  Substantially all of our employees hired or rehired prior to 2014 may become eligible for postretirement medical benefits if they reach the age and service requirements of the retiree medical plan and retire on a service pension (except a deferred pension) under the defined benefit pension plan.  Medical benefits are self-insured and claims are administered through an insurance company.  The cost of coverage is determined based on the annual projected plan costs.  The participant's premium or cost is determined based on Company guidelines.  Postretirement life insurance benefits are insured through an insurance company.  We fund postretirement benefits as incurred, and accordingly, there were no assets held in the postretirement benefits plan at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The net periodic benefit cost for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   included the following components:  

We made qualified and nonqualified pension contributions totaling   $44,002   and   $10,002   during the   three  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Contributions made during the   nine  -month periods ending   September 30,  
  
   14 

2016   and   2015   totaled   $81,633   and   $31,536  , respectively.  Additional contributions totaling   $2   are expected to be paid during the remainder of   2016  .

The following table represents the activity included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

8. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE 
    
  We consider properties to be assets held for sale when all of the following criteria are met: (i) a formal commitment to a plan to sell a property has been made and exercised; (ii) the property is available for sale in its present condition; (iii) actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated; (iv) sale of the property is probable and we expect the sale will occur within one year; and (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value. 
    
  Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and depreciation of the property ceases.  The net book value of assets held for sale was   $58   at   December 31, 2015  .  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we sold   no   assets classified as held for sale and recorded   no   net gains on the assets held for sale.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold an asset classified as held for sale with a net book value of   $58   and recorded a net gain on the asset held for sale of   $1,627   in other income, net.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold assets classified as held for sale with a net book values of   $4,669   and recorded a net gains on the assets held for sale of   $4,195   in other income, net.  The remaining net book value of assets still held for sale at   September 30, 2016   is   $553   and is recorded in net property in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  We review long-lived assets held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. For assets classified as held and used, impairment may occur if projected  
  
   16 

undiscounted cash flows are not adequate to cover the carrying value of the assets. In such cases, additional analysis is conducted to determine the amount of the loss to be recognized. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its estimated fair value. The analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and, where applicable, selection of an appropriate discount rate. Such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed necessary.  
    
  For assets held for sale, impairment occurs whenever the net book value of the property listed for sale exceeds the expected selling price less estimated selling expenses.  There were   no   impairment charges recorded during the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Graybar and our subsidiaries are subject to various claims, disputes, and administrative and legal matters incidental to our past and current business activities.  As a result, contingencies may arise resulting from an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible loss. 
    
  We account for loss contingencies in accordance with GAAP.  Estimated loss contingencies are accrued only if the loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  With respect to a particular loss contingency, it may be probable that a loss has occurred but the estimate of the loss is a wide range.  If we deem an amount within the range to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount will be accrued.  However, if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.  While we believe that none of these claims, disputes, administrative, and legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, these matters are uncertain and we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact, if any, of these matters will be material to our results of operations in the period during which such matters are resolved or a better estimate becomes available. 

10. ACQUISITIONS 
    
  In April 2015, we acquired   100%   of the outstanding capital stock of Advantage Industrial Automation, Inc. ( Advantage ), which provides control and automation solutions to industrial users, OEMs and system integrators, for   $18,093   in cash, net of cash acquired.  The purchase price allocation resulted in approximately   $7,057   and   $8,283   of tax deductible goodwill and other intangible assets, respectively.  
    
  On July 1, 2016, we purchased Cape Electrical Supply ("Cape Electric"), a regional distributor serving electrical contractors and large engineering construction firms, as well as industrial, institutional and utility customers, for approximately   $59,946   in cash, net of cash acquired.  The purchase price allocation is preliminary pending finalization of the valuation of the long lived assets including acquired intangible assets, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in approximately   $16,544   and   $23,586   of tax deductible goodwill and other intangible assets, respectively.   
    
  Since the date of acquisition, Advantage and Cape Electric results are reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Pro forma results of these acquisitions are not material; therefore, they are not presented.

Background 
    
  Graybar Electric Company, Inc. ( Graybar ,  Company , "we", "our", or "us") is a New York corporation, incorporated in 1925.  We are engaged in the distribution of electrical and communications and data networking products and are a provider of related supply chain management and logistics services.  We primarily serve customers in the construction, and commercial, institutional and government ("CIG"), as well as the industrial and utility vertical markets, with products and services that support new construction, infrastructure updates, building renovation, facility maintenance, repair and operations ("MRO"), and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs").  All products sold by us are purchased by us from others, and we neither manufacture nor contract to manufacture any products we sell.  Our business activity is primarily with customers in the United States ("U.S.").  We also have subsidiary operations with distribution facilities in Canada and Puerto Rico. 
    
  Our common stock is 100% owned by active and retired employees, and there is no public trading market for our common stock.  No holder of our common stock or voting trust interests representing our common stock ( common stock ,  common shares , or  shares ) may sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any shares without first offering us the option to purchase those shares at the price at which they were issued.  Additionally, a shareholder is entitled to any cash dividends, if any, accrued for the quarter in which the purchase offer is made, adjusted pro rata for the number of days such shares were held prior to the dividend record date.  We also have the option to purchase at the issue price the common shares of any shareholder who ceases to be an employee for any reason other than death or retirement on a pension (except a deferred pension), and on the first anniversary of any holder's death.  In the past, we have always exercised these purchase options, and we expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future.  However, we can make no assurance that we will continue to exercise our purchase option in the future.  All outstanding shares have been issued at $20.00 per share.

Business Overview   
    
  Net sales for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1,689,619  , a record quarter for net sales for the second consecutive quarter.  This was   $105,733  , or   6.7%   higher than the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Year-to-date   September 30, 2016   net sales totaled   $4,785,620  , an increase of   $237,948  , or   5.2%  , over year-to-date   September 30, 2015   net sales of   $4,547,672  .  Quarter-to-date net sales in our construction and CIG vertical markets increased   11.3%   and   2.7%  , respectively, while our industrial and utility vertical market net sales decreased   1.6%  .  Year-to-date net sales in our construction vertical market increased   9.8%  , while our industrial and utility vertical market net sales decreased   1.2%   and our CIG vertical market net sales decreased   0.1%  . 
    
  The gross margin rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   18.9%   and   19.1%  , resepctively.  Gross margin increased   $15,800  , or   5.2%  , to   $318,758   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to gross margin of   $302,958   for the same period last year.  Year-to-date   September 30, 2016   and   2015   gross margin rate was   18.9%   and   18.8%  , respectively.  Year-to-date   September 30, 2016   gross margin increased   $48,675  , or   5.7%  , to   $904,004  , compared to gross margin of   $855,329   for the same   nine  -month period last year.  Our year-to-date improved gross margin rate continues to be the result of our organic gross margin improvement and product diversification initiatives. 
    
  Net income attributable to the Company for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $1,818  , or   6.4%  , to   $30,129   from   $28,311   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , while net income attributable to the Company for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $4,950  , or   7.5%  , to   $70,809   from   $65,859   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Our performance for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was the result, in part, of our sustained focus on achieving profitable growth and strengthening our position in the supply chain.  Over the last several years, we have invested in new and expanded facilities, training and developing our people, and enhancing our technology and service capabilities.  
    
  While we will continue to remain focused on organic growth, we will pursue new opportunities to drive our long-term success and expand our reach by looking at new locations and exploring potential acquisitions. 

Consolidated Results of Operations 
    
  The following tables set forth certain information relating to our operations stated in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

19 

Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Net sales totaled   $1,689,619   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1,583,886   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $105,733  , or   6.7%  .  Net sales in our construction and CIG vertical markets increased for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same   three  -month period of   2015   by   11.3%   and   2.7%  , respectively, while net sales in our industrial and utility vertical market declined by   1.6%  .  
    
  Gross margin   increased     $15,800  , or   5.2%  , to   $318,758   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $302,958   for the same period of   2015   primarily due to increased net sales in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  .  Our gross margin as a percent of net sales totaled   18.9%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   19.1%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in gross margin rate was primarily due to a change in sales mix for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same   three   month period in   2015  . 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A")   increased     $10,297  , or   4.2%  , to   $254,969   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $244,672   in the   third   quarter of   2015  , due primarily to an increase in employee benefit costs, normal compensation increases and increases in management and sales incentive accruals for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled   15.1%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   15.4%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expenses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $1,323  , or   12.1%  , to   $12,283   from   $10,960   in the   third   quarter of   2015  , due to an increase in property, at cost.  Total property, at cost, at   September 30, 2016   was   $934,625  , an increase of   $29,555  , or   3.3%  , when compared to total property, at cost, at   September 30, 2015   of   $905,070  .  Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled   0.7%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Other income, net totaled   $629   for the   three  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1,187   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Other income, net consists primarily of gains on the disposal of property, trade receivable interest charges to customers, and other miscellaneous income items related to our business activities.  The   decrease   in other income, net was primarily due to lower net gains on the disposal of personal property for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same   three  -month period in   2015  . 
    
  Interest expense, net increased   $530  , or   77.4%  , to   $1,215   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $685   for the same period of   2015  .  The increase was primarily due to higher levels of average outstanding short-term borrowings. 
    
  Income before provision for income taxes totaled   $50,920   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $3,092  , or   6.5%  , from   $47,828   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to our growth in gross margin partially offset by increases in SG A and depreciation and amortization expenses.  

20 

Our total provision for income taxes   increased     $1,293  , or   6.7%  , to   $20,724   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $19,431   for the same period of   2015  .  Our effective tax rate was   40.7%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   40.6%   for the same period of   2015  .  The   increase   in the effective tax rate was largely attributable to an increase in state and foreign taxes.  The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was higher than the 35.0% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes. 
    
  Net income attributable to Graybar Electric Company, Inc. for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $1,818  , or   6.4%  , to   $30,129   from   $28,311   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Net sales totaled   $4,785,620   for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4,547,672   for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   $237,948  , or   5.2%  .  Net sales in our construction vertical market increased by   9.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same   nine  -month period of   2015  , while net sales in our industrial and utility and CIG vertical markets declined by   1.2%   and   0.1%  , respectively. 
    
  Gross margin   increased     $48,675  , or   5.7%  , to   $904,004   from   $855,329   primarily due to our focus on gross margin rate improvement initiatives, as well as increased net sales in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  .  Our gross margin as a percent of net sales totaled   18.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , up from   18.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased     $32,618  , or   4.5%  , to   $750,266  , for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $717,648   for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2015  , due primarily to an increase in employee benefit costs, normal compensation increases and increases in management and sales incentive accruals for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to   15.7%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   15.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $3,076  , or   9.6%  , to   $35,158   from   $32,082   for the same   nine  -month period in   2015  , due to an increase in property, at cost.  Total property, at cost, at   September 30, 2016   was   $934,625  , an increase of   $29,555  , or   3.3%  , when compared to total property, at cost, at   September 30, 2015   of   $905,070  .  Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of net sales remained constant at   0.7%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Other income, net totaled   $3,438   for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6,746   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Other income, net consists primarily of gains on the disposal of property, trade receivable interest charges to customers, and other miscellaneous income items related to our business activities.  The   decrease   in other income, net was primarily due to reduced net gains on the disposal of real and personal property for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same   nine  -month period in   2015  . 
    
  Interest expense, net increased   $740  , or   39.1%  , to   $2,635   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,895   for the same period of   2015  .  The increase was primarily due to higher levels of average outstanding short-term borrowings. 
    
  Income before provision for income taxes totaled   $119,383   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $8,933  , or   8.1%  , from   $110,450   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to our growth in gross margin and partially offset by increases in SG A and depreciation and amortization expenses.  
    
  Our total provision for income taxes   increased     $3,982  , or   9.0%  , to   $48,396   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $44,414   for the same period in   2015  .  Our year-to-date effective tax rate was   40.5%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   40.2%   for the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   in the effective tax rate was attributable to discrete events and an increase in state and foreign taxes as compared to the prior year.  The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was higher than the 35.0% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes. 
    
  Net income attributable to Graybar Electric Company, Inc. for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $4,950  , or   7.5%  , to   $70,809   from   $65,859   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Financial Condition and Liquidity 
    
  We manage our liquidity and capital levels so that we have the capacity to invest in the growth of our business, meet debt service obligations, finance anticipated capital expenditures, pay dividends, make benefit payments, finance information technology needs, fund acquisitions and finance other miscellaneous cash outlays.  We believe that maintaining a strong company financial condition enables us to competitively access multiple financing channels, maintain an optimal cost of capital and enable our company to invest in strategic long-term growth plans. 
    
  We have historically funded our working capital requirements using cash flows generated by the collection of trade receivables and trade accounts payable terms with our suppliers, supplemented by short-term bank lines of credit.  Capital expenditures have been financed primarily by cash from working capital management, short-term bank lines of credit and long-term debt. 
    
  Our cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   were   $51,111  , compared to   $37,931   at   December 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $13,180  , or   34.7%  .  Our short-term borrowings increased significantly,   $168,871  , or   160.9%   during the   nine  -month period to   $273,849   at   September 30, 2016   from   $104,978   at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the financing of strategic investments in merchandise inventory to support the growth of sales and our acquisition of Cape Electric in the third quarter, all funded via short-term lines of credit.  In addition, cash collections, as measured by days sales outstanding, declined modestly for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  Finally, current assets exceeded current liabilities by   $447,960   at   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $2,517  , or   0.6%  , from   $445,443   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Cash used by operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $59,338  , compared to cash provided by operations of   $21,098   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Cash flows used by operations for   September 30, 2016   was attributable to increased inventory levels during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $83,059   to support our continued growth of sales during   2016  , as well as an increase in trade receivables of   $73,623   as a result of increased sales and a modest increase in days sales outstanding for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and a decrease in accrued payroll benefits of   $21,835   and a decrease of   $51,832   in other non-current liabilities as a result of additional voluntary pension contributions made during the second and third quarters of 2016.  These uses were partially offset by net income of   $70,987   and an increase in trade accounts payable of   $16,571  .  
    
  Merchandise inventory turnover declined moderately for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , as a result of increased merchandise inventory levels, partially offset by higher sales volume at   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  .  The average number of days of sales in trade receivables for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   increased moderately compared to the same   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used by investing activities totaled   $81,465   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $69,001   for the same   nine  -month period in   2015  , an increase of   $12,464  , or   18.1%  .  The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Cape Electric, net of cash, for   $59,946  , partially offset by lower capital expenditures in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  In the first quarter of   2015  , we purchased a new regional distribution center in southern California for $23,392.  In the second quarter of   2016  , we acquired two properties for a total of $3,279.  Proceeds on the disposal of property decreased during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2015  .  In the first quarter of   2016   we disposed of a local distribution facility that provided proceeds of $1,686, compared to first quarter of   2015   when we disposed of a regional distribution center in northern California that provided proceeds of $8,214.  Both facilities had been classified as an asset held for sale.    
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $153,983  , compared to   $56,460   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $97,523  , or   172.7%  .  The increase was primarily due to the increase in our short term borrowings for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , to fund our operating and investing activities. 

22 

Liquidity 
    
  We had a $550,000 revolving credit facility with   $276,151   in available capacity at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $445,022   at   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we also had an uncommitted $100,000 private placement shelf agreement that allows us to issue senior promissory notes to affiliates of Prudential at fixed rate terms to be agreed upon at the time of any issuance during a three year issuance period ending in September 2017.  At September 30, 2016, we also had an uncommitted $100,000 private placement shelf agreement that allows us to issue senior promissory notes to affiliates of MetLife at fixed rate terms to be agreed upon at the time of any issuance during a three year issuance period ending in September 2019.  We have not issued any notes under the shelf agreements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   For further discussion related to our revolving credit facility and our private placement shelf agreements, refer to Note 5, "Debt", of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements located in Item 1. 
    
  We had total letters of credit of $  5,460   and   $4,994   outstanding, of which   none   were issued under the   $550,000   revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The letters of credit are issued primarily to support certain workers' compensation insurance policies.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use Of Proceeds. 
    
  Our common stock is 100% owned by active and retired employees, and there is no public trading market for our common stock.  Since 1928, substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock have been held of record by voting trustees under successive voting trust agreements.  Under applicable New York law, a voting trust may not have a term greater than ten years.  The 2007 Voting Trust Agreement expires by its terms on March 15, 2017.  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   84%   of the common stock was held in this voting trust.  The participation of shareholders in the voting trust is voluntary at the time the voting trust is created, but is irrevocable during its term.  Shareholders who elect not to participate in the voting trust hold their common stock as shareholders of record. 
    
  No holder of our common stock or voting trust interests representing our common stock ("common stock", "common shares", or "shares") may sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any shares without first offering us the option to purchase those shares at the price at which they were issued.  Additionally, a shareholder is entitled to any cash dividends, if any, accrued for the quarter in which the purchase offer is made, adjusted pro rata for the number of days such shares were held prior to the dividend record date.  We also have the option to purchase at the issue price the common shares of any shareholder who ceases to be an employee for any cause other than death or retirement on a pension (except a deferred pension), and on the first anniversary of any holder's death.  In the past, we have always exercised these purchase options, and we expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future.  However, we can make no assurance that we will continue to exercise our purchase option in the future.  All outstanding shares have been issued at $20.00 per share. 
    
  The following table sets forth information regarding purchases of common stock by the Company, all of which were made  pursuant to the foregoing provisions:

GRAYBAR ELECTRIC COMPANY 
  $100,000,000 PRIVATE SHELF AGREEMENT 
    
  September 22, 2016 
  To Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and 
  MetLife Investment Advisors, LLC (together,    MetLife   ) 
  To each other MetLife Party which becomes bound by this Agreement as hereinafter provided (each, a    Purchaser    and collectively,  the    Purchasers   ): 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  Graybar Electric Company, Inc., a New York corporation (the    Company   ), agrees with MetLife and each of the Purchasers as follows: 
           SECTION 1. 
    AUTHORIZATION OF NOTES. 
     The Company will authorize the issue of senior promissory notes (the    Shelf Notes,    such term to include any such notes issued in substitution thereof pursuant to Section 13) in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100,000,000, each to be dated the date of issue thereof, to mature, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 12 years after the date of original issuance thereof (provided that floating rate Notes shall have a maturity no later than 10 years after the date of original issuance thereof), to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 12 years after the date of original issuance thereof (provided that floating rate Notes shall have an average life of no more than 10 years after the date of original issuance thereof), to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the fixed or floating rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in the Confirmation of Acceptance with respect to such Shelf Note delivered pursuant to Section 2(f), and in the case of fixed rate Shelf Notes, to be substantially in the form of Schedule 1-A attached hereto, and in the case of floating rate Shelf Notes, to be substantially in the form of Schedule 1-B attached hereto.  The terms    Note    and    Notes    as used herein shall include each Shelf Note delivered pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and each Note delivered in substitution or exchange for any such Note pursuant to any such provision.  Notes which have (i) the same final maturity, (ii) the same principal prepayment dates, (iii) the same principal prepayment amounts (as a percentage of the original principal amount of each Note), (iv) the same interest rate, (v) the same interest payment periods and (vi) the same date of issuance (which, in the case of a Note issued in exchange for another Note, shall be deemed for these purposes the date on which such Note s  

ultimate predecessor Note was issued), are herein called a    Series    of Notes.    Certain capitalized and other terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule A  .    References to a  Schedule  are references to a Schedule attached to this Agreement unless otherwise specified  .    References to a  Section  are references to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. 
           SECTION 2. 
    SALE AND PURCHASE OF NOTES. 
     (a)      Facility  .  MetLife is willing to consider, in its sole discretion and within limits which may be authorized for purchase by MetLife Parties from time to time, the purchase of Shelf Notes pursuant to this Agreement.  The willingness of MetLife to consider such purchase of Shelf Notes is herein called the    Facility.     At any time, subject to the additional limitations in Section 2(b), the aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes stated in Section 1, minus the aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes purchased and sold pursuant to this Agreement prior to such time, minus the aggregate principal amount of Accepted Notes (as hereinafter defined) which have not yet been purchased and sold hereunder prior to such time, is herein called the    Available Facility Amount    at such time.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE WILLINGNESS OF METLIFE TO CONSIDER PURCHASES OF SHELF NOTES BY METLIFE PARTIES, THIS AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO ON THE EXPRESS UNDERSTANDING THAT NEITHER METLIFE NOR ANY METLIFE PARTY SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE OR ACCEPT OFFERS TO PURCHASE SHELF NOTES, OR TO QUOTE RATES, SPREADS OR OTHER TERMS WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC PURCHASES OF SHELF NOTES, AND THE FACILITY SHALL IN NO WAY BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY METLIFE OR ANY METLIFE PARTY. 
  (b)      Issuance Period  .  Shelf Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the date of this Agreement (or if such anniversary date is not a Business Day, the Business Day next preceding such anniversary) and (ii) the thirtieth day after MetLife shall have given to the Company, or the Company shall have given to MetLife, a written notice stating that it elects to terminate the issuance and sale of Shelf Notes pursuant to this Agreement (or if such thirtieth day is not a Business Day, the Business Day next preceding such thirtieth day).  The period during which Shelf Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to this Agreement is herein called the    Issuance Period.  
  (c)      Periodic Spread Information  .  Provided no Default or Event of Default exists, not later than 9:30 A.M. (New York City local time) on a Business Day during the Issuance Period if there is an Available Facility Amount on such Business Day, the Company may request by e mail, telecopier or telephone, and MetLife will, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide to the Company on such Business Day (or, if such request is received after 9:30 A.M. (New York City local time) on such Business Day, on the following Business Day), information (by e mail, telecopier or telephone) with respect to various spreads at which MetLife Parties might be interested in  
  
   -2- 

purchasing Notes of different average lives;   provided, however,   that the Company may not make such requests more frequently than once in every five Business Days or such other period as shall be mutually agreed to by the Company and MetLife.  The amount and content of information so provided shall be in the sole discretion of MetLife but it is the intent of MetLife to provide information which will be of use to the Company in determining whether to initiate procedures for use of the Facility.  Information so provided shall not constitute an offer to purchase Notes, and neither MetLife nor any MetLife Party shall be obligated to purchase Notes at the spreads specified.  Information so provided shall be representative of potential interest only for the period commencing on the day such information is provided and ending on the earlier of the fifth Business Day after such day and the first day after such day on which further spread information is provided.  MetLife may suspend or terminate providing information pursuant to this Section 2(c) for any reason, including its determination that the credit quality of the Company has declined since the date of this Agreement. 
  (d)      Request for Purchase  .  The Company may from time to time during the Issuance Period make requests for purchases of Shelf Notes (each such request being a    Request for Purchase   ).  Each Request for Purchase shall be made to MetLife by e mail, telecopier or overnight delivery service, and shall (i) specify the aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes covered thereby, which shall not be less than $5,000,000 and not be greater than the Available Facility Amount at the time such Request for Purchase is made, (ii) specify whether the interest rate will be fixed or floating and, in the case of a floating interest rate, specify whether the length of the Interest Period is one, three or six months, (iii) specify the principal amounts, final maturities, principal prepayment dates and amounts, interest payment dates and interest payment periods (quarterly or semi annually in arrears) of the Shelf Notes covered thereby, (iv) specify the use of proceeds of such Shelf Notes, (v) specify the proposed day for the closing of the purchase and sale of such Shelf Notes, which shall be a Business Day during the Issuance Period not less than 10 days and not more than 25 days after the making of such Request for Purchase, (vi) specify the number of the account and the name and address of the depository institution to which the purchase prices of such Shelf Notes are to be transferred on the Closing for such purchase and sale, (vii) certify that the representations and warranties contained in Section 5 are true on and as of the date of such Request for Purchase and that there exists on the date of such Request for Purchase no Event of Default or Default, and (viii) be substantially in the form of Schedule 2(d) attached hereto.  Each Request for Purchase shall be in writing signed by the Company and shall be deemed made when received by MetLife. 
  (e)      Rate Quotes  .  Not later than five Business Days after the Company shall have given MetLife a Request for Purchase pursuant to Section 2(d), MetLife may, but shall be under no obligation to, provide to the Company by telephone, email or telecopier, in each case between 9:30 A.M. and 1:30 P.M. New York City local time (or such later time as MetLife may elect) interest rate quotes for the several principal amounts, maturities, principal prepayment schedules, interest payment periods (quarterly or semi annually in arrears) of Shelf Notes specified in such Request  
  
   -3- 

for Purchase and the Acceptance Window for such quote.  Each quote (i) relating to a Shelf Note bearing a fixed interest rate, shall represent the interest rate per annum payable on the outstanding principal balance of such Shelf Note at which MetLife or a MetLife Party would be willing to purchase such Shelf Note at 100% of the principal amount thereof and (ii) relating to a Shelf Note bearing a floating interest rate, shall include the LIBOR Rate Note Margin at which MetLife or a MetLife Party would be willing to purchase such Shelf Note at 100% of the principal amount thereof and any Applicable Premium in the case of any early prepayment of such Shelf Note. 
  (f)      Acceptance  .  Within the Acceptance Window with respect to any interest rate quotes provided pursuant to Section 2(e), the Company may, subject to Section 2(g), elect to accept such interest rate quotes as to not less than $5,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Shelf Notes specified in the related Request for Purchase.  Such election shall be made by an Authorized Officer of the Company notifying MetLife by e mail, telephone or telecopier within the Acceptance Window that the Company elects to accept such interest rate quotes, specifying the Shelf Notes (each such Shelf Note being an    Accepted Note   ) as to which such acceptance (an    Acceptance   ) relates.  The day the Company notifies MetLife of an Acceptance with respect to any Accepted Notes is herein called the    Acceptance Day    for such Accepted Notes.  Any interest rate quotes as to which MetLife does not receive an Acceptance within the Acceptance Window shall expire, and no purchase or sale of Shelf Notes hereunder shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes.  Subject to Section 2(g) and the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company agrees to sell to a MetLife Party, and MetLife agrees to purchase and/or cause the purchase by a MetLife Party of, the Accepted Notes at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes.  As soon as practicable following the Acceptance Day, the Company, MetLife and each MetLife Party which is to purchase any such Accepted Notes will execute a confirmation of such Acceptance substantially in the form of Schedule 2(f) attached hereto (a    Confirmation of Acceptance   ).  If the Accepted Note bears a floating interest rate, then the LIBOR Rate Note Margin specified in the Confirmation of Acceptance shall remain constant for the life of such Note.  If the Company should fail to execute and return to MetLife within three Business Days following the Company s receipt thereof a Confirmation of Acceptance with respect to any Accepted Notes, MetLife may at its election at any time prior to MetLife s receipt thereof cancel the closing with respect to such Accepted Notes by so notifying the Company in writing. 
  (g)      Market Disruption  .  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2(f), if MetLife shall have provided interest rate quotes pursuant to Section 2(e) and thereafter prior to the time an Acceptance with respect to such quotes shall have been notified to MetLife in accordance with Section 2(f):  (i) in the case of any fixed rate Shelf Notes, the domestic market for U.S. Treasury securities or derivatives shall have closed or there shall have occurred a general suspension, material limitation, or significant disruption of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or in the domestic market for U.S. Treasury securities or derivatives, or (ii) in the case  
  
   -4- 

of any floating rate Shelf Notes, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for the relevant Interest Period, or MetLife reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent demonstrable error) that LIBOR does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to MetLife for funding the floating rate Shelf Notes, then such interest rate quotes shall expire, and no purchase or sale of Shelf Notes hereunder shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes.  If the Company thereafter notifies MetLife of the Acceptance of any such interest rate quotes, such Acceptance shall be ineffective for all purposes of this Agreement, and MetLife shall promptly notify the Company that the provisions of this Section 2(g) are applicable with respect to such Acceptance. 
  (h)      Fees  . 
  (i)      Issuance Fee  .  The Company will pay to each Purchaser in immediately available funds a fee (the    Issuance Fee   ) on each Closing Day in an amount equal to 0.10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes sold to such Purchaser on such Closing Day;   provided, however,   that if the initial Closing Day occurs within 90 days of the date of this Agreement, then no Issuance Fee shall be due to the Purchaser in connection with such Closing Day. 
  (ii)      Delayed Delivery Fee  .  If the closing of the purchase and sale of any Accepted Note is delayed for any reason beyond the original Closing Day for such Accepted Note, the Company will pay to each Purchaser which shall have agreed to purchase such Accepted Note on the Cancellation Date or actual closing date of such purchase and sale a fee (the    Delayed Delivery Fee   ) calculated as follows: 
  (A)    in the case of an Accepted Note bearing a fixed interest rate, (BEY - MMY) X DTS/360 X PA where    BEY    means Bond Equivalent Yield, i.e., the bond equivalent yield per annum of such Accepted Note;    MMY    means Money Market Yield, i.e., the yield per annum on a commercial paper investment of the highest quality selected by MetLife on the date MetLife receives notice of the delay in the closing for such Accepted Note having a maturity date or dates the same as, or closest to, the Rescheduled Closing Day or Rescheduled Closing Days for such Accepted Note (a new alternative investment being selected by MetLife each time such closing is delayed);    DTS    means Days to Settlement, i.e., the number of actual days elapsed from and including the original Closing Day with respect to such Accepted Note (in the case of the first such payment with respect to such Accepted Note) or from and including the date of the next preceding payment (in the case of any subsequent delayed delivery fee payment with respect to such Accepted Note) to but excluding  
  
   -5- 

the date of such payment; and    PA    means Principal Amount, i.e., the principal amount of the Accepted Note for which such calculation is being made.   
  (B)    in the case of an Accepted Note bearing a floating interest rate, the sum of (x) the amount equal to the product of (1) the difference between the Adjusted   LIBOR   Rate for the relevant Interest Period and the Overnight Interest Rate on funds deposited on each day from and including the original Closing Day for such Accepted Note, (2) the principal amount of such Accepted Note and (3) a fraction the numerator of which is equal to the number of actual days elapsed from and including the original Closing Day for such Accepted Note to but excluding the date of such payment hereunder, and the denominator of which is 360 and (y) the out of pocket documented costs and expenses (if any) reasonably incurred by such Purchaser or its affiliates with respect to any interest rate agreement or transaction entered into by such Purchaser or any such affiliates in connection with the delayed closing of such Accepted Notes. 
  In no case shall the Delayed Delivery Fee be less than zero.  Nothing contained herein shall obligate any Purchaser to purchase any Accepted Note on any day other than the Closing Day for such Accepted Note, as the same may be rescheduled from time to time in compliance with Section 3.2. 
  (iii)      Cancellation Fee  .  If the Company at any time notifies MetLife in writing that the Company is canceling the closing of the purchase and sale of any Accepted Note, or if MetLife notifies the Company in writing under the circumstances set forth in the last sentence of Section 2(f) or the penultimate sentence of Section 3.2 that the closing of the purchase and sale of such Accepted Note is to be canceled, or if the closing of the purchase and sale of such Accepted Note is not consummated on or prior to the last day of the Issuance Period (the date of any such notification, or the last day of the Issuance Period, as the case may be, being the    Cancellation Date   ), the Company will pay to each Purchaser which shall have agreed to purchase such Accepted Note no later than one day after the Cancellation Date in immediately available funds an amount (the    Cancellation Fee   ) calculated as follows: 
  PI X PA 
  (A)    in the case of an Accepted Note bearing a fixed interest rate, where    PI    means Price Increase, i.e., the quotient (expressed in decimals) obtained by dividing (a) the excess of the ask price (as determined by MetLife) of the Hedge Treasury Note(s) on the Cancellation Date over the bid price (as determined by  
  
   -6- 

MetLife) of the Hedge Treasury Notes(s) on the Acceptance Day for such Accepted Note by (b) such bid price; and    PA    has the meaning in Section 2(h)(ii).  The foregoing bid and ask prices shall be as reported by TradeWeb LLC (or, if such data for any reason ceases to be available through TradeWeb LLC, any publicly available source of similar market data).  Each price shall be based on a U.S. Treasury security having a par value of $100.00 and shall be rounded to the second decimal place.   
  (B)    in the case of an Accepted Note bearing a floating interest rate, the aggregate of all unwinding costs incurred by such Purchaser or its affiliates on positions executed by or on behalf of such Purchaser or such affiliates in connection with the proposed lending and setting the LIBOR Rate Note Margin,   provided, however,   that any gain realized upon the unwinding of any such positions shall be offset against any such unwinding costs.  Such positions include (without limitation) interest rate swaps, futures and forwards, all of which may be subject to substantial price volatility.  All unwinding costs incurred by such Purchaser shall be determined by MetLife or its affiliate in accordance with generally accepted financial practice. 
  In no case shall the Cancellation Fee be less than zero. 
  (i)      Determination and Notification of Floating Interest Rates  .  Two (2) Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period with respect to a Shelf Note that bears a floating interest rate, the Company shall determine the Adjusted   LIBOR   Rate (based on the LIBOR Rate Note Margin determined by MetLife pursuant to any Confirmation of Acceptance with respect to such Shelf Note), and will give notice to MetLife and the holders of such Shelf Note, together with a copy of the appropriate Bloomberg Financial Markets Newscreen or other display as specified in the definition of  LIBOR , specifying the LIBOR Rate as so determined.  In the event that MetLife does not concur with such determination by the Company as evidenced by notice to such Issuer by MetLife within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by MetLife of the notice delivered by the Company pursuant to the previous sentence, the determination of Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall be made by MetLife and shall be conclusive and binding absent demonstrable error.  The Interest Period specified in the relevant Confirmation of Acceptance for a Note bearing a floating interest rate shall remain constant during the life of such Note. 
           SECTION 3. 
    CLOSING.     
       Section 3.1.    Facility Closings  .  Not later than 11:30 A.M.

Each Shelf Closing is referred to as a  Closing.  
    Section 3.2.    Rescheduled Facility Closings  .  If the Company fails to tender to any Purchaser the Accepted Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser on the scheduled Closing Day for such Accepted Notes as provided above in Section 3.1, or any of the conditions specified in Section 4 shall not have been fulfilled by the time required on such scheduled Closing Day, the Company shall, prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled Closing Day notify MetLife (which notification shall be deemed received by each Purchaser) in writing whether (a) such closing is to be rescheduled (such rescheduled date to be a Business Day during the Issuance Period not less than one Business Day and not more than 10 Business Days after such scheduled Closing Day (the    Rescheduled Closing Day   )) and certify to MetLife (which certification shall be for the benefit of each Purchaser) that the Company reasonably believes that it will be able to comply with the conditions set forth in Section 4 on such Rescheduled Closing Day and that the Company will pay the Delayed Delivery Fee in accordance with Section 2(h)(ii) or (b) such closing is to be canceled.  In the event that the Company shall fail to give such notice referred to in the preceding sentence, MetLife (on behalf of each Purchaser) may at its election, at any time after 1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled Closing Day, notify the Company in writing that such closing is to be canceled.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary appearing in this Agreement, the Company may not elect to reschedule a closing with respect to any given Accepted Notes on more than one occasion, unless MetLife shall have otherwise consented in writing.

    Section 5.1.    Organization; Power and Authority  .  The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

   -12- 

it transacts and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Notes and to perform the provisions hereof and thereof. 
    Section 5.2.    Authorization, Etc  .  This Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery thereof each Note will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Documents, since the end of the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements have been furnished, there has been no change in the financial condition, operations, business or properties of the Company or any Subsidiary except changes that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  To the actual knowledge of the Responsible Officers, there is no fact known to the Company that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been set forth herein or in the Disclosure Documents.  For the purposes of this Section 5.3, the Disclosure Documents shall be deemed to include all filings made with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company pursuant to sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the Company shall be deemed to have made delivery of any such Disclosure Document if it shall have timely made such Disclosure Document available on the Securities and Exchange Commission s Electronic Data Gathering Analysis, and Retrieval system, or its successor thereto (   EDGAR   ).

  (c)    Each Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and, where applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Each such Subsidiary has the corporate or other entity power and authority to own or hold under lease the material properties it purports to own or hold under lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact.

           SECTION 8. 
    PAYMENT AND PREPAYMENT OF THE NOTES    . 
     Section 8.1.    Required Prepayments.    Each Series of Shelf Notes shall be subject to required prepayments, if any, set forth in the Notes of such Series,   provided   that upon any partial prepayment of the Shelf Notes of any Series pursuant to Section 8.2, the principal amount of each required prepayment of the Shelf Notes of such Series becoming due under this Section 8.1 on and after the date of such prepayment shall be reduced in the same proportion as the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Shelf Notes of such Series is reduced as a result of such prepayment. 
  As provided therein, the entire unpaid principal balance of each Note shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date thereof. 
  Section 8.2.    Optional Prepayments with Make-Whole Amount        .   
  (a)      Floating Rate Notes.    The Company may, at its option, upon notice as provided below, prepay at any time all, or from time to time any part of, any Series of Notes bearing a floating interest rate, in an amount not less than $1,000,000 (and integral multiples of $100,000) at 100% of the principal amount so prepaid,   provided   that the Company concurrently pays the Applicable Premium, if any, and any LIBOR Breakage Amount determined for the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount.  The Company will give each holder of the Series of Notes to be prepaid written notice of each optional prepayment under this Section 8.2(a) not less than 10 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment.  Each such notice shall specify such date (which shall be a Business Day), the aggregate principal amount of the Series of Notes to be prepaid on such date (determined in accordance with Section 8.3), the principal amount of each Note held by such holder to be prepaid (determined in accordance with Section 8.4), and the interest, Applicable Premium, if any, and any LIBOR Breakage Amount to be paid on the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid. 
  (b)      Fixed Rate Notes  .

   -30- 

with respect to such principal amount.  The Company will give each holder of the Series of Notes to be prepaid written notice of each optional prepayment under this Section 8.2 not less than 10 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment unless the Company and the Required Holders agree to another time period pursuant to Section 17.  Each such notice shall specify such date (which shall be a Business Day), the aggregate principal amount of the Series of Notes to be prepaid on such date, the principal amount of each Note held by such holder to be prepaid (determined in accordance with Section 8.3), and the interest to be paid on the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such prepayment (calculated as if the date of such notice were the date of the prepayment), setting forth the details of such computation.  Two Business Days prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of the Series of Notes to be prepaid a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified prepayment date. 
  Section 8.3.    Allocation of Partial Prepayments.    In the case of any partial prepayment of the Notes of any Series, pursuant to any required prepayments, if any, set forth in the Notes of such Series or Section 8.2, the principal amount of the Notes of such Series to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes of such Series at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment. 
  Section 8.4.    Maturity; Surrender, Etc.    In the case of each optional prepayment of Notes of any Series pursuant to this Section 8, the principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such prepayment (which shall be a Business Day), together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, Applicable Premium and LIBOR Breakage Amount, if any.  From and after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and Make-Whole Amount, Applicable Premium and LIBOR Breakage Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall cease to accrue.  Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note. 
  Section 8.5.    Purchase of Notes.    The Company will not and will not permit any Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes of any Series except upon the payment or prepayment of the Notes of such Series in accordance with this Agreement and the Notes of such Series.  The Company will promptly cancel all Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment or prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Agreement and no Notes may be issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes. 
  
   -31- 

Section 8.6.    Make-Whole Amount. 
   Make-Whole Amount    means, with respect to any Note bearing a fixed interest rate, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called Principal,   provided   that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero.  For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings: 
   Called Principal    means, with respect to any Note, the principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires. 
   Discounted Value    means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal. 
   Reinvestment Yield    means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by the yield(s) reported as of 10:00 a.m.(New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as  Page PX1  (or such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities (   Reported   ) having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date.  If there are no such U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between the yields Reported for the applicable most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities with the maturities (1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life.  The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note.  If such yields are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), then    Reinvestment Yield    means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average  
  
   -32- 

Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date.  If there is no such U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life.  The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note. 
   Remaining Average Life    means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years, computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months and calculated to two decimal places, that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment. 
   Remaining Scheduled Payments    means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date,   provided   that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.4 or Section 12.1. 
   Settlement Date    means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires. 
  Section 8.7.    Payment Due on Non-Business Days.    Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, (x) subject to clause (y), any payment of interest on any Note that is due on a date that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day; and (y) any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount on any Note (including principal due on the Maturity Date of such Note) that is due on a date that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and shall include the additional days elapsed in the computation of interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day. 
           SECTION 9.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Credit Parties may dissolve Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the terms of Section 10.5(a)(v) and (vi). 
  Section 9.3.    Maintenance of Property; Insurance.    (a) Keep all material property useful and necessary in its business in good working order and condition (ordinary wear and tear, damage by casualty and obsolescence excepted); and

    Section 9.5.    Compliance with Law.    Comply, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply, with all laws, rules, regulations and orders, and all applicable restrictions imposed by all Governmental Authorities (including, without limitation, environmental laws, ERISA, the USA PATRIOT Act and the other laws and regulations that are referred to in Section 5.16), applicable to them and their respective properties if noncompliance with any such law, rule, regulation, order or restriction would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 
  Section 9.6.    Subsidiary Guarantors  .      (a) The Company will cause any and all of its direct and indirect Material Domestic Subsidiaries, whether newly formed, after acquired or otherwise existing, to promptly become a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder by way of execution of a Subsidiary Guaranty or Guarantor Supplement, as applicable.  Furthermore, within 30 days after a Domestic Subsidiary becomes a Material Domestic Subsidiary, as determined by the financial statements delivered to MetLife, the Purchasers and/or holders of the Notes pursuant to Section 7.1(a) and/or (b), the Company will cause such Domestic Subsidiary to become a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder by way of execution of a Subsidiary Guaranty or a Guarantor Supplement, as applicable.  In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall deliver to MetLife (only during the Issuance Period), to the Purchasers (after the acceptance of any request for purchase of Notes but before the issuance of such Notes) and holders of the Notes (after Notes have been issued) such Organization Documents, officer s certificates and opinions of in-house counsel as MetLife, the Purchasers and/or holders of the Notes, as applicable, may reasonably request;   provided   that, upon reasonable request of MetLife, the Purchasers and/or holders of the Notes, as applicable, the Company shall deliver opinions of outside counsel with respect to such Subsidiary Guarantors. 
  (b)    If at any time any Subsidiary that is not required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder provides a guarantee or otherwise becomes liable at any time, whether as a borrower or additional or co-borrower or otherwise of, the Company s obligations under any Material Credit Facility or any other senior Indebtedness in excess of $25,000,000, the Company will then promptly cause such Subsidiary (other than Graybar Canada) to become a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder by way of execution of a Subsidiary Guaranty or a Guarantor Supplement, as applicable; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any guaranty created, issued, incurred or assumed by a Foreign Subsidiary in respect of Indebtedness incurred by any other Subsidiary so long as such Foreign Subsidiary that creates, incurs or assumes such guaranty has not also created, issued, incurred or assumed a guaranty in respect of Indebtedness incurred by the Company or any Domestic Subsidiary pursuant to the Material Credit Facility.

Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement.  On reasonable request by the Company in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying this Section 20. 
  In the event that as a condition to receiving access to information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, MetLife or any Purchaser or holder of a Note is required to agree to a confidentiality undertaking (whether through IntraLinks, another secure website, a secure virtual workspace or otherwise) which is different from this Section 20, this Section 20 shall not be amended thereby and, as between MetLife or such Purchaser or such holder and the Company, this Section 20 shall supersede any such other confidentiality undertaking.

Upon receipt of such notice, any reference to such Purchaser in this Agreement  
  
   -55- 

(other than in this Section 21), shall be deemed to refer to such Substitute Purchaser in lieu of such original Purchaser.  In the event that such Substitute Purchaser is so substituted as a Purchaser hereunder and such Substitute Purchaser thereafter transfers to such original Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such Substitute Purchaser, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer, any reference to such Substitute Purchaser as a  Purchaser  in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Substitute Purchaser, but shall refer to such original Purchaser, and such original Purchaser shall again have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.

This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the State of New York excluding choice of law principles of the law of such State that would permit the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State.

Process shall be deemed given only when actually received. 
  (c)    Nothing in this Section 22.7 shall affect the right of any holder of a Note to serve process in any manner permitted by law, or limit any right that the holders of any of the Notes may have to bring proceedings against the Company in the courts of any appropriate jurisdiction or to enforce in any lawful manner a judgment obtained in one jurisdiction in any other jurisdiction.

FORM OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT 
  THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT, dated as of ____, ____ (this    Guaranty Agreement   ), is made by each of the undersigned (each a    Guarantor    and, together with each of the other signatories hereto and any other entities from time to time parties hereto pursuant to Section 13.1 hereof, the    Guarantors   ) in favor of the Purchasers (as defined below) and the other holders from time to time of the Notes (as defined below).  The Purchasers and such other holders are herein collectively called the    holders    and individually a    holder.  
  PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS: 
  I.    Graybar Electric Company, Inc., a New York corporation (the    Company   ), is entering into a Private Shelf Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2016 (as amended, modified, supplemented or restated from time to time, the    Shelf Agreement   ), with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, MetLife Investment Advisors, LLC and each other MetLife Party which becomes bound by the Shelf Agreement as provided therein (each, a    Purchaser    and collectively, the    Purchasers   ).  Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings specified in the Shelf Agreement unless otherwise defined herein. 
  II.    Pursuant to the Shelf Agreement, the Company proposes to issue and sell $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior note obligations (the    Shelf Notes   ).  Any Shelf Notes that may from time to time be issued pursuant to the Shelf Agreement (including any notes issued in substitution for any of the Notes) are herein collectively called the    Notes    and individually a    Note.  
  III.    It is a condition to the agreement of the Purchasers to purchase certain Notes that this Guaranty Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by each Guarantor and shall be in full force and effect. 
  IV.    Each Guarantor will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Shelf Agreement.  The board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof), general partner or board of managers, as applicable, of each Guarantor has determined that the incurrence of such obligations is in the best interests of such Guarantor. 
  NOW THEREFORE, in order to induce, and in consideration of, the execution and delivery of the Shelf Agreement and the purchase of the Notes by each of the Purchasers, each Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees with, and represents and warrants to each of the holders as follows: 
           SECTION 1. 
    GUARANTY. 

Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and jointly and severally with the other Guarantors guarantees to each holder, the due and punctual payment in full of (a) the principal of, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest on (including, without limitation, interest accruing after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy, or the commencement of any insolvency, reorganization or like proceeding, whether or not a claim for post-filing or post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding), and any other amounts due under, the Notes when and as the same shall become due and payable (whether at stated maturity or by required or optional prepayment or by acceleration or otherwise) and (b) any other sums which may become due under the terms and provisions of the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein, (all such obligations described in clauses (a) and (b) above are herein called the    Guaranteed Obligations   ).  The guaranty in the preceding sentence is an absolute, present and continuing guaranty of payment and not of collectability and is in no way conditional or contingent upon any attempt to collect from the Company or any other guarantor of the Notes (including, without limitation, any other Guarantor hereunder) or upon any other action, occurrence or circumstance whatsoever.  In the event that the Company shall fail so to pay any of such Guaranteed Obligations, each Guarantor agrees to pay the same when due to the holders entitled thereto, without demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind, in lawful money of the United States of America, pursuant to the requirements for payment specified in the Notes and the Shelf Agreement.  Each default in payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall give rise to a separate cause of action hereunder and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action arises.  Each Guarantor agrees that the Notes issued in connection with the Shelf Agreement may (but need not) make reference to this Guaranty Agreement. 
  Each Guarantor agrees to pay and to indemnify and save each holder harmless from and against any damage, loss, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys  fees) which such holder may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (x) any breach by such Guarantor, by any other Guarantor or by the Company of any warranty, covenant, term or condition in, or the occurrence of any default under, this Guaranty Agreement, the Notes, or the Guaranteed Obligations, together with all expenses resulting from the compromise or defense of any claims or liabilities arising as a result of any such breach or default, (y) any legal action commenced to challenge the validity or enforceability of this Guaranty Agreement, the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein and (z) enforcing or defending (or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) the provisions of this Guaranty Agreement. 
  Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that such Guarantor s liability hereunder is joint and several with the other Guarantors and any other Person(s) who may guarantee the obligations and Indebtedness under and in respect of the Notes and the Shelf Agreement. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions or any other provision of this Guaranty Agreement, the Purchasers (on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns) and each  
  
   -2- 

Guarantor hereby agree that if at any time the Guaranteed Obligations exceed the Maximum Guaranteed Amount determined as of such time with regard to such Guarantor, then this Guaranty Agreement shall be automatically amended to reduce the Guaranteed Obligations to the Maximum Guaranteed Amount.  Such amendment shall not require the written consent of any Guarantor or any holder and shall be deemed to have been automatically consented to by each Guarantor and each holder.  Each Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time exceed the Maximum Guaranteed Amount without affecting or impairing the obligation of such Guarantor.     Maximum Guaranteed Amount    means as of the date of determination with respect to a Guarantor, the lesser of (a) the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations outstanding on such date and (b) the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor s liability under this Guaranty Agreement subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (or any successor provision) or any comparable provision of applicable state law. 
           SECTION 2. 
    OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. 
     The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be primary, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein, shall not be subject to any counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense (except payment which is not subsequently avoided or recovered) based upon any claim such Guarantor may have against the Company or any holder or otherwise, and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or in any way affected by, any circumstance or condition whatsoever (whether or not such Guarantor shall have any knowledge or notice thereof), including, without limitation: (a) any amendment to, modification of, supplement to or restatement of the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein (it being agreed that the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall apply to the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any such other instrument as so amended, modified, supplemented or restated) or any assignment or transfer of any thereof or of any interest therein, or any furnishing, acceptance or release of any security for the Notes or the addition, substitution or release of any other Guarantor or any other entity or other Person primarily or secondarily liable in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations; (b) any waiver, consent, extension, indulgence or other action or inaction under or in respect of the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein; (c) any bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, reorganization, readjustment, composition, liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to the Company or its property; (d) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor or of the Company into or with any other Person or any sale, lease or transfer of any or all of the assets of any Guarantor or of the Company to any Person; (e) any failure on the part of the Company for any reason to comply with or perform any of the terms of any other agreement with any Guarantor; (f) any failure on the part of any holder to obtain, maintain, register or otherwise perfect any security (it being understood that the Guaranteed Obligations are unsecured obligations of the Company as of the date hereof); or (g) any other event or circumstance  
  
   -3- 

which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor (whether or not similar to the foregoing), and in any event however material or prejudicial it may be to any Guarantor or to any subrogation, contribution or reimbursement rights any Guarantor may otherwise have.  Each Guarantor covenants that its obligations hereunder will not be discharged except by indefeasible payment in full in cash of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other obligations hereunder. 
           SECTION 3. 
    WAIVER. 
     Each Guarantor unconditionally waives to the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) notice of acceptance hereof, of any action taken or omitted in reliance hereon and of any default by the Company in the payment of any amounts due under the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein, and of any of the matters referred to in Section 2 hereof, (b) all notices which may be required by statute, rule of law or otherwise to preserve any of the rights of any holder against such Guarantor, including, without limitation, presentment to or demand for payment from the Company or any Guarantor with respect to any Note, notice to the Company or to any Guarantor of default or protest for nonpayment or dishonor and the filing of claims with a court in the event of the bankruptcy of the Company, (c) any right to require any holder to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy including, without limitation, any right, power or remedy conferred in the Shelf Agreement or the Notes, (d) any requirement for diligence on the part of any holder and (e) any other act or omission or thing or delay in doing any other act or thing which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor or in any manner lessen the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder. 
           SECTION 4.  
    OBLIGATIONS UNIMPAIRED. 
     Each Guarantor authorizes the holders, without notice or demand to such Guarantor or any other Guarantor and without affecting its obligations hereunder, from time to time: (a) to renew, compromise, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, all or any part of the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein; (b) to change any of the representations, covenants, events of default or any other terms or conditions of or pertaining to the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein, including, without limitation, decreases or increases in amounts of principal, rates of interest, the Make-Whole Amount, Applicable Premium, LIBOR Breakage Amount or any other obligation; (c) to take and hold security for the payment of the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein, for the performance of this Guaranty Agreement or otherwise for the Indebtedness guaranteed hereby and to exchange, enforce, waive, subordinate and release any such security; (d) to apply any such security and to direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the holders in their sole discretion may determine; (e) to obtain additional or substitute endorsers or guarantors or release any other  
  
   -4- 

Guarantor or any other Person or entity primarily or secondarily liable in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations; (f) to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company, any Guarantor or any other Person; and (g) to apply any sums, by whomsoever paid or however realized, to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other obligations owed hereunder.  The holders shall have no obligation to proceed against any additional or substitute endorsers or guarantors or to pursue or exhaust any security provided by the Company, such Guarantor or any other Guarantor or any other Person or to pursue any other remedy available to the holders. 
  If an event permitting the acceleration of the maturity of the principal amount of any Notes shall exist and such acceleration shall at such time be prevented or the right of any holder to receive any payment on account of the Guaranteed Obligations shall at such time be delayed or otherwise affected by reason of the pendency against the Company, any Guarantor or any other guarantors of a case or proceeding under a bankruptcy or insolvency law, such Guarantor agrees that, for purposes of this Guaranty Agreement and its obligations hereunder, the maturity of such principal amount shall be deemed to have been accelerated with the same effect as if the holder thereof had accelerated the same in accordance with the terms of the Shelf Agreement, and such Guarantor shall forthwith pay such accelerated Guaranteed Obligations. 
           SECTION 5. 
    SUBROGATION AND SUBORDINATION. 
     (a)    Each Guarantor will not exercise any rights which it may have acquired by way of subrogation under this Guaranty Agreement, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, or accept any payment on account of such subrogation rights, or any rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity or any rights or recourse to any security for the Notes or this Guaranty Agreement unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. 
  (b)    Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all Indebtedness and other obligations of the Company or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations owing to such Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including, without limitation, all rights and claims described in clause (a) of this Section 5, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all of the Guaranteed Obligations.  If the Required Holders so request, any such Indebtedness or other obligations shall be enforced and performance received by such Guarantor as trustee for the holders and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the holders promptly, in the form received (together with any necessary endorsements) to be applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, as may be directed by the Required Holders, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of any Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement. 
  
   -5- 

(c)    If any amount or other payment is made to or accepted by any Guarantor in violation of any of the preceding clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 5, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the holders and shall be paid over to the holders promptly, in the form received (together with any necessary endorsements) to be applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, as may be directed by the Required Holders, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement. 
  (d)    Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Shelf Agreement and that its agreements set forth in this Guaranty Agreement (including this Section 5) are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. 
  (e)    Each Guarantor hereby agrees that, to the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid an amount hereunder to any holder that is greater than the net value of the benefits received, directly or indirectly, by such paying Guarantor as a result of the issuance and sale of the Notes (such net value, its    Proportionate Share   ), such paying Guarantor shall, subject to Section 5(a) and 5(b), be entitled to contribution from any Guarantor that has not paid its Proportionate Share of the Guaranteed Obligations.  Any amount payable as a contribution under this Section 5(e) shall be determined as of the date on which the related payment is made by such Guarantor seeking contribution and each Guarantor acknowledges that the right to contribution hereunder shall constitute an asset of such Guarantor to which such contribution is owed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 5(e) shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the holders of the Notes hereunder or under the Notes, the Shelf Agreement or any other document, instrument or agreement executed in connection therewith, and each Guarantor shall remain jointly and severally liable for the full payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. 
           SECTION 6. 
    REINSTATEMENT OF GUARANTY. 
     This Guaranty Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if and to the extent at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the sums due to any holder on account of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by a holder upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or any other guarantors, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect to the Company or any other guarantors or any part of its or their property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. 
           SECTION 7. 
    RANK OF GUARANTY. 
     
   -6- 

Each Guarantor will ensure that its payment obligations under this Guaranty Agreement will at all times rank at least   pari passu,   without preference or priority, with all other unsecured and unsubordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing. 
           SECTION 8. 
    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF EACH GUARANTOR. 
     Each Guarantor represents and warrants to each holder as follows: 
    Section 8.1.    Organization; Power and Authority  .  Such Guarantor is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Such Guarantor has the corporate limited liability company or limited partnership power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this Guaranty Agreement and to perform the provisions hereof.

    AMENDMENT AND WAIVER. 
       Section 11.1.    Requirements  .  Except as otherwise provided in the fourth paragraph of Section 1 of this Guaranty Agreement, this Guaranty Agreement may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of each Guarantor and the Required Holders, except that no amendment or waiver (a) of any of the first three paragraphs of Section 1 or any of the provisions of Section 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, or 11 hereof, or any defined term (as it is used therein), or (b) which results in the limitation of the liability of any Guarantor hereunder (except to the extent provided in the fourth paragraph of Section 1 of this Guaranty Agreement) will be effective as to any holder unless consented to by such holder in writing. 
    Section 11.2.    Solicitation of Holders of Notes      . 
  (a)      Solicitation  .  Each Guarantor will provide each holder of the Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof.  Each Guarantor will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 11.2 to each holder promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes. 
  (b)      Payment  .  The Guarantors will not directly or indirectly pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security or provide other credit support, to any holder as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently granted or other credit support concurrently provided, on the same terms, ratably to each holder even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment. 
    Section 11.3.    Binding Effect  .  Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 11 applies equally to all holders and is binding upon them and upon each future holder and upon each Guarantor without regard to whether any Note has been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver.

   -9- 

No course of dealing between a Guarantor and the holder nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder.  As used herein, the term  this Guaranty Agreement  and references thereto shall mean this Guaranty Agreement as it may be amended, modified, supplemented or restated from time to time. 
    Section 11.4.    Notes Held by Company, Etc  .

   All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing and sent (a) by telecopy if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), or (b) by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested (postage prepaid), or (c) by a recognized overnight delivery service (with charges prepaid).  Any such notice must be sent: 
  (a)    if to any Guarantor, to the address of the Company specified in the Shelf Agreement, or such other address as such Guarantor shall have specified to the holders in writing, or  
  (b)    if to any holder, to such holder at the address specified for such communications set forth in Schedule A to the Shelf Agreement (in the case of the Shelf Notes) or as specified by such Purchaser in its Confirmation of Acceptance (in the case of Shelf Notes), or such other address as such holder shall have specified to the Guarantors in writing. 
  Notice under this Section 12 will be deemed given only when actually received.

    MISCELLANEOUS. 
       Section 13.1.    Successors and Assigns; Joinder  .

    Section 13.2.    Severability  .

    Section 13.3.    Construction  .

This Guaranty Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the State of [New York], excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that would permit the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State.

(a) Each Guarantor irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty Agreement.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, any objection that it may now  
  
   -11- 

or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 
  (b)    Each Guarantor consents to process being served by or on behalf of any holder in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in Section 13.6(a) by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to it at its address specified in Section 12 or at such other address of which such holder shall then have been notified pursuant to Section 12.  Each Guarantor agrees that such service upon receipt (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (ii) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it.  Notices hereunder shall be conclusively presumed received as evidenced by a delivery receipt furnished by the United States Postal Service or any reputable commercial delivery service.

  (d)    THE GUARANTORS AND THE HOLDERS HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT ON OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.

Each Guarantor agrees and stipulates that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by such holder in the regular course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence.  This Section 13.7 shall not prohibit any Guarantor or any other holder of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.

    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3) 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4) 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5) 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
