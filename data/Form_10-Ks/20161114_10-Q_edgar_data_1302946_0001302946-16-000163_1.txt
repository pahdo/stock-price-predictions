  TWO RIVERS WATER   FARMING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  
  (Unaudited)  
   
  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS  
  Unless the context requires otherwise, references in these notes to  Two Rivers,  the  Company,   we,   our,   us  and similar terms are to Two Rivers Water   Farming Company and its subsidiaries.  
  Corporate Evolution   
   
 In 2014, we formed a new company, TR Capital Partners, LLC or TR Capital, which issued all of its common units to Two Rivers Water   Farming Company, and our direct and indirect subsidiaries entered into a series of related transactions as the result of which assets and operations of those subsidiaries transferred to TR Capital.  As a result of those transactions, TR Capital operates or controls all of the operations formerly conducted by those subsidiaries, and we classify TR Capital as Two Rivers Water   Farming Company for purposes of our financial statements.  Two Rivers has divided its operations into our traditional lines of business of farming and water, which are operated by us, and our cannabis-focused business, which is operated by our subsidiary GrowCo, Inc., or GrowCo. 
   
    Overview  
   
 In 2009, we began acquiring and developing irrigated farmland and associated water rights and infrastructure.  As of September 30, 2016, we owned 7,350 gross acres.   
   
 In May 2014 we formed GrowCo, which issued 20,000,000 shares of its common stock to Two Rivers.  In August 2014 we announced that we were reserving 10,000,000 of the GrowCo shares for distribution to holders of our Common Stock as of four record dates (January 1, 2015; April 1, 2015; July 1, 2015 and October 1, 2015) after a registration statement covering GrowCo common shares has been filed and declared effective, which has not yet occurred.  On each record date, we recorded a pending distribution of 2,500,000 GrowCo common shares on a pro rata basis to holders of Common Stock. 
   
 Under GrowCo, a separate Colorado limited liability company will own each greenhouse or extraction facility.  On January 20, 2015, GrowCo Partners 1, LLC, or GCP1, completed a $4.4 million financing for the first greenhouse project, which consists of a 90,000 square foot greenhouse and 15,000 square foot processing and warehouse facility on 40 acres of land.  GCP1 s greenhouse was partially occupied in September with lease revenue beginning September 1, 2015.  On April 14, 2016, we received notice from the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Colorado Department of Revenue that the then current tenant, Suncanna, LLC ( Suncanna ), had received a suspension order.  This suspension, in addition to non-payment of back due lease payments owed, caused Suncanna to be in violation of its lease with GCP1.  Therefore, GCP1 began the eviction process against Suncanna.  Due to the eviction process, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, we wrote off $743,000 in Lease Revenues   Related Party, wrote off $587,000 in advances to Suncanna, and did not recognize any Lease Revenues   Related Party.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $25,000 in greenhouse lease revenue from a payment received from Suncanna in early April 2016.  The total write off of $1.330 million was partially offset by a $350,000 reduction in the amount owed to the GCP1 preferred unit holders.  On July 22, 2016 GCP1 received a Writ of Restitution from the Pueblo County Colorado District Court ordering Suncanna to vacate GCP1 s greenhouse by September 6, 2016.  On August 31, 2016 a lawsuit was filed by Aaron Van Wingerden, owner of Suncanna, in Pueblo County Colorado District Court against GrowCo, GrowCo Business Development, LLC., GCP1, GrowCo Funding, LLC., TR Capital, Two Rivers and certain current and former employees, and associates.  The Company believes that the suit has no merit and will have no material impact on the Company s financial condition. 
   
 Our second greenhouse project will also consist of a 90,000 square foot greenhouse and a 15,000 square foot   processing and warehouse facility on an additional 40 acres of land.  Upon completion, this project will be operated, as a landlord, by a separate GrowCo subsidiary. Construction on this greenhouse began in early January 2016, with completion expected by the first quarter of 2017.  

7 

Table of Contents     
   
 During the third quarter of 2015, GrowCo completed a $4.0 million private placement of debt securities, with proceeds to be used to partially fund the second greenhouse and provide working capital. 
   
 In December 2015, GrowCo completed a $5.1 million private placement of equity interests of GCP Super Units, LLC, which will invest directly in various assets of GrowCo, with proceeds to be used to complete the construction of the first greenhouse, partially fund the second greenhouse and provide working capital.  Our investment in GCP Super Units, LLC is reflected on our balance sheet as a non-controlling equity interest. 
   
 In the first quarter of 2016, GrowCo obtained $300,000 in subscriptions and associated payments in a promissory note offering of up to $1.5 million. In September 2016 GrowCo changed the offering to two series of promissory notes with aggregate principal amounts of up to either $6 million or $7 million, in each case together with warrants to purchase, at a price of $0.25 per share, 1.0 GrowCo common shares for each dollar invested in the related promissory notes.  Of the $300,000 principal amount of notes issued earlier, $200,000 were exchanged for the new note and warrant packages and $100,000 remain outstanding.  As of November 7, 2016, GrowCo had raised $4.2 million, including the $200,000 of notes issued in exchange for the earlier offered notes. 
   
  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Principles of Consolidation  
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Two Rivers along with its farming, water and greenhouse operations. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   
  Basis of Presentation  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Item 210 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation for the periods presented have been included as required by Regulation S-X, Rule 10-01.  Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016.  It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2016. 
  Non-controlling Interest  
 Below is the detail of non-controlling interest shown on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Table of Contents     
   
 In 2015, $152,000 of TR Capital  Preferred Membership units were exchanged, pursuant to a pre-existing exchange agreement, for Two Rivers  common shares and $60,000 of Two Rivers Farms F-2, Inc. ( F-2 ) membership units converted into Two Rivers  common shares.  Two Rivers also formed three LLC special entities (TR Cap 20150630 Distribution, TR Cap 20150930 Distribution, and TR Cap 20151231) to provide in-kind distributions totaling $1,452,000 to holders of TR Capital Preferred Membership units. 
  Use of Estimates  
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents   
 For purposes of reporting cash flows, Two Rivers considers cash and cash equivalents to include highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Those are readily convertible into cash and not subject to significant risk from fluctuations in interest rates.  The recorded amounts for cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 
  Farm Product  
 Farm product represents expenses directly attributed to the planting and cultivation of the crops.  Upon harvesting, the farm product is reduced in proportion to the revenue generated.  The reduction of the farm product is recognized as direct cost of revenue. 
 Based on the current year crop plan gross margin is estimated to be 15%.  This gross margin percentage (15%) is used to estimate the direct cost of farm revenue for the interim periods along with the amount of farm product recognized on the balance sheet. For the nine-month period ending September 30, 2015, management estimated gross margin to be 20%.  It is management s estimate that the farm product is recorded at lower of cost or market. 
  Lease Revenues  
   
 The lease between GrowCo (through its subsidiary, GCP1) and its related party lessee, Suncanna, was classified as an operating lease.  Under ASC 840-10-25-1(a),   Lease Classification Criteria  , a lease is an operating lease if it does not meet any of the four criteria listed in ASC 840-10-25-1.  GrowCo s lease with Suncanna did not meet any of these criteria. 
   
 For the period September 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, Lease Revenue   Related Party was recognized monthly at the end of each month.  Total lease payments under the 60-month lease agreement, which are $11,151,000, are divided by the lease term.  Therefore, the average lease rate per month is $186,000.  This spreads the total amount of the lease payment stream over the life of the lease.   
   
 As of December 31, 2015, we had advanced $203,000 to our then related party tenant, Suncanna, to assist with its working capital.  ASC 605-45-45,   Revenue Recognition Principal Agent Considerations,   provides eight indicators that may support reporting gross revenue.  While GrowCo does not have any rights to Suncanna s cannabis inventory, Two Rivers determined that GrowCo is the primary obligor of Suncanna s working capital commitments, performed part of the service on behalf of Suncanna, was involved in the determination of services to Suncanna, and had credit risk.  Therefore, the $203,000 was recognized as an addition to Lease revenue   related party, with $203,000 shown as the direct cost of leasing revenue. 
   
 On April 14, 2016, we received notice from the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Colorado Department of Revenue that Suncanna had received a suspension order.  This caused Suncanna to be in violation of its lease with GCP1.  Therefore, GCP1 began an eviction process against Suncanna.  Due to the eviction process, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, we wrote off $743,000 in Lease Revenues   Related Party, wrote off $587,000 in advances to Suncanna, and did not recognize any Lease Revenues   Related Party.  The total write off of $1.330 million is partially off-set by a $350,000 reduction in the amount owed to the GCP1 preferred unit holders.

On July 22, 2016 the Company s GrowCo subsidiary, GrowCo Partners 1, LLC received a court ordered Writ of Restitution from the Pueblo County Colorado District Court ordering Suncanna, the Company s then tenant in its marijuana-focused greenhouse, to vacate the greenhouse by September 6, 2016. On September 6, 2016 the Company took possession of the greenhouse and began re-conditioning it for the new tenant who is expected to begin growing operations in November 2016. 
   
  Property and Equipment   
 Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each type of asset, which ranges from three to twenty-seven and a half years.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; improvements and betterments are capitalized.  Upon retirement or disposition, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are credited or charged to income.  
 Below is a summary of premises and equipment: 

Land  
 Land acquired for farming is recorded at cost.  Some of the land acquired has not been farmed for many years, if not decades.  Therefore, additional expenditures are required to make the land ready for efficient farming.  Expenditures for leveling the land are added to the cost of the land.  Irrigation is not capitalized in the cost of Land ( Property and Equipment  above). Land is not depreciated.  However, once per year, Management will assess the value of land held, and in their opinion, if the land has become impaired, Management will establish an allowance against the land. 
  Water Rights and Infrastructure  
 Subsequent to purchase of water rights and water infrastructure, management periodically evaluates the carrying value of its assets, and if the carrying value is in excess of fair market value, the Company will establish an impairment allowance.  Currently, there is a $30,000 impairment reserve on the Company s land and water shares.  No amortization or depreciation is taken on the water rights. 
  Intangibles  
 Two Rivers recognizes the estimated fair value of water rights acquired by the Company s purchase of stock in Huerfano Cucharas Irrigation Company ( HCIC ) and Orlando Reservoir No. 2 Company, LLC ( Orlando ).  These intangible assets will not be amortized because they have an indefinite remaining useful life based on many factors and considerations, including the historical upward valuation of water rights within Colorado.  
  Revenue Recognition   
  Farm Revenues  
 Revenues from farming operations are recognized when sold into the market.  All direct expenses related to farming operations are capitalized as farm inventory and recognized as a direct cost of sale upon the sale of the crops. 

10 

Table of Contents     
   
 Shipping costs invoiced to customers are shown as farm revenue.  Shipping costs paid by the Company are shown in the direct cost of farm revenue. 
  Member Assessments  
 Once per year the HCIC board estimates HCIC s expenses, less anticipated water revenues, and establishes an annual assessment per ownership share.  One-half of the member assessment is recorded in the first quarter of the calendar year and the other one-half of the member assessment is recorded in the third quarter of the calendar year.  Assessments paid by Two Rivers Water Company to HCIC are eliminated in consolidation of the condensed consolidated financial statements.  The assessments that are not eliminated are included in Other revenue. 
 HCIC does not reserve against any unpaid assessments.  Assessments due, but unpaid, are secured by the member s ownership of HCIC.  The value of this ownership is significantly greater than the annual assessments. 
  Stock Based Compensation  
 Beginning January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 718 and accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718.  Under the fair value recognition provisions of this standard, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally is the vesting period.  The Company elected the modified-prospective method, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes.  The valuation provisions of ASC 718 apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified.   
  Net (Loss) per Share  
 Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributed to Two Rivers available to common shareholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income for the period by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period. 
 The dilutive effect of the outstanding 489,000 RSUs, 3,879,867 options, and 17,802,908 warrants at September 30, 2016, has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share since, under ASC 260 they would anti-dilutive. 
  Recently   Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: identify the contract(s) with a customer; identify the performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 605,  Revenue Recognition , most industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the accounting standards codification, and some cost guidance related to construction-type and production-type contracts. ASU 2014-09 is effective for public entities for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , or ASU 2014-15. ASU 2014-15 amends FASB ASC 205-40  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern , by providing guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements, including requiring management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity s financial statements and providing certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going

 concern. ASU 2014-15 will be effective after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted.  We are still evaluating the impact of this ASU on our financial statement disclosures. 
 In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  Early adoption is allowed for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability will be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts.  The Company has elected to adopt this ASU in 2015 and is presented in these financial statements. The debt issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest method. 
   
 In February 2016, FASB issued a new lease accounting standard, ASU 2016-02,  Leases  (Topic 842). The new leasing standard presents changes to the balance sheets of lessees. The guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  Lessor accounting is updated to align with certain changes in the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard.  We are evaluating the impact of this ASU on our financial statement disclosures. 
   
 Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
  NOTE 3   INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS  
   
  Land   
   
 Upon purchasing land, the value is recorded at the purchase price or fair value, whichever is more appropriate.  Costs incurred to prepare the land for the intended purpose, which is efficient irrigated farming, is also capitalized in the recorded cost of the land.  No amortization or depreciation is taken on land.  However, the land is reviewed by management at least once per year to ascertain if a further analysis is necessary for any potential impairments. 
   
  Water Rights and Infrastructure  
   
 The Company has acquired both direct flow water rights and water storage rights.  It has obtained water rights through the purchase of shares in a mutual ditch company, which it accomplished through its purchase of shares in HCIC, or through the purchase of an entity holding water rights, which it effected through its purchase of a membership interest of Orlando.  The Company may also acquire water rights through outright purchase.  In all cases, such rights are recognized under decrees of the Colorado water court and administered under the jurisdiction of the Office of the State Engineer. 
   
 Subsequent to purchase, management periodically evaluates the carrying value of its assets, and if the carrying value is in excess of fair market value, the Company will establish an impairment allowance.  Currently, there are no impairments on the Company s land and water shares.  No amortization or depreciation is taken on the water rights. 
   
  GrowCo, GCP1, GCP2 Greenhouse Construction in Progress  
   
 Construction costs are capitalized, and not amortized or depreciated until the construction is completed in accordance with ASC 360 and 835.  The Company has completed the construction of its first greenhouse (90,000 square feet plus a 1,000 square feet boiler/mechanical room) and related warehouse facilities (15,000 square feet).

  HCIC Carry Back Loan  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company is in technical default on $6,660,000 of the HCIC carry back notes due to non-payment of principle.  Consequently, the entire amount of the notes have been classified as current.  Management has been in contact with the various holders about an extension to July 1, 2019.  As of September 30, 2016, management has received written commitments to extend $5,653,000 of these notes to July 1, 2019. 
  GrowCo $4M Notes  
 The $4.0 million of GrowCo notes are classified as current liabilities.  The notes are due April 1, 2020 however, the holders have the right to request full payment of the principal balance with a 60-day notice.  Management believes that none of the note holders will request the early principal payment option due to the high rate of interest and all noteholders are also investors in other securities of the Company. 
  DFP Crop Loan  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our farming subsidiary, Dionisio Farming and Produce, Inc. or DFP, issued short term notes, due January 31, 2017, to assist with the payment of crop inputs.  These notes are secured by crops in the ground via a UCC1 filing.  On July 22, 2016, Wayne Harding, our Chief Executive Officer, invested $20,000 in the DFP Crop Loan. 
  Hemp Crop Participation Loan  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, DFP issued short term notes, due March 31, 2017, to assist with the payment of crop inputs.  These notes are secured by the Company s live agriculture products planted during the 2016 calendar year.  On August 10, 2016, Wayne Harding, our Chief Executive Officer, invested $7,000 in the DFP Hemp Crop Participation Loan.

  NOTE 6   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
   
 On August 31, 2016 a lawsuit was filed by Aaron Van Wingerden, owner of Suncanna, in Pueblo County Colorado District Court against GrowCo, Inc., GrowCo Business Development, LLC., GrowCo Partners 1, LLC., GrowCo Funding, LLC., TR Capital Partners, LLC., Two Rivers Water   Farming Company and individuals both employed by the Company, former employees, and associates.  The Company believes that the suit is frivolous and has no merit and therefore, in the opinion of management, will have no material impact of the Company s financial condition. 
   
  NOTE 7   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the following related party transactions occurred: 
   
 On April 14, 2016, we received notice from the Marianna Enforcement Division of the Colorado Department of Revenue that Suncanna received a suspension order.  This caused Suncanna to be in violation of its lease with GCP1.  Therefore, GCP1 began eviction process against Suncanna.  Due the eviction process, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, we wrote off $743,000 in Lease Revenues   Related Party, wrote off $587,000 in advances to Suncanna, and did not recognized any Lease Revenues   Related Party.  The total write off of $1.287 million is partially off-set by a $350,000 reduction in the amount owed to the GCP1 preferred unit holders.  
   
 On May 2, 2016 converted GrowCo s $1.5 million promissory note offering to a $5.0 million promissory note offering at 22.5% per annum and included a warrant in Two Rivers common shares for each dollar invested at $0.50/share and a warrant in GrowCo common shares for each dollar invested.  Both warrants expire May 21, 2021.  The investors that invested in the $1.5 million note offering were offered an exchange to the $5.0 million note offering, of which $150,000 have converted.  As of May 6, 2016 GrowCo has raised $1.305 million, which includes those that converted from the $1.5 million promissory note offering. 
   
 On July 22, 2016 the Company s GrowCo subsidiary, GrowCo Partners 1, LLC received a court ordered Writ of Restitution from the Pueblo County Colorado District Court ordering Suncanna, the Company s tenant in its marijuana-focused greenhouse, to vacate the greenhouse by September 6, 2016 at 12:00 P.M MDT.  Suncanna vacated the greenhouse at that date and time. 
   
 In the quarter ended September 30, 2016 the Company paid MCG Services LLC $67,000 in fees related to capital raised.  John McKowen, the Company s former CEO and largest shareholder, is one of the owners of MCG Services. 
   
  NOTE 8   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
   
 Pursuant to ASC 855, management has evaluated all events and transactions that occurred from  September 30, 2016  through the date of issuance of these financial statements.  During this period, we had the following significant subsequent event: 
   
 Subsequent to the period ended September 30, 2016, in a contempt of court hearing, a Pueblo County Colorado District Court judge ruled in favor of plaintiff Aaron Van Wingerden and against GCP1 in a matter regarding the prevention of Suncanna s access to GCP1 s greenhouse prior to the plaintiff vacating the premises on September 6, 2016.  The Company believes that this ruling was in error and is considering an appeal.  Any potential loss from this will be immaterial.

  Overview  
 We have three core businesses: farming, developing greenhouses to lease to cannabis growers, and water.   
  Farming  
 We convert irrigated farmland   from traditional use, which grew marginally profitable feed crops,   to growing fruit and vegetable crops   that generate higher   yield, revenue and   operating margins.  Our business model is designed to provide us with increased profitability and cash flow that enables us to expand our farming operations by acquiring and developing additional irrigated farmland and associated water rights and infrastructure.   
   In 2016 we planted a total of 850 acres with no preventative planted acres.   Our planned crop production consisted of cabbage, pumpkins, squash, watermelon, onions, parsnips and pinto beans grown for human consumption, as well as feed/industrial crops, such as hemp and corn, planted as part of our crop rotation practice. 
 In 2015 we farmed a total of 973 gross acres, of which 661 gross acres were planted and 312 acres were preventive planted.  
 As capital becomes available, we will seek to expand our holdings by strategically acquiring or leasing irrigable farmland in the Arkansas River Basin.  We intend to develop and bring into production more of our currently held gross acres as we acquire additional water rights.  We also expect to increase the variety of crops and rotate to higher revenue producing crops as we continue to expand. 
  Greenhouse Development and Leasing  
   
 We seek to use our farmland and associated water to create revenue streams.  In the past, we had focused on converting, through our Farms operations, farmland and associated water rights to higher-yield, revenue and margin crops.  With the legalization of recreational use of marijuana in Colorado in 2012, we identified the potential use of certain of our farmland for lease to licensed marijuana growers.  In May 2014, we formed GrowCo, Inc., or GrowCo, to focus and lead our efforts to take advantage of the rapidly growing demand for marijuana.  GrowCo initially issued 20,000,000 shares of its common stock to us, and in August 2014 we announced that we were reserving 10,000,000 of those GrowCo shares for distribution to holders of Common Stock as of four record dates (January 1, 2015; April 1, 2015; July 1, 2015 and October 1, 2015) after a registration statement covering GrowCo common shares has been filed and declared effective, which has not yet occurred.

 Under GrowCo, a separate Colorado limited liability company will own each greenhouse project. 
   
 In January 2015 the initial GrowCo greenhouse subsidiary, GrowCo Partners 1, LLC or GCP1, began fund raising and construction planning activities for the first greenhouse project.  The GCP1 greenhouse consists of a 90,000 square foot greenhouse (plus a 1,000 square feet boiler/mechanical room) and a 15,000 square foot processing and warehouse facility on 40 acres of land.  Our construction costs for the GCP1 greenhouse totaled $5.3 million. The GCP1 greenhouse was leased to Suncanna, LLC, or Suncanna, with lease payments scheduled to commence as of September 1, 2015.  As of December 31, 2015, we had recorded lease receivables of $700,000 and deferred rent of $43,400 in connection with the Suncanna lease arrangements.  In 2016, the Suncanna lease arrangement has been the subject of administrative and judicial proceedings: 
   
 On April 14, 2016 we were notified that Suncanna LLC had received a notice of suspension from the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Colorado Department of Revenue.  This suspension remains in place until a hearing, which is currently set for November 14, 2016. 
   
 Due to the suspension order, Suncanna was in violation of its lease agreement with us.  On April 25, 2016, GCP1 terminated Suncanna s lease and began an eviction process against Suncanna.  Consequently, during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, we stopped recognizing lease revenue and wrote off the $700,000 lease receivable and $43,400 deferred rent that had been recorded as of December 31, 2015.  We also wrote off advances to Suncanna of $587,000.   
   
 On July 22, 2016 GCP1 received a Writ of Restitution from the Pueblo County Colorado District Court ordering Suncanna to vacate the greenhouse by September 6, 2016.   
   
 On August 31, 2016 a lawsuit was filed by Aaron Van Wingerden, owner of Suncanna, in Pueblo County Colorado District Court against GrowCo, GrowCo Business Development, LLC, GCP1, GrowCo Funding, LLC., TR Capital, Two Rivers and certain current and former employees, and associates.  We believe that the suit has no merit and will have no material impact on our financial condition. 
   
 On September 6, 2016, in accordance with the Writ of Restitution, Suncanna vacated the greenhouse and GCP1 took possession and began re-conditioning its greenhouse for a new tenant, who is expected to begin growing operations in the fourth quarter of2016. 
   
 On October 27, 2016, in a contempt of court hearing, a Pueblo County Colorado District Court judge ruled in favor of plaintiff Aaron Van Wingerden and against GCP1 in a matter regarding the prevention of Suncanna s access to GCP1 s greenhouse prior to Suncanna vacating the premises on September 6, 2016.  We believe that this ruling was in error and are considering an appeal. 
   
 Our second greenhouse project will be operated by GrowCo Partners 2, LLC, or GCP2, a subsidiary of GrowCo.  This project will consist of a 90,000 square foot greenhouse and a 15,000 square foot processing and warehouse facility on 40 acres of land.  The GCP2 greenhouse structure was ordered in 2015, construction began in January 2016, and completion is projected for the first quarter of 2017.  Our construction costs for the GCP2 greenhouse totaled $2.5 million through September 30, 2016, and we estimate that an additional expenditure of $3.5 million will be required to complete construction.  For a summary of financing activities in connection with the GCP2 greenhouse, please see   Liquidity and Capital Resources  below.

  Water  
  Current Rights Holdings  
 In Colorado it is important to have both surface and storage rights, which we do.  To date, we have acquired, managed and used our water assets principally for use in irrigation, to increase the value and yield of our farmland.  While the majority of our assets relate to water, our efforts have focused on our farmland and, more recently, our marijuana greenhouse projects.   
   
 Outside of our ownership of shares of the Bessemer Irrigation Company, we owned the following surface water rights as of November 7, 2016: 

* 
 A.F.  = Acre Feet 
 ** 
 cfs = cubic feet per second 
   
 The following table presents our holdings of storage water rights as of November 7, 2016: 

* 
 This storage right is only one of three reservoirs included in the Reed Decree.  This Decree allows for multiple fillings per year.  Other storage rights only allow for a single storage per year. 
 ** 
 This is a conditional right while the engineering and construction of structures are completed to perfect a water right, in this case to physically store the water.  The conditional right establishes a seniority date but allows time for completion of the project.  Conditional rights are reviewed every six years by the water court to confirm that progress is being made on the effort to perfect the right.  When a conditional water right is perfected, which can be done incrementally in the case of storage, the water right becomes absolute. 
   
  New Strategic Initiative  
 With our initial marijuana greenhouse projects gaining traction, in the third quarter of 2016 we determined to investigate whether our water assets might have revenue potential of their own, separate from use in irrigating our farmland, that could benefit our stakeholders, including our shareholders and the communities near where our water assets are located.  On September 30, 2016, our board of directors established a board-level water committee to identify opportunities for our existing water assets, and perhaps acquired water assets. As a result of the success of that investigation, water is a new top-priority for our Company. 

19 

Table of Contents     
   
 Based on findings from our water committee, we believe we have several opportunities to capitalize on water assets that we currently own or can acquire, in order to address serious storage and supply challenges faced by municipalities, ranches, farmlands and other commercial enterprises in the Arkansas River Basin.  In order to address these opportunities, we have identified the following: 

We will seek to address the need for municipal water storage.   
   
 We believe there are a variety of opportunities to lease, both short term and long term, our water assets.  
   
 We have identified underutilized land and water that we own that could be used to expand our irrigated farming operations.   
   
 In January 2011, we entered into a water supply agreement to supply water resources for real estate development in Huerfano County, Colorado.   
  Results of Operations  
   
  For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded revenues of $2,289,000, of which $2,282,000 was farming revenue, compared to $1,685,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, of which $1,497,000 was farming revenue.  The sale of agriculture products is highly seasonal and occurs primarily in the third and fourth quarter of the year.  The increase of $785,000 in farming revenue was primarily due to better yields per acre and rotation to higher revenue crops.  In the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we recorded revenue from our GCP1 greenhouse of $175,000, which was subsequently written off in 2016 due to the default of the tenant.  In the quarter ended September 30, 2016, other revenues were de minimis.   
   
 Operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $686,000 and $469,000, respectively. The increase of $217,000 was primarily due to legal costs.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a loss from operations of $537,000 and $97,000, respectively.  
   
 Other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $498,000 and $334,000.  The increase of $164,000 was largely due to interest expense. 
   
 As the result of the foregoing, the net loss attributed to our common shareholders, after recognizing preferred distributions and income attributed to non-controlling interest, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,729,000, compared to a loss of $1,141,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase of $588,000 is due primarily to the reasons stated above.   
   
  For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had revenues of $2,474,000, $2,409,000 of which was from farming, $40,000 from leases (classified as other) and $25,000 from the greenhouse.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we had revenues of $1,726,000, $1,519,000 of which was from farming, $32,000 from leases, and $175,000 from the greenhouse.  The increase of $890,000 in farming revenue was due to better yields per acre and rotation to higher revenue crops. 
   
 Operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,902,000 and $1,204,000, respectively. The increase of $1,698,000 was primarily due to higher general and administrative expense resulting from the write-off of Suncanna accounts receivable and advances in the first quarter and higher legal fees.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a loss from operations of $3,017,000 and $1,081,000, respectively.  
   
 Other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,318,000 and $859,000 respectively.  The increase of $459,000 was largely due to interest expense.

Table of Contents     
   
 After recognizing the preferred distributions and the income attributed to non-controlling interest in GCP Super Units, LLC, the net loss attributed to our common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,280,000, compared to a net loss of $3,698,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 We historically have funded our operations primarily from the following sources: 
   
 proceeds of private placements of equity, equity-related and debt securities of Two Rivers Water   Farming Company and subsidiaries; 
   
 cash flow generated from operations; and 
   
 loans and lines of credit. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $603,000.  As of September 30, 2016, we had no available line or letters of credit and do not intend to seek any such financing in the foreseeable future. 
   
 We currently expect that our cash expenditures will increase for the foreseeable future, as we seek to further expand our farming business, monetize our water assets, and continue expanding marijuana greenhouse projects.  As a result, our existing cash and cash equivalents and other working capital may not be sufficient to meet all of the projected cash needs contemplated by our business strategies for the remainder of 2016 and for 2017.  To the extent our cash and cash equivalents and other working capital are insufficient to fund our planned activities, we may need to either slow our growth initiatives or raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings.  We also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to affect one or more acquisitions of businesses, technologies and products.  If additional funding is required, we cannot assure that we will be able to affect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
   
  Sources of Funds  
   
 Cash flows generated by our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.9 million compared to $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we completed our GCP Super Units, LLC offering, closed on $3.5 million of GrowCo debt, and reduced $355,000 in principal on our existing debt. 
   
 In the first quarter of 2016, GrowCo obtained $300,000 in subscriptions and associated payments in a promissory note offering of up to $1.5 million. In September 2016 GrowCo changed the offering to two series of promissory notes with aggregate principal amounts of up to either $6 million or $7 million, in each case together with warrants to purchase, at a price of $0.25 per share, 0.25 GrowCo common shares for each dollar invested in the related promissory notes.  Of the $300,000 principal amount of notes issued earlier, $200,000 were exchanged for the new note and warrant packages and $100,000 remain outstanding.  As of November 7, 2016, GrowCo had raised $4.2 million, including the $200,000 of notes issued in exchange for the earlier offered notes. 
   
 Cash flow from operations has not historically been sufficient to sustain our operations.  Cash flow consumed by our operating activities totaled $2,123,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $2,998,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   
  Uses of Funds  
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $3,226,000 in current assets and $18,776,000 in current liabilities. Of the current liabilities, $6,660,000 is from seller carry back notes of our subsidiary Huerfano Cucharas Irrigation Company, or HCIC, that were due September 30, 2016, but have not been paid.  As of September 30, 2016, we are in default on the HCIC note payments.  As a result, the entire amount of the notes has been classified as current.  Management has been in contact with the various holders about an extension to July 1, 2019.  As of September 30, 2016, management had received written commitments to extend $5,653,000 of these notes to July 1, 2019. The HCIC seller carry back notes have the HCIC ditch system as collateral, with an appraised value of $24,216,000. 

21 

Table of Contents     
   
 Additionally, another $4.0 million of GrowCo notes are classified as current liabilities.  The notes are due April 1, 2020; however, the holders have the right to request full payment of the principal balance with a 60-day notice.  While do not expect that noteholders will request the early principal payment option, we cannot assure you of that result, which would require us to raise additional funds for early payment. 

Cash used in investing activities was $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased $125,000 in farming equipment, invested $446,000 in our water assets and continued on our construction of GCP1 and GCP2 greenhouse of $2.2 million.  We estimate that our capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2016 will total approximately $3.5 million. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
   
 We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results from operations.  The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.  For a detailed discussion   of the application of these and other accounting policies, see   Note 2   of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this   Form 10-Q  .  Our preparation of such condensed consolidated financial statements and this Form 10-Q requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. 
   
  Revenue Recognition  
   
 We follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue; however, certain judgments may affect the application of our revenue policy.  Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses. 
   
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
   
 We have acquired water shares in Huerfano-Cucharas Irrigation Company, which is considered an intangible asset and shown on our balance sheet as part of  Water assets.   Currently, these shares are recorded at purchase price less our pro rata share of the negative net worth in HCIC Holdings, LLC.  Management evaluates the carrying value, and if necessary, will establish an impairment of value to reflect current fair market value.  Currently, there are no impairments on the water shares.  
   
 In 2012, we acquired a produce business, which is considered an intangible asset and shown on our balance sheet as  Intangible assets, net.   Management evaluated the purchase price of $1.0 million and allocated this price to customer list, trade name and goodwill.

Table of Contents     
   
  Capitalization of Certain Interest Expenses  
   
 As part of our GrowCo development operations, which began in July 2014, we incur large construction costs, which are capitalized.  The related interest expenses incurred related to these expenditures can be capitalized per ASC 720-15.  This guidance states that interest should be capitalized in relation to the following assets:  (i) assets that are constructed or otherwise produced for an entity s own use, (ii) assets intended for sale or lease that are constructed or otherwise produced as discrete projects, and (iii) investments accounted for by the equity method while the investee has activities in progress necessary to commence its planned principal operations.  As the GrowCo assets classify under the second point, we began the process of calculating interest costs to be capitalized each quarter.  Interest capitalization begins when the expenditures begin and interest is being incurred.  Management independently determines the start point for each individual project when it commences.  At the end of each quarter, management will then take the average accumulated expenditures for each project, multiplied by the interest rate on the associated debt (or the weighted average rate on all debt if no debt is specifically associated) to arrive at a capitalized interest amount.  This amount will be booked as an adjustment to interest expense each quarter.  Once the construction process ends and the asset is deemed ready for use, capitalization of interest will cease. 
   
  Impairment Policy  
   
 At least once every year, management examines all of our assets for proper valuation and to determine if an impairment is necessary.  In terms of real estate owned, this impairment examination also includes the accumulated depreciation.  Management examines market valuations and if an additional impairment is necessary for lower of cost or market, then an impairment charge is recorded.

  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
 We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and change in the market values of our real estate properties and water assets.  Because we had no market risk sensitive instruments outstanding as of September 30, 2016, it was determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of such date.  We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
   
    ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
    Management s Evaluation of Disclosures Controls and Procedures  
 Our management, comprised of the same person acting as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.  The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as described above.  Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting.   Internal control over financial reporting  is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
   
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of a company; 
   
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of a company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of a company; and 
   
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, which may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
   
 On August 31, 2016 a lawsuit was filed by Aaron Van Wingerden, owner of Suncanna, in Pueblo County Colorado District Court against GrowCo, GrowCo Business Development, LLC, GCP1, GrowCo Funding, LLC., TR Capital, Two Rivers and certain current and former employees, and associates.  We believe that the suit has no merit and will have no material impact on our financial condition. 
   
 On October 27, 2016, in a contempt of court hearing, a Pueblo County Colorado District Court judge ruled in favor of plaintiff Aaron Van Wingerden and against GCP1 in a matter regarding the prevention of Suncanna s access to GCP1 s greenhouse prior to Suncanna vacating the premises on September 6, 2016.  We believe that this ruling was in error and are considering an appeal.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  
   
 The risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    Those risk factors do not identify all risks that we face  , and operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.

Exhibit 10.1  
 Orlando Water Service Agreement 
  SERVICE AGREEMENT  
   
 THIS SERVICE AGREEMENT (the  Agreement ), dated the 28 th  day of January, 2011 (the  Effective Date ), is between  THE ORLANDO RESERVOIR NO. 2 COMPANY, LLC,  a Colorado limited liability company (referred to hereinafter as  Orlando ),  MARKSHEFFEL  WOODMEN INVESTMENTS, LLC,  a Colorado limited liability company (referred to hereinafter as  MWI ),  TWO RIVERS WATER COMPANY,  a Colorado corporation (referred to hereinafter as  Two Rivers ), and  TRW ORLANDO WATER ASSET, LLC,  a Colorado limited liability company ( TRW ). Orlando, MWI, Two Rivers, and TRW are individually referred to hereinafter as a  Party  and collectively as the  Parties.  
  Recitals  
   
 A. 
 Two Rivers and TRW are in the business of acquiring, developing, managing and administering water rights and water resources for agricultural, energy, and future municipal uses. 
 B. 
 Orlando and MWI, through affiliate companies and parties, collectively own or control approximately 7,000 acres of real property in Huerfano County, Colorado, which is more particularly described on  Exhibit  A  attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference  (the  Land ). 
 C. 
 The Land is in close proximity to Orlando Reservoir No. 2. and Orlando, which is affiliated with MWI, plans to utilize water from Orlando Reservoir No. 2 in support of MWI's planned development of the Land. 
 D. 
 Orlando owns and is contemporaneously herewith closing on the sale to Two Rivers of Orlando Reservoir No. 2 and a number of water rights (the   Water  Rights ) a described in and pursuant to that certain Purchase Agreement dated September 22, 20IO between Two Rivers and Orlando (the  Purchase Agreement ). The Water Rights are described on  Exhibit B  attached to this Agreement. 
 E. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Two Rivers, TRW, and Orlando are entering into this Service Agreement to document the Parties' agreement regarding future water service to be provided to MWI's Future Development (as defined below), administration of the Water Rights, and a Recreational Use Easement in favor of the Future Development, the terms of which are being agreed upon contemporaneously herewith. A copy of the Recreational Use Easement which is being concurrently executed with the Purchase Agreement closing is attached hereto as  Exhibit C.  

Agreement  
   
 In consideration of the foregoing Recitals, which are incorporated herein, the closing pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the mutual covenants of the Parties contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged by the Parties, the Parties agree as follows: 

1.)  Commitment to Provide Water Service for Future Development. As noted above, Two Rivers and TRW are in the business of acquiring, developing, managing and administering water rights and water resources for agricultural, energy, and future municipal uses. TRW, as assignee of Two Rivers, is acquiring the Water Rights to use those Water Rights initially for agricultural purposes, but with the commitment to MWI, as more particularly set forth below, to convert them to municipal water rights to be used to support MWI's development of the Land. MWI, directly or through its assigns, intends in the future to subdivide and develop the Land for uses  which  include,   but  are  not  limited  to,  a  mixed  commercial,   industrial,   residential, recreational  and  other  mixed  use development  (the  Future Development ).  Subject to the time frame set forth below, upon written notice from MWI to TRW that the Future Development will need water service (a  Water Service Request ), TRW agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to finalize the provision of potable water for municipal water supplies and service to the Future Development from the Water Rights transferred to TRW pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, which is currently estimated to provide in excess of 5,000 single family equivalent  ( SFE )  water  service taps ( Taps ).  The term SFE is not intended to limit the application of the Water Rights for the benefit of only single family homes, but is used as an engineering term of measurement which is customarily used in the industry. TRW shall reserve for the benefit of MWI the annual consumptive use water associated with the Water Rights, as finally determined by the Water Court, which amount is estimated to be sufficient to supply water to MWI for approximately 5,000 SFEs. Subject to its rights under Paragraph 2(c) below, TRW shall not commit to provide any other water, or to serve any other use, with water from the Water Rights (other than for irrigation as provided in paragraphs 8 and 9 herein), unless and until this reservation and obligation to MWE is completely satisfied. In addition, TRW's long-term plans include efforts to acquire additional water rights within this area which would in significant part be stored in the Orlando Reservoir No. 2 and could augment TR.W's ability to provide water service to the Future Development.  However, TRW's obligations hereunder are limited to providing water to the Future Development (following the Water Service Request as set forth above) as may be produced from the Water Rights with competent and prudent water resource management.  The Parties acknowledge  that  TRW  and Two Rivers are not guarantying the amount of water that may be available to the Future Development in the future from the Water Rights as how much water is ultimately provided from the Water Rights is subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, governmental  approvals  and  climatic changes.  TRW  and Two Rivers are, however, promising to use competence and to prudently manage the  water  resources and use all  commercially  reasonable  efforts to maximize  the  number of Taps that can  be obtained  from the Water Rights. 
 2.)  New Service Request Processing. 
   
  A.  
  General . MWI shall not be entitled to deliver a Water Service Request to TRW prior to the date that is three (3) years from the Effective Date of this Agreement unless expressly agreed to in writing by TRW. When MWI anticipates that it will commence development, MWI will deliver a Water Service Request to TRW. The Parties understand that the Future Development will likely be constructed in phases and that MWI will provide multiple Water Service Requests to TRW which correlate with the phases of the Future Development. With each Water Service Request, MWI will notify TRW of its anticipated build out for that particular phase (total number of SFE's), anticipated build out schedule for that phase and, therefore, the number of Taps anticipated to be needed for that phase. With its first Water Service Request, MWI will also notify TRW of its then current estimate of the total build out of the Future Development and the maximum number of Taps that are projected to be needed, understanding that this number will be subject to change based on future planning and the results of entitlement efforts. 
  B.  
  Processing of Water Service Requests .  Upon receiving a Water Service Request, TRW, at its expense and with the assistance of Two Rivers, will commence and diligently pursue thereafter efforts to obtain needed approvals to convert that portion of the Water Rights from agricultural to municipal water as is necessary to satisfy the Water Service Request to support that particular phase of the Future Development, and TRW, with the assistance of Two Rivers, shall use its best efforts to process those applications quickly and successfully to completion. MWI shall cooperate with TRW and Two Rivers as needed in the application process, but MWI shall not be responsible for any costs incurred by TRW in those efforts but MWI shall not be responsible for any costs incurred by TRW in those efforts. Additionally, TRW, with the assistance of Two Rivers, will also promptly commence the  

design, engineering and permitting of a water treatment plant and water distribution system sized to serve the Future Development, and construct those facilities in appropriate phases as soon as reasonably possible. MWI and TRW will at least quarterly update each other as to the progress of their respective projects and obligations during the land entitlement, water rights adjudication proceedings, and design, permitting and construction of the water treatment plant and distribution systems. The Parties acknowledge that both the land entitlement application process with Huerfano County for the Future Development and the adjudication process of converting the Water Rights from agricultural to municipal water rights to serve the Future Development will take a number of months and may be delayed beyond the control of the Parties, but that the Parties agree to pursue those efforts, to the best of each Party's ability, concurrently and diligently once MWI has issued a Water Service Request. 
  C.  
  TRW's Right to Terminate.  MWI may, in its discretion (but subject to the three- year waiting period), select the time to deliver the various Water Service Requests, provided, however, that if MWI has not submitted its first Water Service Request to TRW within ten (I 0) years from the Effective Date of this Agreement, then MWI's rights hereunder may be terminated in accordance with the following procedures: If MWI has not issued its first Water Service Request to TRW within ten (I 0) years from the Effective Date of this Agreement, and if TRW desires to terminate its future water service obligations to MWI here under, then TRW shall give MWI written notice of TRW's desire to terminate its future water service obligations to MWI hereunder (an  Intent to Terminate Notice ), in which case MWI shall  have the right, within one (1) year of receipt of that Intent to Terminate Notice, within which to issue to TRW either (a) a Water Service Request (as hereinafter defined) or (b) an Extension Notice (as hereinafter defined).  A  Water Service Request  from MWI shall be deemed a commitment from MWI that it is proceeding forward with entitlement work for its Future Development and will be in need of municipal water service in the future and that TRW is expected to commence the necessary water service applications and planning for the water distribution facilities needed to serve the Future Development as provided for herein.  In the event MWI timely provides a Water Service Request to TRW after receipt of such Intent to Terminate Notice, then the water service obligations of TRW hereunder shall continue in full force and effect as if no Intent to Terminate Notice was issued provided, however, that MWI, with its Water Service Request notice to TRW, includes payment of the Water Resource Fee (as defined below) for at least 50 SFE Taps and notifies TRW that MWI is requesting service and committing thereafter  to purchase at least 50 SFE Taps per year until the Future Development is fully serviced with municipal water.  If  MWI  merely  desires  to  extend  its  rights  and  TRW's  water service obligations under this Agreement, then MWI may issue an Extension Notice, accompanied by payment equal to the Water Resource Fee for 50 SFE Taps, which shall mean that MWI is merely extending TRW's obligations under this Agreement for an additional year, and with the understanding that TRW's will be entitled to terminate this Agreement one year from the date of MWI's Extension Notice unless MWI again pays an extension fee in the amount of the Water Resource Fee for an additional 50 SFE Taps that next year, and with annual extensions  continuing  thereafter  until  MWI  either  issues  a  Service  Request  or  fails to extend.  It is understood and agreed between the Parties that if MWI issues a Service Request, its payments shall be deemed prepayment for Taps, and that MWI may purchase those Taps and hold them in escrow until MWI has a customer to utilize those Taps that were purchased by MWI pursuant to this provision. If MWI does not issue either a Water  Service  Request  or  an  Extension  Notice within that one (I) year period from the date of the Intent to Terminate Notice, or fails to pay the Water Resource Fee for at least fifty (50) SFE Taps  per  year  pursuant  to  the  foregoing  provisions, then TRW shall be entitled to terminate its future water service obligations to MWI hereunder  by written  notice to MWI so terminating  this Agreement. 
  D.  
  Self Help . If TRW fails to honor a Water Service Request from MWI which is issued after the initial three (3) year waiting period and does not cure that breach within the notice and cure period under Paragraphs 13 and 14 of this Agreement, then MWI, in addition to any other remedies provided for herein or at law, shall be entitled to self-help to design, plan and construct water treatment and water distribution facilities to serve the  Future  Development and/or contract with other third parties to provide water service and those facilities. 

3.)  Costs for Water Supplied. TRW will charge MWI or a metropolitan district established by MWI for the support of the Future Development ( MWl's District ), for the raw water delivered at an initial water resource charge equal to $6,500.00 per SFE Tap (the  Water Resource Fee ), which calculation shall also apply for other non-residential uses. If TRW elects to treat the water and deliver potable water for the Future Development as contemplated herein, then TRW, in addition to the Water Resource Fee, shall be entitled to charge a development fee (the  Water Development Fee ) calculated to amortize the capital costs to construct and provide the treatment facility and distribution system over its useful life, with a fair rate of return on that capital investment. 
 TRW will notify MWI of its decision to either provide or not provide water treatment services within thirty (30) days from the date of the Water Service Request from MWI. The Water Resource Fee and the Water Development Fee shall be due and payable at the time of an application for a building permit for a structure based on the number of SFE Taps to be required for that new structure within the Future Development. If TRW elects not to treat and distribute water to the Future Development, MWI will be entitled to do so with that activity not constituting a breach of this Agreement or any covenant not to compete, in which case TRW will still provide the raw water to the Future Development and shall be entitled to the Water Resource Fee (but not the Water Development Fee) in accordance with this Paragraph 3. 
   
 4.)  Wastewater Service. TRW is not offering to provide wastewater service to the Future Development and the Parties understand that MWI will be solely responsible for any wastewater facilities needed to support the Future Development. TRW agrees, without any monetary obligation to TRW, to reasonably cooperate with MWI (and MWI's Districts or property owners associations, as provided for below) in efforts to permit, establish and construct any wastewater facilities to serve the Future Development. If TRW is providing water service to the Future Development, then MWI agrees that TRW shall be entitled to the credit for the return flows, if any, from any wastewater facilities installed by MWI or its affiliates for the Future Development. Nothing in this Paragraph 4. is intended to represent or guaranty to TRW or Two Rivers any amount of return flow credits in the future, or to obligate MWI to install  any particular type of wastewater treatment facilities or equipment, all of which shall be in MWI's sole and absolute discretion. 
   
 5.)  Creation of Special District or Property Owners Association for TRW. 
  A.  
  TRW . Orlando and MWI acknowledge that TRW or Two Rivers may desire to form a Title 32 or similar special district and quasi-municipal government which can hold title to the Water Rights and administer the Water Rights and deliver the water to the Future Development in accordance with this Agreement ( TRW's District ). MWI agrees to cooperate with TRW in those efforts and MWI agrees that TRW may assign its rights under this Agreement to TRW's District, subject to the requirements in this Agreement, and TRW's District may perform the obligations of TRW under this Agreement, provided that TRW's District expressly assumes and agrees to perform TRW's obligations under this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall obligate MWI to annex any of its Land into TRW's District. 
  B.  
  MWI . MWI may form one or more Title 32 or similar districts or other entities to hold MWI's rights under this Agreement and receive and distribute the raw water to be delivered by TRW for the Future Development ( MWI's Districts ). MWI's Districts may also construct the water treatment plant and water distribution facilities that may be needed to treat the raw water received for the Future Development if TRW does not provide for the treatment of the water for human consumptive use. MWI's Districts may also provide other infrastructure for the Future Development, as determined by MWI in MWI's sole discretion.  If MWI is not successful in forming MWI's Districts, MWI may, at its expense, form one or more property owners association ( POA's ) for the Future Development which may perform the functions contemplated to be formed by MWI's Districts. TRW agrees to cooperate with MWI in those efforts and TRW agrees that MWI may assign its rights under this Agreement to one or more of MWI's Districts or POA's and they may perform MWI's obligations under this Agreement, provided that MWI's Districts or POA's, as applicable, expressly assume and agree to perform MWI's obligations under this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall obligate TRW or Two Rivers to annex any property into MWI's Districts or POA's. 

6.)  Recreational Easement. TRW acknowledges that MWI desires to use the Orlando Reservoir No. 2 as a recreational amenity and marketing tool for the Future Development and TRW agrees to accommodate such recreational use of the Orlando Reservoir No. 2 subject, however, to the following provisions. TRW and MWI will contemporaneously herewith record a Recreational Use Easement in the form of  Exhibit C  attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference (the  Recreational Easement ). The Parties agree, however, to make such future modifications to the Recreational Easement as may be required to comply with any applicable laws and regulations or with generally accepted practices for management of municipal water resources in effect at the time of the efforts by TRW to convert the water rights as needed to service the Future Development. At the time MWI commences tl1e entitlement process for the development of the Future Development, the Recreational Easement shall be reviewed and modified, as and if necessary. TRW also acknowledges and consents to MWI's intent to assign the Recreational Easement in the future to MWl's Districts or POA's formed for the Future Development or to another successor to MWI which will hold the Recreational Easement for the benefit of the Future Development and owners within the Future Development. TRW agrees to administer the Water Rights consistent with the terms and limitations of the Recreational Easement as modified or amended in the future as contemplated herein. 
   
 7.)  Administration of Water Rights. From and after the Closing, TRW, in conjunction with Two Rivers, covenants and agrees to, and shall be solely responsible for the costs and efforts required to, maintain the Water Rights in good standing and for the preparation and maintenance of all documentation and record keeping necessary or helpful to that purpose. 
   
 Additionally, TRW, in conjunction with Two Rivers, will be responsible  for  and  agrees  to  prepare, pay the application fees for and prosecute any and all water rights applications and cases necessary to restore the consumptive  use of the Water Rights initially, and  later change the use of  the Water Rights in accordance with TRW's plans, investments and activities, including TRW's agreement to serve municipal water to  the  Future  Development  pursuant  to  this  Agreement.  MWI agrees, if requested by TRW, to assist and cooperate with TRW in those efforts, but MWI shall not be responsible for any costs incurred  by TRW in   those efforts.  TRW agrees to periodically, but not less often than quarter annually,  keep  MWI informed  of its planned  actions with regard  to the  Water  Rights and  provide  MWI with  the opportunity  to  review  and comment on all applications and related filings, including any pertinent engineering data and  reports,  regarding those Water Rights prior to TRW filing the applications  with  appropriate  authorities. TRW and Two Rivers agree to take all commercially reasonable actions that may be necessary to protect or preserve  the Water Rights. 
   
 8.)  TRW's Irrigation Rights. To assist  TRW  in  further  developing  and  maintaining the Water Rights, to the extent owned  by MWI, MWI agrees to allow TRW  to apply  the water to  the land historically irrigated by the  Water  Rights  with  the condition  that those  irrigation  rights and the application  of water for  beneficial  consumptive  use will not  interfere with MWI's  ability to graze or hunt on the property. Approximately 1,600 acres  of  land  are  identified  by  the applicable water decrees as having been historically  irrigated  by  the  Water  Rights,  and  the  Parties are endeavoring to more accurately identify the 1,600 acres that have  been  historically irrigated by the Water Rights and which of those 1,600 acres are owned by MWI (the  lnigable Land ). Once those acres have been identified, the Parties  will  agree  on  an  exhibit  which  identifies  those acres  which shall  constitute  the  Irrigable  Land,  and attach that exhibit as  Exhibit D  to this Agreement. TRW's right to irrigate the Irrigable Land shall be for a five (5) year period from the Effective Date of this Agreement, and thereafter until MWI or MWI's Affiliates gives TRW not Jess than six months notice that MWI is terminating those irrigation rights. If MWI gives a notice of termination to TRW based on MWI's anticipated need for municipal water and desire to have TRW commence the process of converting the Water Rights to municipal water rights, then TRW's rights to irrigate the Irrigable Land shall terminate six (6) months from such termination notice, unless TRW offers to provide MWI with the municipal water from some other available source of municipal water. Notwithstanding the foregoing, commencing on the date ten years from the date of this Agreement, MWI may terminate any further rights of TRW to irrigate the Irrigable Land by providing TRW not Jess than three (3) months notice of such termination. 

9.)   Farming of the Irrigable  Land and  Compensation  for Application  of Water Rights. 
 Commencing during calendar year 2013, TRW agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to commence farming operations on the Irrigable Land. TRW may conduct such farming without additional compensation to MWI through the end of the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date and thereafter subject to MWI's termination rights as provided for in Paragraph 8 above. From and after the Effective Date, TRW and Two Rivers agree to pay MWI $40.00 per acre foot of water per year of the water from the Water Rights utilized by TRW for farming or other operations on any land other than the Irrigable Land as measured either at the decreed point of diversion, or a measuring device approved by the Parties, at TRW's option, for those other lands. 
   
 10.) Grazing. MWI and its affiliates  currently  use the  Land  for  grazing  and  have a grazing lease in place with Tom Sikes (the  Grazing Lease ). Pursuant to the Grazing Lease,  livestock  graze  up to  the  water's edge  and drink  water  from  Orlando  No. 2 Reservoir  and from the ditches related thereto ( Grazing Activities ). TRW consents to the continued Grazing Activities by MWI and MWI's tenants, provided, however, that TRW shall be entitled to cause MWI to terminate the Grazing Lease and further Grazing activities within the Irrigable Land upon not less than twelve (12) months written notice from TRW to MWI. In such event, TRW, at its expense, shall be entitled to fence off the Irrigable Land. 
   
 11.) Assignment of Agreement. TRW may, without MWI's or Orlando's consent, assign this Agreement to TRW's District or to an entity in which TRW holds at least a fifty percent (50%) interest. In conjunction with the assignment, TRW agrees to have TRW's District assume TRW's obligations under this Agreement. At and following Closing, MWI and Orlando shall be entitled to assign their rights under this Agreement to MWI's Districts or to the POA's or to any successor or proportionately to any successors to the Future Development or to any land purchased by MWI that may be capable of utilizing the water to be delivered under this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement. Each Party shall notify the other Parties in writing in advance of or concurrently with any assignment of this Agreement to any of the foregoing entities. 
   
 12.) Mutual Cooperation. The Parties agree to work cooperatively with each other and communicate as necessary in an effort to maximize each Party's benefits and minimize each Party's costs associated with this Agreement. In that regard, TRW agrees in the future to grant to MWI or MWJ's Districts such additional access and utility easements as may be reasonably necessary or helpful to the full development of the Future Development and beneficial use and enjoyment of the Recreational Easement (as amended or modified as contemplated herein) and any other rights under this Agreement. MWI agrees in the future to grant to TRW or TRW's District such additional access and utility easements as may be reasonably necessary or helpful to the full use and enjoyment of the Orlando Reservoir No. 2 and the Water Rights in accordance with the intent of this Agreement. Additionally, TRW shall cooperate with and not oppose any land use entitlement applications submitted for the Future Development by MWI or its successors or assigns to the Land or any portion thereof. The Parties agree to support the formation of the other Party's Districts as provided for in this Agreement, and to work to resolve any issues raised by potentially overlapping Districts, mill levy caps, and other limitations so that each Party can have established the Districts anticipated by this Agreement.
