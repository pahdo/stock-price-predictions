NOTES TO THE CONDENSED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND JUNE 30, 2016 AND

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015

Note 1    NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Green Meadow Products, Inc. ("the Company", "GMP", "we", "us" or "our") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on June 22, 2012.

The Company initially acquired a product for trucking fleets on December 20, 2012. Subsequently on April 18, 2013, we made the decision to take the business in a different direction and sold the product for the trucking fleets at a loss. The Company's current focus is on the sales of licensing rights to our Green Meadow PR formula and the manufacturing and sales of our Green Meadow PR formula as well as the manufacturing and sales of our PawPal product and our recently acquired stress relief formula.

Note 2 -  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follows.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. They do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the period presented have been included in the interim period. The operating results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year ending June 30, 2016 or for any future period.

These unaudited condensed financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June30, 2016.

ESTIMATES

The preparation of the financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

7 

CUSTOMER AND PURCHASE CONCENTRATION

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 we had $7,100 in sales to Sandstone Enterprises for a sub license agreement for a dog treat formula which equates to 100% of sales for the quarter. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015 we had $5,000 in sales to one customer for licensing rights which equates to 60% of sales for the quarter, and swap meet sales for $3,360 which equates to 40% of sales for the quarter.

NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK

The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 105, "Earnings per Share" which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

The Company has no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued and outstanding during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.   

REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, "Revenue Recognition" ("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.

The Company's revenues have been generated primarily through sublicense and distribution agreements related to our Paw Pal product and our pain relief products. The terms of these agreements generally consist solely of upfront, nonrefundable payments for licensing and distribution rights. Revenues from non-refundable licensing and distribution fees are recognized upon the completion of delivery of the license agreement and invoice to the customer and/or receipt of the payment if the license has stand-alone value and we do not have ongoing involvement or obligations. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial condition or the results of its operations other than in respect of the early adoption of the new regulations relating to Development Stage Entities as discussed above.

Note 3  GOING CONCERN

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.   As at September 30, 2016 the Company had yet to establish a proven, reliable, recurring source of revenue to fund its ongoing operating costs and with insufficient funds to fully implement its proposed business plan.   This raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

8 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. The Company is contemplating conducting an offering of its debt or equity securities to obtain additional operating capital. The Company is dependent upon its ability, and will continue to attempt, to secure equity and/or debt financing. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.

Note 4 - INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences for the periods presented are as follows:

For the three month period ended September 30, 2016, we did not recognize a tax expense.

For the three month period ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a tax credit of $871 in respect of tax losses generated in the period that were available to carry back and generate a tax refund in respect of taxable profits generated in the prior year. .

Note 5   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has reviewed events between September 30, 2016 to the date that the financials were issued, and there were no significant events identified for disclosure.

ITEM 2.      Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

GENERAL

Green Meadow Products, Inc. ("the Company", "GMP", "we", "us" or "our") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on June 22, 2012. 

The Company initially acquired a product for trucking fleets which it sold at a loss in order to focus on the pet product business. The Company now operates in the pet natural health supplement and related fields; with a focus on natural pet pain relief formulas and pet pain preventative products. We believe it will be able to successfully compete in today's natural supplement and related fields industry by controlling production costs and by limiting its distribution expenses using, primarily, online marketing tools to promote its products and to further develop its digital strategies.

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, "Revenue Recognition" ("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectibility of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.

The Company's revenues have been generated primarily through sublicense and distribution agreements related to our Paw Pal product and our pain relief products. The terms of these agreements generally consist solely of upfront, nonrefundable payments for licensing and distribution rights. Revenues from non-refundable licensing and distribution fees are recognized upon the completion of delivery of the license agreement and invoice to the customer and/or receipt of the payment if the license has stand-alone value and we do not have ongoing involvement or obligations. 

For the year ended June 30, 2016 and the three month period ended September 30, 2016, all license payments met the above criteria or in the case of one contract, the only continuing involvement was to sell our products to the distributor at pricing that is consistent with market transactions, thereby allowing for the recognition of revenue for the licensing and distribution arrangements upon receipt. 

When non-refundable license fees do not meet this criteria, the license revenues are recognized over the expected period of performance. We periodically review for any expected period of substantial involvement under the agreements that provide for non-refundable up-front payments and license fees. If ever applicable, we will adjust the amortization periods when appropriate to reflect changes in assumptions relating to the duration of our expected involvement.

10 

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 we had $7,100 in sales to Sandstone Enterprises for a sub license agreement for a dog treat formula which equates to 100% of sales for the quarter.

For the three month period ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $(4,937) due to the factors discussed above.

As at September 30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand of $3,474, total assets of $26,277, total liabilities of $7,500 and stockholders' equity of $18,777 as compared to September 30, 2015, where the Company had cash on hand of $28,372, total assets of $49,023, total liabilities of $330 and stockholders' equity of $48,693.

Financing Activities

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we neither generated nor used any funds in financing activities.

Our auditor's report states the following with regard to our ability to continue as a going concern, "has yet to establish a reliable, consistent and proven source of revenue to meet its operating costs on an ongoing basis and currently does not have sufficient available funding to fully implement its business plan. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern".

The Company believes it may have sufficient cash resources available to fund its primary operation for the next twelve (12) months. The Company has no agreements in place with its shareholders, officer and director or with any third parties to fund operations beyond the end of the Company's September 30, 2016 quarter. The Company has not negotiated nor has available to it any other third party sources of liquidity.

The Company has no, current, off balance sheet arrangements and does not anticipate entering into any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition.
