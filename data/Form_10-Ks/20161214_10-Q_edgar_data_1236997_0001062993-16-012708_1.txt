CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    October 31, 2016
  (Unaudited)   

Note 1   
     
         Nature of Operations      

CounterPath Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated
      in the State of Nevada on April 18, 2003. The shares of the Company s
      common stock are listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market in the
      United States of America and on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada.

The Company focuses on the design, development, marketing
      and sales of software applications and related services, such as pre and
      post sales technical support and customization services, that enable
      enterprises and telecommunication service providers to deliver Unified
      Communications (UC) services, including voice, video, messaging and
      collaboration functionality, over their Internet Protocol, or IP, based
      networks. The Company s products are sold either directly or through
      channel partners, to small, medium and large businesses ( enterprises )
      and telecom service providers, in North America, and in Europe, Middle
      East, Africa ( collectively EMEA ), Asia Pacific and Latin America.

Note 2   
     
         Significant Accounting Policies      

These interim consolidated financial statements have been
      prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
      the United States of America and are stated in U.S. dollars except where
      otherwise disclosed. Because a precise determination of many assets and
      liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial
      statements for the period necessarily involves the use of estimates, which
      have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these
      estimates.    

These interim consolidated financial statements have been
      prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue
      to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the
      normal course of business. In the current period, service revenue was
      separated into two categories, professional and other services and
      subscription, support and maintenance revenue. The comparative period has
      been adjusted to conform to the current period s presentation (Note 2(g)).

a)  
     
        Basis of Presentation    

These interim consolidated financial statements include
      the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, CounterPath
      Technologies Inc. ( CounterPath Technologies ), a company existing under
      the laws of the province of British Columbia, Canada, and BridgePort
      Networks, Inc. ( BridgePort ), incorporated under the laws of the state of
      Delaware. All inter- company transactions and balances have been
      eliminated.

       Significant Accounting
      Policies - (cont d)       

b)  
     
        Interim Reporting    

The information presented in the accompanying interim
      consolidated financial statements is without audit pursuant to the rules
      and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
      information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial
      statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
      regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are
      adequate to make the information presented not misleading.   

These statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in
      the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial
      position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods
      presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
      the United States of America. Except where noted, these interim financial
      statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of their
      application as the Company s April 30, 2016 annual audited consolidated
      financial statements. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. It
      is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in
      conjunction with the Company s April 30, 2016 annual audited consolidated
      financial statements.   

Operating results for the six months ended October 31,
      2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected
      for the year ending April 30, 2017.

        New Accounting Pronouncements    

In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue From
      Contracts With Customers  ( Topic 606 ). Topic 606 removes
      inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements, provides a more
      robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improves comparability of
      revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions
      and capital markets, provides more useful information to users of
      financial statements through improved disclosure requirements and
      simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number
      of requirements to which an entity must refer. The guidance in this update
      supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue
      Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry
      Topics of the Codification. In August 2015, ASU 2015-14 was issued which
      delayed the effective date for public entities to reporting periods
      beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The
      Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new
      standard.   

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from
      Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
      Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the guidance in the new revenue
      standard on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a
      revenue transaction. This conclusion impacts whether an entity reports
      revenue on a gross or net basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of
      this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related
      disclosures.   

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from
      Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and
      Licensing, which clarifies the guidance in the new revenue standard
      regarding an entity s identification of its performance obligations in a
      contract, as well as an entity s evaluation of the nature of its promise
      to grant a license of intellectual property and whether or not that
      revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time. We are currently
      evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial
      Statements and related disclosures.

      Policies       (cont d)

        New Accounting Pronouncements   (cont d)    

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue
      Recognition: Customer Payments and Incentives, which clarifies the
      guidance in recognizing costs for consideration given by a vendor to a
      customer as a component of cost of sales. We are currently evaluating the
      impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements and
      related disclosures.   

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from
      Contracts with Customers: Narrow- Scope Improvements and Practical
      Expedients which amends the guidance in the new revenue standard on
      collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and
      transition. The amendments are intended to address implementation issues
      and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and
      complexity of applying the new revenue standard. These amendments have the
      same effective date as the new revenue standard. While we are currently
      evaluating the method of adoption and the impact of the new revenue
      standard, as amended, on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related
      disclosures, we believe the adoption of the new standard may have a
      significant impact on the accounting for certain transactions with
      multiple elements or  bundled  arrangements because the requirement to
      have VSOE for undelivered elements under current accounting standards is
      eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, we may be required to
      recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the
      software, as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire
      sales price ratably over an estimated offering period. We continue to
      evaluate the impact of the new revenue standard on our Consolidated
      Financial Statements and related disclosures.   

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial
      Instruments: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which
      amends the guidance on measuring credit losses on financial assets held at
      amortized cost. The amendment is intended to address the issue that the
      previous  incurred loss  methodology was restrictive for Company s ability
      to record credit losses based on not yet meeting the  probable  threshold.
      The new language will require these assets to be valued at amortized cost
      presented at the net amount expected to be collected will a valuation
      provision. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning
      after December 15, 2019. We are evaluating the impact of this amendment on
      our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   

In August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation
      of Financial Statements   Going Concern , which requires management to
      evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to
      continue as a going concern and provide related footnote disclosures. The
      guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning
      on or after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial
      statements that have not been previously issued. The standard allows for
      either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method.
      The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on the
      Company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.   

In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases .
      The guidance would require lessees to recognize most leases on their
      balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right  of-use
      assets. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods
      beginning on or after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently
      evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its
      consolidated financial statements.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    October 31, 2016

Note 2   
       Significant Accounting
      Policies       (cont d)      

d)  
     
        Derivative Instruments    

The Company accounts for derivative instruments,
      consisting of foreign currency forward contracts, pursuant to the
      provisions of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ). ASC 815
      requires the Company to measure derivative instruments at fair value and
      record them in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and
      expands financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging
      activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better
      understand their effects on an entity s financial position, results of
      operations and cash flows. The Company does not use derivative instruments
      for trading purposes. ASC 815 also requires qualitative disclosures about
      objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures
      about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative
      instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features
      in derivative agreements.   

The Company also routinely enters into foreign currency
      forward contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to protect the
      Company from fluctuations in exchange rates. Gains or losses arising out
      of marked to market fair value valuation of forward contracts, not
      designated as hedges, are recognized in net income (see Note 4).   

The Company records foreign currency forward contracts on
      its Consolidated Balance Sheets as derivative instruments assets or
      liabilities depending on whether the net fair value of such contracts is a
      net asset or net liability, respectively (see Note 4  Derivative Financial
      Instruments and Risk Management,  of the Notes to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements). The Company did not enter any foreign currency
      derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in the three and six months
      ended October 31, 2016.   

e)  
     
        Goodwill    

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the
      estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date.
      ASC Topic 350 ( ASC 350 ) requires goodwill to be tested for impairment
      annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change
      that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company's
      business enterprise below its carrying value. These events or
      circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate,
      legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or
      disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Recoverability
      of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the
      reporting unit s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of
      the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors,
      market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash
      flow analysis.   

Management has determined that the Company currently has
      a single reporting unit which is CounterPath Corporation. If the recorded
      value of the assets, including goodwill, and liabilities ( net book
      value ) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss
      may be required.   

Goodwill of $6,339,717 (CDN$6,704,947) and $2,083,960
      (CDN$2,083,752) was initially recorded as the Company was deemed to be the
      acquirer of NewHeights Software Corporation ( NewHeights ) on August 2,
      2007 and FirstHand Technologies Inc. ( FirstHand ) on February 1, 2008,
      respectively. Translated to U.S. dollars using the period end rate, the
      goodwill balance at October 31, 2016 was $5,002,423 (CDN$6,704,947) (April
      30, 2016 - $5,341,481) in respect of NewHeights and $1,554,392

f)  
     
        Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
      Accounts    

Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for
      doubtful accounts.     

The Company determines the allowance for doubtful
      accounts by considering a number of factors, including the length of time
      the accounts receivable are beyond the contractual payment terms, previous
      loss history, and the customer s current ability to pay its obligation.
      When the Company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet
      its financial obligations to the Company, the Company records a charge to
      the allowance to reduce the customer s related accounts.   

g)  
     
        Revenue Recognition    

The Company s revenue is generated from the sale of
      software license, subscription fees related to the cloud offering, support
      and maintenance services and professional services. The Company recognizes
      revenue in accordance with ASC 985-605  Software Revenue
    Recognition .   

Software license revenue is recognized for sales of
      perpetual licenses.   

Subscription, support and maintenance revenue is
      generated from recurring fees purchased through the Company s cloud based
      offerings, where the customer has no right to take possession of the
      underlying software at any time.   

Professional and other services includes software
      customization, implementation, training, and dedicated engineering which
      are recognized as the related service has been performed.   

h)  
     
        Earnings Per Share    

The Company computes net loss per share in accordance
      with ASC Topics 260 and ASC 260-10. ASC Topics 260 requires presentation
      of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) on the face of the
      consolidated statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing
      net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
      of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS gives effect to
      all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the year including
      stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method. In computing
      diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining
      the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock
      options or warrants. For the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015,
      common share equivalents, consisting of common shares issuable, on
      exercise or settlement, as applicable, of options, warrants and deferred
      share units ( DSUs ) of 923,102 and 840,854, respectively, were not
      included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect was
      anti-dilutive.

       Related Party
      Transactions     

During the three and six months ended October 31, 2016,
      the Company through its wholly owned subsidiary, CounterPath Technologies,
      paid $19,271 and $38,541 (2015 - $19,746 and $39,493) to Kanata Research
      Park Corporation ( KRP ) for leased office space. KRP is controlled by the
      Chairman of the Company.    

On November 21, 2013, the Company, through its wholly
      owned subsidiary, CounterPath Technologies, entered into an agreement with
      8007004 (Canada) Inc. ( 8007004 ) to lease office space. 8007004 is
      controlled by a member of the board of directors of the Company.
      CounterPath Technologies, paid $7,520 and $14,878 (2015 - $nil and $nil)
      for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016.    

On July 31, 2015, the Company sold products and services
      to Magor Corporation for consideration of $134,250. Magor Corporation s
      chairman of the board is also Chairman of the Company.    

The above transactions are in the normal course of
      operations and are recorded at amounts established and agreed to between
      the related parties.    

Note 4   
     
         Derivative Financial Instruments and Risk
      Management      

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed
      to fluctuations in the exchange rates associated with foreign currencies.
      The Company s primary objective for holding derivative financial
      instruments is to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.    

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk     

A majority of the Company s revenue activities are
      transacted in U.S. dollars. However, the Company is exposed to foreign
      currency exchange rate risk inherent in conducting business globally in
      numerous currencies, of which the most significant to the Company s
      operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 is the
      Canadian dollar as a majority of the Company s expenses are in Canadian
      dollars. The Company s foreign currency risk management program includes
      foreign currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation
      that utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exposures to the
      variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S.
      dollar-denominated cash flows. During the three and six months ended
      October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not enter into any cash flow
      hedges.    

The Company also routinely enters into foreign currency
      forward contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to protect it
      from fluctuations in exchange rates. During the three and six months ended
      October 31, 2016, the Company had not entered into any foreign currency
      forward contracts. On June 7, 2015, the Company entered into a $1,000,000
      notional value foreign currency forward contract that matured on August
      20, 2015. A loss of $nil (2015 - $8,075 and $47,690) was recognized during
      the three and six month period.

Fair Value Measurement     

When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to
      determine fair value, and classifies such measurements within Level 1. In
      some cases where market prices are not available, the Company makes use of
      observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the
      measurements are classified within Level 2. If quoted or observable market
      prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed
      models that use, where possible, current market based parameters such as
      interest rates, yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are
      classified within Level 3.    

Fair value measurements are classified according to the
      lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. A
      measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there
      may be significant inputs that are readily observable.    

Fair value measurement includes the consideration of
      non performance risk. Non performance risk refers to the risk that an
      obligation (either by a counterparty or the Company) will not be
      fulfilled. For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1), the
      non performance risk is included in the market price. For certain other
      financial assets and liabilities (Level 2 and 3), the Company s fair value
      calculations have been adjusted accordingly.    

The following table presents the Company s assets and
      liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
      October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016.

Note 5   
       Common Stock     

On April 4, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement
      to issue 25,000 shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for
      advisory services which was subsequently amended to 23,500 shares. The
      shares were issued in three tranches: (i) the first tranche of 10,000
      shares was issued on April 22, 2016; (ii) the second tranche of 10,000
      shares was issued on May 25, 2016; (iii) and the third tranche of 3,500
      shares was issued on June 30, 2016.    

The Company has a stock option plan (the  2010 Stock
      Option Plan ) under which options to purchase shares of the Company s
      common stock may be granted to employees, directors and consultants. Stock
      options entitle the holder to purchase shares of the Company s common
      stock at an exercise price determined by the board of directors (the
       Board ) of the Company at the time of the grant. The options generally
      vest in the amount of 12.5% on the date which is six months from the date
      of grant and then beginning in the seventh month at 1/42 per month for 42
      months, at which time the options are fully vested.    

On September 12, 2016, the maximum number of shares of
      common stock authorized by the Company s stock holders and reserved for
      issuance by the Board under the 2010 Stock Option Plan was increased from
      786,000 to 986,000.    

On September 12, 2016, the decrease in the exercise price
      of certain outstanding stock options to $2.50 was authorized by the
      Company s stock holders. Accordingly the exercise price of 319,822 stock
      options with exercise prices ranging from $4.50 to $29.00 was decreased to
      $2.50. The fair value of the options immediately prior to the modification
      was compared to the fair value of the modified options. Stock based
      compensation of $112,158 was recognized on the modification of the vested
      options.    

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model
      to determine the fair value of stock options granted. Assumptions used to
      determine the fair value of the modified options were a volatility of
      88.55%, dividend yield of 0%, a risk free rate of 1.23% and an expected
      life dependent on the remaining life of the specific stock options based
      on an expected life of 3.7 years at grant date. The Company applied an
      estimated forfeiture rate of 15% for the six months ended October 31, 2016
      and 2015 in determining the expense recorded in the accompanying
      consolidated statement of operations.    

For the majority of the stock options granted, the number
      of shares issued on the date the stock options are exercised is net of the
      minimum statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays in cash
      to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of its employees. Although
      these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock
      repurchases under our authorized plan they are treated as common stock
      repurchases in our consolidated financial statements, as they reduce the
      number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting.    

The weighted-average fair value of options granted during
      the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 was $nil and $1.55,
      respectively (2015 - $nil and $3.10). The weighted-average assumptions
      utilized to determine such values are presented in the following table:

Employee Stock Purchase
      Plan    

Under the terms of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
       ESPP ) all regular salaried (non- probationary) employees can purchase up
      to 6% of their base salary in shares of the Company s common stock at
      market price. The Company will match 50% of the shares purchased by
      issuing or purchasing in the market up to 3% of the respective employee s
      base salary in shares. During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the
      Company matched $18,197 (2015 - $22,065) in shares purchased by employees
      under the ESPP. During the six months ended October 31, 2016, 24,481
      shares (2015   no shares) were purchased on the open market and no shares
      (2015   13,869 shares) were issued from treasury under the ESPP.

A total of 120,000 shares have been reserved for issuance
      under the ESPP. As of October 31, 2016, a total of 86,203 shares were
      available for issuance under the ESPP.    

Normal Course Issuer Bid Plan     

Pursuant to a normal course issuer bid ( NCIB )
      commencing on March 19, 2016 and expiring March 18, 2017, the Company is
      authorized to purchase 273,864 shares of the Company s common stock
      through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the  TSX ) and other
      Canadian marketplaces or U.S. marketplaces. During the period from March
      19, 2015 to March 18, 2016, the Company repurchased 11,360 shares at an
      average price of $3.80 (CDN$4.97) for a total of $43,168 and during the
      period March 19, 2016 to October 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 2,900
      common shares at an average price of $2.16 (CDN$2.81) for a total of
      $6,264. As of October 31, 2016, a total of 78,008 shares have been
      cancelled and the remaining 600 repurchased shares are in the process of
      being cancelled since the NCIB was initiated.    

Deferred Share Unit Plan     

Under the terms of the Deferred Share Unit Plan (the
       DSUP ), each DSU is equivalent to one share of the Company s common
      stock. The maximum number of common shares that may be reserved for
      issuance to any one participant pursuant to DSUs granted under the DSUP
      and any share compensation arrangement is 5% of the number of shares
      outstanding at the time of reservation. A DSU granted to a participant who
      is a director of the Company shall vest immediately on the award date. A
      DSU granted to a participant other than a director will generally vest as
      to one-third (1/3) of the number of DSUs granted on the first, second and
      third anniversaries of the award date. Fair value of the DSUs, which is
      based on the closing price of the shares of the Company s common stock on
      the date of grant, is recorded as compensation expense over the vesting
      period.    

On September 12, 2016, the maximum number of shares of
      common stock authorized by the Company s stockholders reserved for
      issuance under the DSUP was increased from 400,000 shares to 500,000
      shares. During the six months ended October 31, 2016, 90,453 (2015  
      55,034) DSUs were issued under the DSUP, of which 24,228 were granted to
      officers or employees and 66,225 were granted to non-employee directors.
      As of October 31, 2016, a total of 130,595 shares were available for
      issuance under the DSUP.

   Background    
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 18,
2003. 
 On
August 2, 2007, we acquired all of the shares of NewHeights Software Corporation
through the issuance of 768,017 shares of our common stock and 36,984 preferred
shares issued from a subsidiary of our company, which preferred shares were
exchangeable into 36,984 shares of our common stock.  
 23  

On
February 1, 2008, we acquired all of the shares of FirstHand Technologies Inc.
through the issuance of 590,000 shares of our common stock. On February 1, 2008,
we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of BridgePort Networks,
Inc. ( BridgePort Networks ) by way of merger in consideration for the
assumption of all of the assets and liabilities of BridgePort Networks.  
   
   Business of CounterPath   
 We
design, develop and sell software and services that enable enterprises and
telecommunication service providers to deliver Unified Communications (UC)
services, including voice, video, messaging and collaboration functionality,
over their Internet Protocol, or IP, based networks. We are capitalizing upon
numerous industry trends, including the rapid adoption of mobile technology, the
proliferation of bring-your-own-device to work programs, the need for secure
business communications, the need for centralized provisioning, the migration
towards cloud-based services and the migration towards all IP networks. We are
also capitalizing on a trend where communication services such as Skype and
WhatsApp are becoming more available over-the-top (OTT) of the incumbent
operators  networks or enterprise networks (a.k.a. Internet OTT providers). We
offer our solutions under perpetual license agreements that generate one-time
license revenue and under subscription license agreements that generate
recurring license revenue. We sell our solutions through our own online store,
through third-party online stores, directly using our in-house sales team and
through channel partners. Our channel partners include original equipment
manufacturers, value added distributers and value added resellers. Enterprises
typically leverage our Enterprise OTT solutions to increase employee
productivity and to reduce certain costs. Telecommunication service providers
typically deploy our Operator OTT solutions as part of a broad strategy to
defend their subscriber base from competitive threats by offering innovative new
services. Our original equipment manufacturers and value added resellers
typically integrate our solutions into their products and then sell a bundled
solution to their end customers, which include both telecommunication service
providers and enterprises.  
   Revenue    
 Our
total revenue consists of the following:  

Software    

We generate software revenue primarily on a single fee
      per perpetual software license basis. We recognize software revenue at the
      time of delivery, provided all revenue recognition criteria have been met.
      If the revenue recognition criteria has not been met, the revenue is
      deferred. The number of software licenses purchased has a direct impact on
      the average selling price. Our software revenue may vary significantly
      from quarter to quarter as a result of long sales and deployment cycles,
      new product introductions and variations in customer ordering practices.         

Subscription, support and maintenance     

We generate recurring subscription revenue from
      subscriptions related to our software as a service offering. Recurring
      support and maintenance revenue is generated from annual software support
      and maintenance contracts for our perpetual software licenses. Both
      subscription revenue and support and maintenance revenue are typically
  billed annually in advance based on the terms of the arrangement.     

Support services include e-mail and telephone support,
      unspecified rights to bug fixes and product updates and upgrades and
      enhancements available on a when-and-if available basis, and are
      recognized rateably over the term of the service period, which is
      generally twelve months.    

Professional services and other     

We generate professional services and other revenue
      through services including product configuration and customization,
      implementation, dedicated engineering and training. The amount of product
      configuration and customization required by a customer typically increases
      as the order size increases from a given customer. Services and pricing may
vary depending upon a customer's requirements for customization, implementation
and training.     
 24  

Operating Expenses    
 Operating
expenses consist of cost of sales, sales and marketing, research and
development, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel-related costs
are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. 
 Cost
of sales primarily consists of: (a) salaries and benefits related to personnel,
(b) related overhead, (c) billable and non-billable travel, lodging, and other
out-of-pocket expenses, (d) payments to third party vendors for
compression/decompression software known as codecs, (e) amortization of
capitalized software that is implemented into our products and (f) warranty
expense. 
 Sales
and marketing expense consists primarily of: (a) salaries and related personnel
costs including stock-based compensation, (b) commissions, (c) travel, lodging
and other out-of-pocket expenses, (d) marketing programs such as trade shows and
(e) other related overhead. Commissions are recorded as an expense when earned
by the employee. We expect increases in sales and marketing expense for the
foreseeable future as we further increase the number of sales professionals and
increase our marketing activities with the intent to grow our revenue. We expect
sales and marketing expense to decrease as a percentage of total revenue,
however, as we leverage our current sales and marketing personnel as well as our
distribution partnerships.  
 Research
and development expense consists primarily of: (a) salaries and related
personnel costs including stock-based compensation, (b) payments to contractors
for design and consulting services, (c) costs relating to the design and
development of new products and enhancement of existing products, (d) quality
assurance and testing and (e) other related overhead. To date, all of our
research and development costs have been expensed as incurred.  
 General
and administrative expense consists primarily of: (a) salaries and personnel
costs including stock-based compensation related to our executive, finance,
human resource and information technology functions, (b) accounting, legal, tax
advisory and regulatory fees and (c) other related overhead.  
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
Estimates   
 Our
interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our
estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ
significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
There have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented
in this quarterly report.  
 We
believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following accounting
policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, the
following policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and
evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.  
   Basis of Presentation    
 The
interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company
and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, CounterPath Technologies, a company existing
under the laws of the province of British Columbia, Canada, and BridgePort
Networks, a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware. All
inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.  
 25  

Interim Reporting    
 The
information presented in the accompanying interim consolidated financial
statements is without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the interim
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  
 These
statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management,
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for the interim periods presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States. Except where noted, the
interim consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting policies
and methods of their application as our April 30, 2016 annual audited
consolidated financial statements. All adjustments are of a normal recurring
nature. It is suggested that these interim consolidated financial statements be
read in conjunction with our April 30, 2016 annual audited consolidated
financial statements.  
 Operating
results for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that can be expected for the year ending April 30,
2017.  
   Revenue Recognition    
 We
recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 985-605 "Software Revenue Recognition". 
 In
all of our arrangements, we do not recognize any revenue until we can determine
that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the
fee is fixed or determinable, and we deem collection to be probable. For
distribution and reseller arrangements, fees are fixed or determinable and
collection probable when there are no rights to exchange or return and fees are
not dependable upon payment from the end-user. If any of these criteria are not
met, revenue is deferred until such time that all criteria have been met. 
 A
substantial percentage of our revenue is generated by multiple-element
arrangements, such as products, support and maintenance, and professional
services. When arrangements include multiple elements, we allocate the total fee
among the various elements using the residual method. Under the residual method,
revenue is recognized when vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair
value exists for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement, but does
not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the arrangement. Each
arrangement requires us to analyze the individual elements in the transaction
and to estimate the fair value of each undelivered element, which typically
includes maintenance and services. Revenue is allocated to each of the
undelivered elements based on its respective fair value, with the fair value
determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately. Revenue
from multiple-element arrangements are recognized in software, subscription,
support and maintenance, and professional services based on the items or
services delivered. 
 For
contracts with elements related to customized network solutions and certain
network build-outs, we apply FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue ASC 605-25,
"Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables" and revenues are recognized
under ASC 605-35, "Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts", generally using the percentage-of-completion method. 
 In
using the percentage-of-completion method, revenues are generally recorded based
on a completion of milestones as described in the agreement. Profit estimates on
long-term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances
and any losses on contracts are recognized in the period that such losses become
known. 
 Post
contract customer support (PCS) services include e-mail and telephone support,
unspecified rights to bug fixes and product updates and upgrades and
enhancements available on a when-and-if available basis, and are recognized
rateably over the term of the service period, which is generally twelve months.
PCS service revenue generally is deferred until the related product has been
delivered and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. PCS revenues
are recognized under support and maintenance revenues.  
 26  

Professional
services and training revenue is recognized as the related service is performed. 
   Stock-Based Compensation    
 Stock
options granted are accounted for under ASC 718,  Share-Based Payment , and
are recognized at the fair value of the options as determined by an option
pricing model as the related services are provided and the options earned. ASC
718 requires public companies to recognize the cost of employee services
received in exchange for equity instruments, based on the fair value of those
instruments on the measurement date which generally is the grant date, with
limited exceptions. 
 Stock-based
compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to
employees and non-employee consultants. We measure stock-based compensation cost
at measurement date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and
generally recognize the cost as expense on a straight-line basis (net of
estimated forfeitures) over the employee requisite service period or the period
during which the related services are provided by the non-employee consultants
and the options are earned. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a
Black-Scholes option valuation model.  
 The
expected volatility of options granted has been determined using the volatility
of our company's stock. The expected life of options granted after April 30,
2006 has been determined based on analysis of historical data. We have not paid
and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock;
therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero. In addition, ASC
718 requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating
the expense for the period. We applied an estimated forfeiture rate of 15.0% for
the six months ended October 31, 2016 in determining the expense recorded in our
consolidated statement of operations. Cost of sales and operating expenses
include stock-based compensation expense, and deferred share unit plan expense.
For the six months ended October 31, 2016, we recorded an expense of $565,156 in
connection with share-based payment awards. A future expense of non-vested
options of $596,390 is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 2.08 years. A future expense of non-vested deferred share units of $175,195
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.71 years.  
   Research and Development Expense for Software Products
   
 Research
and development expense includes costs incurred to develop intellectual
property. The costs for the development of new software and substantial
enhancements to existing software are expensed as incurred until technological
feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be
capitalized. We have determined that technological feasibility is established at
the time a working model of software is completed. Because we believe our
current process for developing software will be essentially completed
concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, no costs have
been capitalized to date. 
   Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
   
 We
extend credit to our customers based on evaluation of an individual customer's
financial condition and collateral is generally not required. Accounts
outstanding beyond the contractual payment terms are considered past due. We
determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by considering a number of
factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are beyond the
contractual payment terms, our previous loss history, and a customer's current
ability to pay its obligation to us. We write-off accounts receivable when they
are identified as uncollectible. All outstanding accounts receivable are
periodically reviewed for collectability on an individual basis. 
   Goodwill   
 We
have goodwill related to the acquisitions of NewHeights Software Corporation and
FirstHand Technologies Inc. The determination of the net carrying value of
goodwill and the extent to which, if any, there is impairment, are dependent on
material estimates and judgments on our part, including the estimate of the
value of future net cash flows, which are based upon further estimates of future
revenues, expenses and operating margins.  
 27  

Goodwill Impairment Assessments    
   
 We
review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance
with FASB ASC 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . The provisions
of ASC 350 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In
the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying
value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the
net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are
not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets
assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit,
then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to
determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill. If the
carrying value of our reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value,
then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.  
 Determining
the fair value of our reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates
and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include future economic and
market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base
our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are
unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from
those estimates. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was
performed at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, did not result in an
impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment for the three and
six months ending October 31, 2016.  
   Derivative Instruments    
 We
periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts, not designated as
hedging instruments, to protect us from fluctuations in exchange rates. As at
October 31, 2016, our company had no foreign currency forward contracts
outstanding. On June 7, 2015, we entered into a $1,000,000 notional value
foreign currency forward contract that matured on August 20, 2015. The fair
value marked to market loss of forward contracts for that foreign currency
contract for the three and six months ended October 31, 2015 was $8,075 and
$47,690, respectively. Notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets
or liabilities of our company, but are used in the calculation of cash
settlements under the contracts. 
   Use of Estimates    
 The
preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires our management to make
estimates and assumptions which affect the amounts reported in our interim
consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto, and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  Results of Operations  
 Our
operating activities during the six months ended October 31, 2016 consisted
primarily of selling our IP telephony software and related services to telecom
service providers, enterprises and channel partners serving the telecom and
enterprise segments, and the continued development of our IP telephony software
products.  
 We
generate our revenue primarily in U.S. dollars and incur a majority of our
expenses in Canadian dollars. As a result of the decline in the Canadian dollar
against the U.S. dollar over the six months ended October 31, 2016, we benefited
by recording reduced operating costs on translation of Canadian dollar costs as
compared to the six months ended October 31, 2015. For the six months ended
October 31, 2016 as compared to six months ended October 31, 2015, the foreign
exchange benefit resulting from the decline in the Canadian dollar was
approximately $67,000.

increase in general and administrative expense was offset by a decrease in
amortization expense of approximately $68,000, and a decrease in investor
relations expenses of approximately $33,000. 
   Interest and Other Income    
 Interest
income for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 was $173 and $186,
respectively compared to $1,472 and $2,774, respectively, for the three and six
months ended October 31, 2015. Interest expense for the three and six months
ended October 31, 2016 was $nil for both periods, compared to $454 and $2,085,
respectively, for the three and six months ended October 31, 2015.  
 Foreign
exchange gain (loss) for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 was
$171,904 and $381,103, respectively, compared to $61,835 and $527,211,
respectively, for the three and six months ended October 31, 2015. The foreign
exchange gain (loss) represents the gain (loss) on account of translation of the
intercompany accounts of our subsidiary which maintains their records in
Canadian dollars and transactional gains and losses. The foreign exchange gain
(loss) includes the translation of quarterly intercompany transfer pricing
invoices from our Canadian subsidiary to us.  
 Fair
value adjustment on derivative instruments for the three and six months ended
October 31, 2016 resulted in a non-cash loss of $nil for both periods, compared
$8,075 and $47,690, respectively, for the three and six months ended October 31,
2015.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 As
of October 31, 2016, we had $1,919,765 in cash and cash equivalents compared to
$2,159,738 as of April 30, 2016, representing a decrease of $239,973. Our
working capital was $949,357 at October 31, 2016 compared to $1,737,956 at April
30, 2016, representing a decrease of $788,599. Management anticipates that the
future capital requirements of our company will be primarily funded through cash
flows generated from operations and from working capital, and we may seek
additional funding to meet ongoing operating expenses.  
 Our
company has $1,374,698 in cash held outside of the United States, and there is
no intent to repatriate at this time. Should we decide to repatriate in the
future, taxes would need to be accrued and paid.  
   Operating Activities    
 Our
operating activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $149,966 for the six
months ended October 31, 2016. This compares to a net cash outflow of $1,159,180
for the same period last year representing a decrease of $1,009,214 in cash
outflow from operations compared to the same period last year. The net cash
outflow from operating activities for the six months ended October 31, 2016 was
primarily a result of a net loss of $927,931 and a non-cash foreign exchange
gain of $437,795. The net cash outflow was offset by stock based compensation of
$551,190, unearned revenue of $319,980 and accounts receivable of $219,239. 
 33  

Investing Activities    
 Investing
activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $61,540, for the six months ended
October 31, 2016 primarily for purchases of computer equipment and intangible
assets. This compares with a net cash outflow from investing activities of
$9,177 for the same period last year primarily for purchases of computer
equipment. At October 31, 2016, we did not have any material commitments for
future capital expenditures.  
   Financing Activities    
 Financing
activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $7,870 for the six months ended
October 31, 2016 compared to a net cash inflow of $1,480,456 for the six months
ended October 31, 2015. The net cash inflow for the six months ended October 31,
2015 was primarily a result of a non-brokered private placement under which we
issued 293,000 units at a price of $5.00 per unit raising $1,465,000. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We
do not have, and do not have any present plans to implement, any off-balance
sheet arrangements.  
  New Accounting Pronouncements   
 In
May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers ( Topic
606 ). Topic 606 removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements,
provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improves
comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries,
jurisdictions and capital markets, provides more useful information to users of
financial statements through improved disclosure requirements and simplifies the
preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to
which an entity must refer. The guidance in this update supersedes the revenue
recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most
industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
In August 2015, ASU 2015-14 was issued which delayed the effective date for
public entities to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early
adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of this new standard.  
 In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),
which clarifies the guidance in the new revenue standard on assessing whether an
entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction. This conclusion
impacts whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. We are
currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.  
 In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which clarifies the guidance
in the new revenue standard regarding an entity s identification of its
performance obligations in a contract, as well as an entity s evaluation of the
nature of its promise to grant a license of intellectual property and whether or
not that revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time. We are currently
evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures.  
 In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition: Customer Payments
and Incentives, which clarifies the guidance in recognizing costs for
consideration given by a vendor to a customer as a component of cost of sales.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.  
 In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients which amends the guidance in
the new revenue standard on collectability, noncash consideration, presentation
of sales tax, and transition. The amendments are intended to address
implementation issues and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the
cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard. These amendments have
the same effective date as the new revenue standard. While we are currently
evaluating the method of adoption and the impact of the new revenue standard, as
amended, on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, we
believe the adoption of the new standard may have a significant impact on the
accounting for certain transactions with multiple elements or  bundled 
arrangements because the requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements under
current accounting standards is eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, we may be required to
recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software,
as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price
ratably over an estimated offering period. We continue to evaluate the impact of
the new revenue standard on our consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.  
 34  

In
August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements  
Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there is
substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and
provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual and
interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. Early
adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously
issued. The standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified
retrospective transition method. We do not expect this standard to have a
material impact our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  
 In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The guidance would require
lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities
with corresponding right-of-use assets. The guidance is effective for annual and
interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018. We are
currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our
consolidated financial statements.  
 In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments: Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which amends the guidance on measuring
credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost. The amendment is
intended to address the issue that the previous  incurred loss  methodology was
restrictive for Company s ability to record credit losses based on not yet
meeting the  probable  threshold. The new language will require these assets to
be valued at amortized cost presented at the net amount expected to be collected
will a valuation provision. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2019. We are evaluating the impact of this
amendment on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
  Item

Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   
 Not
Applicable.  
  Item
4.          Controls and
Procedures.  
   Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or
submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and
communicated to management including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  
 In
connection with this quarterly report, as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our company's disclosure controls
and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with
the participation of our company's management, including our company's Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our
company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as
of October 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as at
the end of the period covered by this report.  
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
   
 There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the quarter ended October 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.  
 35  

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   
  Item 1.   Legal Proceedings.  
 None. 
  Item 1A.   Risk Factors.  
 Much
of the information included in this quarterly report includes or is based upon
estimates, projections or other  forward looking statements . Such forward
looking statements include any projections or estimates made by us and our
management in connection with our business operations. While these
forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are
made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of
our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from
any estimates, predictions, projections, assumption or other future performance
suggested herein.  
 Such
estimates, projections or other  forward looking statements  involve various
risks and uncertainties as outlined below. We caution the reader that important
factors in some cases have affected and, in the future, could materially affect
actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from the results
expressed in any such estimates, projections or other  forward looking
statements .  
  Risks Associated with our Business and Industry   
  Lack
of cash flow which may affect our ability to continue as a going
concern.  
 Presently,
our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet operating and capital
expenses. Our business plan calls for continued research and development of our
products and expansion of our market share. We will require additional financing
to fund working capital and pay for operating expenses and capital requirements
until we achieve a positive cash flow. However, our management projects that
under our current operating plan that sufficient cash is available to meet our
ongoing operating expenses and working capital requirements through January 31,
2018.  
 However,
there is no assurance that actual cash requirements will not exceed our
estimates. In particular, additional capital may be required in the event that: 

we incur delays and additional
      expenses as a result of technology failure;   

we are unable to create a
      substantial market for our products; or   

we incur any significant
      unanticipated expenses.    
 The
occurrence of any of the aforementioned events could adversely affect our
ability to meet our proposed business plans. 
 We
depend on a mix of revenues and outside capital to pay for the continued
development of our technology and the marketing of our products. Such outside
capital may include the sale of additional stock and/or commercial borrowing.
There can be no assurance that capital will continue to be available if
necessary to meet these continuing development costs or, if the capital is
available, that it will be on terms acceptable to us. Disruptions in financial
markets and challenging economic conditions have and may continue to affect our
ability to raise capital. The issuance of additional equity securities by us
would result in a dilution, possibly a significant dilution, in the equity
interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming
those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash
commitments.    
  Our
revenue, operating results and gross margin can fluctuate significantly and
unpredictably from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year, and we expect that
they will continue to do so, which could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results.   
 36  

The
rate at which our customers order our products, and the size of these orders,
are highly variable and difficult to predict. In the past, we have experienced
significant variability in our customer purchasing practices on a quarterly and
annual basis, and we expect that this variability will continue, as a result of
a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:  

demand for our products and the
      timing and size of customer orders;   

length of sales cycles, which may
      be extended by selling our products through channel partners;   

length of time of deployment of
      our products by our customers;   

customers  budgetary constraints;

competitive pressures; and   

general economic conditions.
     
 As
a result of this volatility in our customers  purchasing practices, our revenue
has historically fluctuated unpredictably on a quarterly and annual basis and we
expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Our budgeted expense levels
depend in part on our expectations of future revenue. Because any substantial
adjustment to expenses to account for lower levels of revenue is difficult and
takes time, if our revenue declines, our operating expenses and general overhead
would likely be high relative to revenue, which could have a material adverse
effect on our operating margin and operating results.  
  We
may be unable to predict subscription renewal rates and the impact these rates
may have on our future revenue and operating results.   
 Some
of our products and services are sold on a subscription basis that are generally
month-to-month or one year in length. Our customers have no obligation to renew
their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial
subscription period, and some customers elect not to renew. We cannot provide
assurance that our subscriptions will be renewed at the same or higher level of
service, for the same number of licenses or for the same duration of time, if at
all. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict
future customer renewal rates. Our customers  renewal rates may decline or
fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of
satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue to regularly add
features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our
subscription services, the prices of our services, the prices of services
offered by our competitors, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer
base, reductions in our customers  spending levels or declines in customer
activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets.
If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they
renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.  
  If
we are not able to manage our operating expenses, then our financial condition
may be adversely affected.  
 Operating
expenses of $3,487,210 exceeded revenue of $2,751,113 for the three months ended
October 31, 2016. Our ability to reach and maintain profitability is conditional
upon our ability to manage our operating expenses. There is a risk that we will
have to increase our operating expenses in the future. Factors that could cause
our operating expenses to increase include our determination to spend more on
sales and marketing in order to increase product sales or our determination that
more research and development expenditures are required in order to keep our
current software products competitive or in order to develop new products for
the market. To the extent that our operating expenses increase without a
corresponding increase in revenue, our financial condition would be adversely
impacted.  
 37  

We
face larger and better-financed competitors, which may affect our ability to
achieve or maintain profitability.   
 Management
is aware of similar products which compete directly with our products and some
of the companies developing these similar products are larger and
better-financed than us and may develop products superior to those of our
company. In addition to price competition, increased competition may result in
other aggressive business tactics from our competitors, such as:  

emphasizing their own size and perceived stability
      against our smaller size and narrower recognition;    

providing customers  one-stop shopping  options for the
      purchase of network equipment and application software;    

offering customers financing assistance;    

making early announcements of competing products and
      employing extensive marketing efforts; and    

asserting infringement of their intellectual property
      rights.     
 Such
competition may potentially adversely affect our profitability. 
  A
decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise
further working capital and adversely impact our operations.   
 A
prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction
in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise
capital, or a delisting from a stock exchange on which our common stock trades.
Because our operations have been partially financed through the sale of equity
securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be especially
detrimental to our liquidity and our continued operations. Any reduction in our
ability to raise equity capital in the future would force us to reallocate funds
from other planned uses and would have a significant negative effect on our
business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new products and
continue our current operations. If our stock price declines, there can be no
assurance that we can raise additional capital or generate funds from operations
sufficient to meet our obligations.  
 On
December 16, 2014, we received notice from NASDAQ that the closing bid price of
our shares for the last 30 consecutive business days no longer met the minimum
bid price requirement of $1.00 per share. 
 Effective
November 2, 2015, our company effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split of the
shares of our common stock. On November 16, 2015, we received notice from NASDAQ
that the closing bid price of our common stock has been $1.00 or greater for the
previous 30 consecutive business day s and that we had regained compliance with
listing rule 5550(a)(2). There can be no assurance that the closing bid price of
our common stock will not fall below the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00
per share.  
  The
majority of our directors and officers are located outside the United States,
with the result that it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the
United States any judgments obtained against us or some of our directors or
officers.   
 The
majority of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of
countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of such
persons' assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be
difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments
obtained against us or our officers or directors, including judgments predicated
upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States
or any state thereof. Consequently, investors may be effectively prevented from
pursuing remedies under United States federal securities laws against some of
our directors or officers.  
 38  

We
may in the future be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property
litigation that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition, as well as the continued viability of our
company.   
 We
may be unaware of filed patent applications and issued patents that could relate
to our products and services. Intellectual property litigation, if determined
against us, could:  

result in the loss of a substantial number of existing
      customers or prohibit the acquisition of new customers;    

cause us to lose access to key distribution channels;

result in substantial employee layoffs or risk the
      permanent loss of highly-valued employees;    

materially and adversely affect our brand in the market
      place and cause a substantial loss of goodwill;    

affect our ability to raise additional capital;

cause our stock price to decline significantly; and

lead to the bankruptcy or liquidation of our company.
        
 Parties
making claims of infringement may be able to obtain injunctive or other
equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our
products or services and could cause us to pay substantial royalties, licensing
fees or damages. The defense of any lawsuit could result in time-consuming and
expensive litigation, regardless of the merits of such claims.  
  We
could lose our competitive advantages if we are not able to protect any
proprietary technology and intellectual property rights against infringement,
and any related litigation could be time-consuming and costly.   
 Our
success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree on our
proprietary technology incorporated in our software. If any of our competitors'
copy or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology or develops similar
technologies independently, we would not be able to compete as effectively. We
also consider our family of registered and unregistered trademarks including
CounterPath, Bria, eyebeam, X-Lite, and Softphone.com invaluable to our ability
to continue to develop and maintain the goodwill and recognition associated with
our brand. The measures we take to protect the proprietary technology software,
and other intellectual property rights, which presently are based upon a
combination of patents, patents pending, copyright, trade secret and trademark
laws, may not be adequate to prevent their unauthorized use. Further, the laws
of foreign countries may provide inadequate protection of such intellectual
property rights.  
 We
may need to bring legal claims to enforce or protect such intellectual property
rights. Any litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in
substantial costs and divert resources from intended uses. In addition,
notwithstanding any rights we have secured in our intellectual property, other
persons may bring claims against us that we have infringed on their intellectual
property rights, including claims based upon the content we license from third
parties or claims that our intellectual property right interests are not valid.
Any claims against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and costly
to defend or litigate, divert our attention and resources, result in the loss of
goodwill associated with our service marks or require us to make changes to our
website or other of our technologies.  
  Our
products may become obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to respond
adequately to rapidly changing technology and customer demands.   
 Our
industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer demands.
As a result, our products may quickly become obsolete and unmarketable. Our
future success will depend on our ability to adapt to technological advances, anticipate customer demands, develop
new products and enhance our current products on a timely and cost-effective
basis. Further, our products must remain competitive with those of other
companies with substantially greater resources. We may experience technical or
other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or
marketing of new products or enhanced versions of existing products. Also, we
may not be able to adapt new or enhanced services to emerging industry
standards, and our new products may not be favorably received.  
 39  

Unless
we can establish broad market acceptance of our current products, our potential
revenues may be significantly reduced.   
 We
expect that a substantial portion of our future revenue will be derived from the
sale of our software products. We expect that these product offerings and their
extensions and derivatives will account for a majority of our revenue for the
foreseeable future. Broad market acceptance of our software products is,
therefore, critical to our future success and our ability to continue to
generate revenues. Failure to achieve broad market acceptance of our software
products as a result of competition, technological change, or otherwise, would
significantly harm our business. Our future financial performance will depend
primarily on the continued market acceptance of our current software product
offerings and on the development, introduction and market acceptance of any
future enhancements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
marketing our current product offerings or any new product offerings,
applications or enhancements, and any failure to do so would significantly harm
our business.  
  Our
use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to
commercialize our products.   
 We
incorporate open source software into our products. Although we closely monitor
our use of open source software, the terms of many open source software licenses
have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses
could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or
restrictions on our ability to sell our products. In such event, we could be
required to make our proprietary software generally available to third parties,
including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from third parties to
continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue
the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a
timely basis or at all, any of which could adversely affect our revenues and
operating expenses.  
  We
may not be able to obtain necessary licenses of third-party technology on
acceptable terms, or at all, which could delay product sales and development and
adversely impact product quality.   
 We
have incorporated third-party licensed technology into our current products. We
anticipate that we are also likely to need to license additional technology from
third-parties to develop new products or product enhancements in the future.
Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on
commercially reasonable terms. The inability to retain any third-party licenses
required in our current products or to obtain any new third-party licenses to
develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain
substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater
cost, and delay or prevent us from making these products or enhancements, any of
which could seriously harm the competitive position of our products.  
  Our
products must interoperate with many different networks, software applications
and hardware products, and this interoperability will depend on the continued
prevalence of open standards.   
 Our
products are designed to interoperate with our customers  existing and planned
networks, which have varied and complex specifications, utilize multiple
protocol standards, software applications and products from numerous vendors and
contain multiple products that have been added over time. As a result, we must
attempt to ensure that our products interoperate effectively with these existing
and planned networks. To meet these requirements, we have and must continue to
undertake development and testing efforts that require significant capital and
employee resources. We may not accomplish these development efforts quickly or
cost-effectively, or at all. If our products do not interoperate effectively,
installations could be delayed or orders for our products could be cancelled,
which would harm our revenue, gross margins and our reputation, potentially
resulting in the loss of existing and potential customers. The failure of our
products to interoperate effectively with our customers  networks may result in significant warranty, support and repair
costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our software
development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems.  
 40  

Additionally,
the interoperability of our products with multiple different networks is
significantly dependent on the continued prevalence of standards for IP
multimedia services, such as SIP or Session Initiation Protocol. Some of our
existing and potential competitors are network equipment providers who could
potentially benefit from the deployment of their own proprietary
non-standards-based architectures. If resistance to open standards by network
equipment providers becomes prevalent, it could make it more difficult for our
products to interoperate with our customers  networks, which would have a
material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products to service
providers.  
  We
are subject to the credit risk of our customers, which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity.   
 We
are subject to the credit risk of our customers. Businesses that are good credit
risks at the time of sale may become bad credit risks over time. In times of
economic recession, the number of our customers who default on payments owed to
us tends to increase. If we fail to adequately assess and monitor our credit
risks, we could experience longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and
higher bad debt expense. 
  We
are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates associated with
foreign currencies.   
 A
majority of our revenue activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we
are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in conducting
business globally in numerous currencies, of which the most significant to our
operations for the three months ended October 31, 2016 is the Canadian dollar.
We are primarily exposed to a fluctuating Canadian dollar as our operating
expenses are primarily denominated in Canadian dollars while our revenues are
primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We address certain financial exposures
through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of
derivative financial instruments. Our company s foreign currency risk management
program includes foreign currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting
designation that utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exposures
to the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S.
dollar-denominated cash flows. These instruments generally have a maturity of
less than one year. For these derivatives, our company reports the after-tax
gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders  equity and
reclassifies it into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction
affects earnings, and within the same line item on the consolidated statements
of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction. There can be no assurance
that our hedging program will not result in a negative impact on our earnings
and earnings per share. We did not enter into any forward contracts for hedging
purposes during the three months ended October 31, 2016 (2015 - none).  
  Risks Associated with our Common Stock   
  Our
directors control a substantial number of shares of our common stock, decreasing
your influence on stockholder decisions.   
 Based
on the 4,553,548 shares of common stock that were issued and outstanding as of
October 31, 2016, our directors owned approximately 30% of our outstanding
common stock. As a result, our directors as a group could have a significant
influence in delaying, deferring or preventing any potential change in control
of our company; they will be able to strongly influence the actions of our board
of directors even if they were to cease being directors of our company and can
effectively control the outcome of actions brought to our stockholders for
approval. Such a high level of ownership may adversely affect the exercise of
your voting and other stockholder rights.  
  We
do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.   
 We
do not intend to declare dividends for the foreseeable future, as we anticipate
that we will reinvest any future earnings in the development and growth of our
business. Therefore, investors will not receive any funds unless they sell their
common stock, and stockholders may be unable to sell their shares on favorable
terms. We cannot assure you of a positive return on investment or that
you will not lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock. 
 41  

The
exercise of all or any number of outstanding stock options or the issuance of
other stock-based awards or any issuance of shares to raise funds may dilute
your holding of shares of our common stock.   
 If
the holders of outstanding stock options, warrants and deferred share units
exercise or settle all of their vested stock options, warrants and deferred
share units as at October 31, 2016, then we would be required to issue an
additional 688,969 shares of our common stock, which would represent
approximately 15% of our issued and outstanding common stock after such
issuances. The exercise of any or all outstanding stock options that are
exercisable below market price will result in dilution to the interests of other
holders of our common stock.  
 We
may in the future grant to certain or all of our directors, officers, insiders
and key employees stock options to purchase the shares of our common stock,
bonus shares and other stock based compensation as non-cash incentives to such
persons. Subject to applicable stock exchange rules, if any, we may grant these
stock options and other stock based compensation at exercise prices equal to or
less than market prices, and we may grant them when the market for our
securities is depressed. The issuance of any additional shares of common stock
or securities convertible into common stock will cause our existing shareholders
to experience dilution of their holding of our common stock.  
 In
addition, shareholders could suffer dilution in their net book value per share
depending on the price at which such securities are sold. Such issuance may
cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other
shareholders. The dilution may result in a decline in the price of our shares of
common stock or a change in the control of our company.  
  We
may be considered a  penny stock.  Penny stock rules will limit the ability of
our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock.   
 The
SEC has adopted regulations which generally define  penny stock  to be any
equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share
or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain
exceptions. In addition, since our common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ
Capital Market below the $4.00 minimum bid price per share requirement, our
common stock would be considered a penny stock if we fail to satisfy the net
tangible assets and revenue tests in Rule 3a51-1 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Our securities may be covered by the penny stock rules, which
impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to
persons other than established customers and  accredited investors . The term
 accredited investor  refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of
$5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual
income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock
rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not
otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure
document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny
stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The
broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer
quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its
salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market
value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer
quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must
be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction
and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's
confirmation.  
 In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny
stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a
special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for
the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction.
These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of
trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these
penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability
of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules
discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. 
  The
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted sales practice
requirements, which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and/or sell shares
of our common stock.   
 42  

The
FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a
customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the
investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low
priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make
reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status,
tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations
of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative
low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The
FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that
their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and
sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for its shares.  
  Securities
analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may
publish no information which could cause our stock price or trading volume to
decline.   
 The
trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and
reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us and our business.
We do not control these analyst reports. As a relatively small public company,
we may be slow to attract research coverage and the analysts who publish
information about our common stock will have had relatively little experience
with our company, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our
results and make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. If any of
the analysts who cover us issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price,
our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of
our company or fail to regularly publish reports covering us, we could lose
visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading
volume to decline.  
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds.   
   Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities    
 None. 
   Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and
Affiliated Purchasers    

43  

On
March 16, 2016, we announced our intention to purchase, by way of a normal
course issuer bid, for cancellation purposes, up to 273,864 shares of our common
stock, representing approximately 10% of our then outstanding public float. We
believe that our shares trade in a price range that does not adequately reflect
their underlying value based on our business prospects.  
 Purchases
will be made on the open market through the facilities of the TSX, NASDAQ
Capital Market or such other stock exchange or quotation system upon which the
our shares are then listed or quoted, including other Canadian marketplaces, at
market prices prevailing at the time of purchase and may take place over a
12-month period beginning on March 21, 2016 and expiring on March 20, 2017. We
are permitted to make block purchases once per calendar week in accordance with
the rules of the TSX. The daily purchase restriction is 1,000 shares, subject to
certain prescribed exemptions. All shares purchased by our company under the
normal course issuer bid will be returned to treasury and cancelled.  
 In
connection with the normal course issuer bid, we entered into an automatic share
purchase plan with National Bank Financial Inc., in order to facilitate
purchases of our shares. Under the purchase plan, National Bank may purchase
shares on our behalf at times when we would ordinarily not be permitted to
purchase shares due to self-imposed trading blackout periods, insider trading
rules or otherwise. The purchase plan has been approved by the TSX and was
implemented as of March 21, 2016. Purchases will be made by National Bank on the
open market based upon the parameters prescribed by the TSX, applicable laws and
the terms and conditions of the purchase plan.  
 To our knowledge, none of our directors, senior officers or other insiders (as
defined in the TSX Company Manual) intends to sell any shares under the normal
course issuer bid. However, sales by such persons through the facilities of the
TSX may occur if the personal circumstances of any such person change or if any
such person makes a decision unrelated to these normal course purchases. The
benefits to any such person whose shares are purchased would be the same as the
benefits available to all other holders whose shares are purchased. 
 Stockholders
may obtain a copy of the notice submitted to the TSX with respect to the normal
course issuer bid, without charge, by contacting our Chief Financial Officer.
