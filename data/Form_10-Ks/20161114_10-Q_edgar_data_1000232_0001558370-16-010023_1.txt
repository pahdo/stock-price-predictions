NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The financial information presented as of any date other than December 31 has been prepared from the Company s books and records without audit.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, but is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been condensed or omitted.  There have been no significant changes to the Company s accounting and reporting policies as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of such financial statements, have been included.  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 

For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Basis of Presentation  :  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. (the  Company ,  we ,  our  or  us ), its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Kentucky Bank (the  Bank ) and KBI Insurance Company, Inc., and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, KB Special Assets Unit, LLC.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Nature of Operations  :  As a state bank, the Bank is subject to regulation by the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).  The Company, a bank holding company, is regulated by the Federal Reserve.   

KBI Insurance Company, Inc. is a subsidiary of Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. and is located in Las Vegas, Nevada.  It is a captive insurance subsidiary which provides various liability and property damage insurance policies for Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. and its related subsidiaries.  KBI Insurance Company, Inc. is regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance.   

Estimates in the Financial Statements  :  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. 

Trading Assets:    The Company engages in trading activities for its own account.  Securities that are held principally for resale in the near term are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings.  Interest and dividends are included in net interest income. 

Loss Contingencies  :  Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. 

Reclassifications  :  Some items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  Reclassifications had no effect on prior period net income or stockholders  equity.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards 

Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 

In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU creates a new topic, Topic 606, to provide guidance on revenue recognition for entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enter into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. The core principle of the guidance encourages an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additional disclosures are required to provide quantitative and qualitative information regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements.  The Company does not anticipate this update will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements because almost all revenue sources are outside the scope of ASU 2014-09. 

Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2016-1, Financial Instruments-Overall:  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 

In January 2016, the FASB issued an update (ASU 2016-1, Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities) which will require entities to measure many equity investments at fair value and recognize changes in fair value in net income.  This update does not apply to equity investments that result in consolidation, those accounted for under the equity method and certain others, and will eliminate use of the available for sale classification for equity securities while providing a new measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the net asset value practical expedient.  The guidance in this ASU will become effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not anticipate this update will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2016-2, Leases (Topic 842) 

This ASU is a standard that applies to all lease contracts. A lease contract is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of an asset for a period in exchange for consideration. Most leases are considered operating leases, which are not accounted for on the lessees  balance sheets. The significant change under this ASU is that those operating leases will be recorded on the balance sheet.   

Under this ASU, after determining that a contract contains a lease, a lessee will need to evaluate whether the lease is a finance or an operating lease at the commencement of a new lease and upon change in the lease term or change in the lessee s option to purchase the asset. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases under this ASU are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases under previous GAAP. All leases, whether finance or operating, will be on balance sheet unless they are subject to a short-term (12 months or less) lease accounting policy election. The lease term includes periods subject to an option to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option. This means leases of 12 months or less with extension options that meet that criteria will be recorded on the balance sheet. 

Finance leases under this ASU will recognize amortization expense on the asset separately from interest expense on the liability, similar to capital lease guidance under existing GAAP. Operating leases under this ASU will recognize lease expense that includes amortization expense on the leased asset and interest on the liability.  

The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is a lessee for a material level of operating leases and is analyzing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) 

8 

Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments are intended to improve the accounting for employee shared-based payments and affects all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including the income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements, but the Company does not expect these amendments to have a material impact. 

Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments (Topic 326) 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,     .  The final standard will change estimates for credit losses related to financial assets measured at amortized cost such as loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, and certain other contracts.  For estimating credit losses, the FASB is replacing the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. The largest impact will be on the allowance for loan and lease losses.  The standard will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 for public companies.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The primary purpose of the ASU is to reduce the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles on this topic. The ASU s amendments add or clarify guidance on eight cash flow issues. The guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable.  The Company does not anticipate this update will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 

2.  SECURITIES 

SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE 

Period-end securities are as follows: 

(in thousands) 

9 

Table of Contents  

The amortized cost and fair value of securities at September 30, 2016 by contractual maturity are shown below.  Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  Securities not due at a single maturity are shown separately.  Further discussion concerning Fair Value Measurements can be found in Note 9. 

Proceeds from sales of securities during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 were $23.9 million and $21.6 million.  Gross gains of $317 thousand and $413 thousand and gross losses of $0 and $3 thousand were realized on those sales, respectively.  The tax provision related to these realized net gains was $108 thousand and $139 thousand, respectively.   

Proceeds from sales of securities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $2.5 million and $12.5 million.  Gross gains of $40 thousand and $162 thousand and gross losses of $0 thousand and $3 thousand were realized on those sales, respectively.  The tax provision related to these realized net gains was $14 thousand and $54 thousand, respectively. 

Securities with unrealized losses  at September 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015 not recognized in income are as follows: 

September 30, 2016 

December 31, 2015 

10 

Table of Contents  

The Company evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation.  In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, we may consider many factors including, (1) whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, (2) whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, (3) the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition and near-term prospects, (4) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, and (5) whether we intend to sell the investment security or more likely than not will be required to sell the investment security before its anticipated recovery. 

Unrealized losses on securities included in the tables above have not been recognized into income because (1) all rated securities are investment grade and are of high credit quality, (2) management does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that management would not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, (3) management believes the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and (4) management believes the declines in fair value are temporary.  The Company believes the fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity. 

TRADING ASSETS 

The trading assets, which totaled $5.7 million at September 30, 2016 and $5.5 million at December 31, 2015, are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents and municipal securities which are generally held for 60 days or less. 

3.  LOANS 

Loans at period-end are as follows: 

(in thousands) 

The above loan balances include loans purchased in the Madison Financial Corporation acquisition. Loan balances acquired in the Madison Financial Corporation acquisition have no allocated allowance for loan losses.  The composition of loans acquired as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:

Purchased Credit Impaired Loans: 

The Company has purchased loans, for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and it was probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be collected. The carrying amount of those loans is as follows: 

There was no associated allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015 for purchased credit impaired loans.  The contractual principal balance of these loans was $2.8 million at September 30, 2016 and $4.2 million at December 31, 2015. 

Accretable yield, or income expected to be collected, is as follows.  There was no accretion recorded in income related to purchased credit impaired loans for the three months or nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Table of Contents  

The following tables present the balance in the allowance for loan losses and the recorded investment (excluding accrued interest receivable amounting to $2.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and $2.3 million at December 31, 2015) in loans by portfolio segment and based on impairment method as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Table of Contents  

The following tables present the recorded investment in nonaccrual, loans past due over 90 days still on accrual and accruing troubled debt restructurings by class of loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Nonaccrual loans secured by real estate make up 97.0% of the total nonaccrual loan balances at September 30, 2016. 

Nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days still on accrual include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans. 

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  All amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest payments and the contractual principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement.  

18 

Table of Contents  

Nonaccrual loans are loans for which payments in full of principal or interest is not expected or which principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection.  Other impaired loans may be loans showing signs of weakness or interruptions in cash flow, but ultimately are current or less than 90 days past due with respect to principal and interest and for which we anticipate full payment of principal and interest but not in accordance with contractual terms. 

Additional factors considered by management in determining impairment and non-accrual status include payment status, collateral value, availability of current financial information, and the probability of collecting all contractual principal and interest payments. 

The following tables present the aging of the recorded investment in past due and non-accrual loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 by class of loans: 

Troubled Debt Restructurings: 

The Company has allocated $54 thousand in specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings as of September 30, 2016.  The Company allocated $101 thousand for specific reserves to customers whose loan terms had been modified in troubled debt restructuring as of December 31, 2015.  The Company   

19 

Table of Contents  

has not committed to lend additional amounts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings.  

During 2015, one loan which had a balance of $4 million and was classified as a troubled debt restructuring as of December 31, 2014, was placed on non-accrual and reported as such as of  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  No loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings during the first nine months ended of 2016 or 2015. 

Credit Quality Indicators: 

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as:  current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.  The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk.  This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis.  The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

Special Mention.  Loans classified as special mention have one or more potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. 

Substandard.  Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans so classified have a well-defined and documented weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful.  Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows: 

20 

Table of Contents  

For consumer loans, the Company evaluates the credit quality based on the aging of the recorded investment in loans, which was previously presented.  Non-performing consumer loans are loans which are greater than 90 days past due or on non-accrual status, and total $51 thousand at September 30, 2016 and $6 thousand at December 31, 2015.

5.  EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per common share is net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares issuable under stock based compensation agreements. 

The factors used in the earnings per share computation follow:

Table of Contents  

Stock options for 1,200 shares of common stock for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2,400 shares of common stock for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015 were excluded from diluted earnings per share because their impact was antidilutive. 

6.  STOCK COMPENSATION 

We have four stock based compensation plans as described below. 

Two Stock Option Plans 

Under its expired 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan, the Company has granted certain officers and key employees stock option awards which vest and become fully exercisable at the end of five years and provided for issuance of up to 100,000 options.  

Under the expired 1993 Non-Employee Directors Stock Ownership Incentive Plan, the Company also granted certain directors stock option awards which vest and become fully exercisable immediately and provided for issuance of up to 20,000 options.

9.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and sets forth disclosures about fair value measurements.  ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments , allows entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  The Company has not elected the fair value option for any financial assets or liabilities. 

ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  It also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  This Topic describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1   Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 

Level 2   Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3   Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value: 

Investment Securities and Trading Assets  :  The fair values for available for sale investment securities and trading assets are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1).  For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2).  For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3).   

Impaired Loans  :  The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent third party real estate appraisals.  These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available for similar loans and collateral underlying such loans.  

No adjustments were made for the first nine months of 2016 and adjustments totaled $14 thousand for the first nine months of 2015, and $0 thousand for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, and resulted in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.   

25 

Table of Contents  

Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification.  Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted in accordance with the allowance policy.    

Other Real Estate Owned:    Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure and classified as other real estate owned (OREO) are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis.  These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell.  Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually.  These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach with data from comparable properties.  Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments were $131 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $372 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and resulted in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  Such adjustments were $46 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $25 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and resulted in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights:    Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income, resulting in a Level 3 classification.   

Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis  

Available for sale investment securities and trading assets are the Company s only balance sheet items that meet the disclosure requirements for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Disclosures are as follows in the tables below.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:

December 31, 2015: 

29 

Table of Contents  

The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair values are described as follows: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents -   The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1. 

Interest Bearing Deposits     The carrying amounts of interest bearing deposits approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1. 

FHLB Stock -   It is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. 

Loans -   Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows:  For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification.  Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification.  Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value as described previously. The methods used to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price. 

The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Deposits -   The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in a Level 1 classification.  The carrying amounts of variable rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification.  Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Borrowings -   The carrying amounts of borrowings under repurchase agreements approximate their fair values resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

The carrying amount of the Company s variable rate borrowings approximate their fair values resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Federal Funds Purchased   - The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1. 

FHLB Advances, Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures -   The fair values of the Company s FHLB advances and other borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

The fair values of the Company s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification. 

Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable -   The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value resulting in a Level 2 or Level 3 classification based on the level of the related asset/liability. 

Off-balance Sheet Instruments -   Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing.  The fair value of off-balance sheet instruments is not material.

Forward-Looking Statements 

The following discussion provides information about the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the dates and periods indicated.  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report and the Management s Discussion and Analysis in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

This discussion contains forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties.  We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the federal securities laws. These statements are not historical facts, but rather statements based on our current expectations regarding our business strategies and their intended results and our future performance.  Forward-looking statements are preceded by terms such as  expects,   believes,   anticipates,   intends,   estimates,   potential,   may,  and similar expressions. 

Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:  economic conditions (both generally and more specifically in the markets, including the tobacco market and the thoroughbred horse industry, in which we and our Bank operate); competition for our subsidiary s customers from other providers of financial and mortgage services; government legislation, regulation and monetary policy (which changes from time to time and over which we have no control); changes in interest rates (both generally and more specifically mortgage interest rates); material unforeseen changes in the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of our subsidiary s customers;  

adequacy of the allowance for losses on loans and the level of future provisions for losses on loans; and other risks detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. 

As a result of the uncertainties and the assumptions on which this discussion and the forward-looking statements are based, actual future operations and results in the future may differ materially from those indicated herein. 

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.  Our forward-looking statements are made as of the date of the report, and we undertake no obligation to republish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

Summary 

The Company recorded net income of $6.3 million, or $2.10 basic earnings and diluted earnings per share for the first nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.2 million or $1.85 basic earnings and diluted earnings per share for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  The first nine months net earnings reflect an increase of $1.1 million, or 21.4%, compared to the same time period in 2015.  The increase in net earnings is mostly attributed to an increase of $2.8 million, or 13.4%, in net interest income, an increase of $250 thousand, or 2.8%, in non-interest income and a decrease of $250 thousand, or 24.4%, for the provision for loan losses.  These positive variances were partially offset by an increase of $2.1 million, or 8.8%, in non-interest expense.  Increases in both income and expense are largely attributed to the Company acquiring Madison Financial Corportion on July 24, 2015.   

The earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $2.4 million or $0.79 basic and diluted earnings per share compared to $1.5 million or $0.52 basic and diluted earnings per share for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The earnings for the three month period in 2016 reflect an increase of 53.5% compared to the same time period in 2015.

Assets held for sale increased from $0 at December 31, 2015 to $969 thousand at September 30, 2016.  The assets held for sale balance represents assets associated with one of our existing branches expected to be sold during the fourth quarter of 2016.  These assets were included in bank premeises and equipment, net on the balance sheet at December 31, 2015. 

Total deposits decreased from $759.0 million on December 31, 2015 to $734.2 million on September 30, 2016, a decrease of $24.8 million.  Non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased $8.6 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 while time deposits $250 thousand and over increased $6.4 million and other interest bearing deposit accounts decreased $39.7 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. 

Public fund account balances decreased $38.1 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  Public fund accounts typically decrease during the first three quarters of the year and increase during the last quarter of the year due to tax payments collected during the fourth quarter and then withdrawn from the Bank during the following months.

Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $18.3 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, of which $10.0 million were short-term borrowings, repurchase agreements increased $5.0 million and federal funds purchased increased $10.5 million. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income was $24.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $21.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 13.4%.   Net interest income was $8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 6.2%.  

The interest spread, excluding tax equivalent adjustments, was 3.37% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 3.38% for the first nine months of 2015.  For the first nine months in 2016, the yield on assets increased from 3.85% in 2015 to 3.86% in 2016, excluding tax equivalent adjustments.  The yield on loans increased two basis points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 from 4.72% to 4.74% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The yield on securities, excluding tax equivalent adjustments, decreased one basis point during the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015 from 2.31% in 2015 to 2.30% in 2016.  The cost of liabilities was 0.49% for the first nine months in 2016 compared to 0.50% in 2015.  The acquisition of Madison Financial on July 24, 2015 resulted in significant larger average balances for our interest bearing assets.  

Year to date average loans, excluding overdrafts, increased $82.3 million, or 14.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Loan interest income increased $2.8 million during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015.  Year to date average total deposits increased from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016 by $86.2 million or 12.6%.  Year to date average interest bearing deposits increased $62.1 million, or 126%, from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  Deposit interest expense increased $347 thousand for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  Year to date average borrowings, including repurchase agreements, increased $13.2 million, or 11.5% from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  Interest expense on borrowed funds, including repurchase agreements, increased $62 thousand for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.   

The volume rate analysis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 indicates that $2.9 million of the increase in loan interest income is attributable to an increase in loan volume and $254 thousand of the increase in securities interest income is attributable to an increase in the volume of our security portfolio.  Further, a decrease in loan rates caused a decrease of $155 thousand in interest income and an increase in rates in our security portfolio contributed an increase of $49 thousand in securities interest income.  The net effect to interest income was an increase of $3.2 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same time period in 2015. 

Also based on the following volume rate analysis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase in demand deposit interest rates resulted in $341 thousand additional interest expense while decreases in interest rates paid for time deposits resulted in a reduction of $335 thousand in interest expense. The change in volume in deposits and borrowings was responsible for a $325 thousand increase in interest expense, of which an increase in time deposits resulted in an increase of $131 thousand in interest expense and an increase in repurchase agreements and other borrowings resulted in an increase of $154 thousand in interest expense.  The net effect to interest expense was an increase of $345 thousand.  As a result, the increase in net interest income for the first nine months in 2016 is mostly attributed to growth in the Company s loan and security portfolios. 

The volume rate analysis for the three months ended September 30, 2016 indicates that $726 thousand of the increase in net interest income is attributable to growth in the Company s balance sheet.  However, higher rates primarily with demand deposits,  resulted in a $256 thousand decrease in net interest income.  The net change to net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was an increase of $470 thousand.

ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 include a decrease of $558 thousand in other income.  Other income was higher in 2015 due to the Company receiving $747 thousand in June 2015 for restitution related to the settlement of the pension dispute disclosed in prior filings.    

Favorable variances to non-interest income for the first nine months of 2016 include an increase of $572 thousand in service charges, an increase of $171 thousand in brokerage fee income, an increase of $240 thousand in debit card interchange income and an increase of $117 thousand in gains on the sale of loans.  Decreases to non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 include a decrease of $119 thousand in gains on the sale of securities and a decrease of $141 thousand in bargain purchase gains.  Favorable variances in non-interest income for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same time period in 2015 includes a gain of $186 thousand in service charge income, an increase of $129 thousand in gains on the sale of mortgage loans and an increase of $302 thousand in other income.    

The gain on the sale of  loans increased from $1.2 million during the first nine months of 2015 to $1.3 million during the first nine months of 2016, an increase of $117 thousand.  For the three months ended September 30, the gain on the sale of mortgage loans increased from $404 thousand in 2015 to $533 thousand in 2016.   

The volume of loans originated to sell during the first nine months of 2016 increased $4.3 million compared to the same time period in 2015.  The volume of loans originated to sell the during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 increased $5.0 million.  The volume of mortgage loan originations and sales is generally inverse to rate changes.  A change in the mortgage loan rate environment can have a significant impact on the related gain on sale of mortgage loans.  Loan service fee income, net of amortization and impairment expense, was $23 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $153 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $130 thousand.   

Loan service fee income, net of amortization and impairment expense, was $(26) thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $45 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $71 thousand.  During the first nine months of 2016, the market value adjustment to the carrying value of the mortgage servicing right was a net write-down of $106 thousand, as the fair value of this asset decreased.  During the first nine months of 2015, the market value adjustment to the carrying value of the mortgage servicing right asset was a positive valuation adjustment of $43 thousand as the fair value of the mortgage servicing asset increased.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the market value adjustment to the carrying value of the mortgage serving right asset was a net write-down of $64 thousand compared to a positive valuation adjustment of $9 thousand during the third quarter of 2015.  

Non-Interest Expense 

Total non-interest expense increased $2.1 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  Total non-interest expense increased $185 thousand for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Management continues to consider opportunities for branch expansion, and will also consider acquisition opportunities that help advance its strategic objectives, which would result in additional future non-interest expense. 

For the comparable nine month periods, salaries and employees benefits expense increased $1.3 million, an increase of 10.6%.  The number of full-time employee equivalent employees increased from 228 at June 30, 2015 to 247 at September 30, 2016, an increase of 19 full-time employee equivalent employees.  The increase in the number of employees is largely attributed to the Company acquiring Madison Financial Corporation on July 24, 2015.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, salaries and employee benefits expense increased $308 thousand, or 7.3%.   

Occupancy expense decreased $56 thousand to $2.8 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same time period in 2015.  Building rent expense increased $37 thousand due to acquiring Madison Financial Corporation on July 24, 2015.  The acquisition provided the Company three additional branches in Richmond, KY, all of which are leased.  Depreciation expense decreased $104 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015.  Expenses incurred for assets not depreciated decreased $79 thousand during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015.  This decrease is attributed to purchasing additional equipment during the first

quarter of 2015 which resulted in additional expense. Occupancy expense decreased $127 thousand to $974 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable three months in 2015. 

Legal and professional fees increased $524 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the first nine months in 2015 and increased $211 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.   

Debit card expenses increased $206 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to increased volume and increased $68 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in debit card expense is attributed to an increase in debit card interchange activity which also resulted in increases in debit card interchange income as shown on the income statement.  

Repossession expense decreased $121 thousand for the first nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same time period in 2015 and increased $18 thousand for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Repossession expenses are reported net of rental income earned on repossessed properties.  Net repossession expenses were lower during the first nine months of 2016 when compared to 2015 due to net write-downs totaling $131 thousand in 2016 compared to net write-downs of $252 thousand in 2015.   

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 8.5% compared to 7.3% in 2015.  The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 0.3% compared to 6.3% in 2015.  These effective tax rates are less than the statutory rate as a result of the Company investing in tax-free securities, loans and other investments which generate tax credits for the Company.   

The Company also has a captive insurance subsidiary which contributes to reducing taxable income.  Income tax expense increased $171 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the first nine months in 2015.  Tax-exempt interest income increased $280 thousand for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015.  Further, for the first nine months of 2016, the Company had tax credits totaling $836 thousand for investments made in low income housing projects which represented an increase of $378 thousand compared to similar tax credits for the first nine months of 2015.  

As part of normal business, the Bank typically makes tax free loans to select municipalities in our market and invests in selected tax free securities, primarily in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  In making these investments, the Company considers the overall impact to managing our net interest margin, credit worthiness of the underlying issuer and the favorable impact on our tax position.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company averaged $90.4 million in tax free securities and $37.7 million in tax free loans.  As of September 30, 2016, the weighted average remaining maturity for the tax free securities is 100 months, while the weighted average remaining maturity for the tax free loans is 150 months. 

Liquidity and Funding 

Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations.  The Company s primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of investment securities and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. 

Liquidity risk is the possibility that we may not be able to meet our cash requirements in an orderly manner.  Management of liquidity risk includes maintenance of adequate cash and sources of cash to fund operations and to meet the needs of borrowers, depositors and creditors.  Excess liquidity has a negative impact on earnings as a result of the lower yields on short-term assets. 

Cash and cash equivalents were $17.1 million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $28.0 million at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is attributed to a decrease of $10.0 million in cash and due from banks and a decrease of $951 thousand in federal funds sold.  

In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the securities portfolio provides an important source of liquidity.  Securities available for sale totaled $255.6 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $264.2 million at December 31, 2015.    

38 

Table of Contents  

Securities classified as trading assets totaled $5.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $5.5 million at December 31, 2015. 

The securities available for sale and trading assets are available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis.  However, we expect our customers  deposits to be adequate to meet our funding demands. 

Generally, we rely upon net cash inflows from financing activities, supplemented by net cash inflows from operating activities, to provide cash used in our investing activities.  As is typical of many financial institutions, significant financing activities include deposit gathering and the use of short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements along with long-term debt.  Our primary investing activities include purchasing investment securities and loan originations. 

For the first nine months of 2016, deposits decreased $24.8 million compared to December 31, 2015.  The Company s borrowed funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $18.3 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, federal funds purchased increased $10.5 million and total repurchase agreements increased $5.0 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. 

Management is aware of the challenge of funding sustained loan growth.  Therefore, in addition to deposits, other sources of funds, such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances, may be used.  We rely on Federal Home Loan Bank advances for both liquidity and asset/liability management purposes.  These advances are used primarily to fund long-term fixed rate residential mortgage loans.  As of September 30, 2016, we have sufficient collateral to borrow an additional $73 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank.   

In addition, as of September 30, 2016, $50 million is available in overnight borrowing through various correspondent banks and the Company has access to an additional $276 million in brokered deposits.  In light of this, management believes there is sufficient liquidity to meet all reasonable borrower, depositor and creditor needs in the present economic environment. 

Capital Requirements 

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company s and the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The Company and Bank capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of Total and Tier I capital, including Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, (as defined in the applicable banking regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital to average assets (as defined).  Management believes, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 

The most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum Total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, Common Equity Tier 1 risk based and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the following table.  There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution s category. 

In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method of calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

39 

Table of Contents  

Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.  The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain  available-for-sale  securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirement unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is exercised, which the Company did opt-out of. 

The rule limits a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a  capital conservation buffer  consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.   

The capital conservation buffer was 0.625% at September 30, 2016 and the Company is in compliance with the capital conservation buffer.  The final rule became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2016.  In accordance with the final rule, the capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and will continue through January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective. The Company s and the Bank s actual amounts and ratios are presented in the table below:

Non-Performing Assets 

As of September 30, 2016, our non-performing assets totaled $9.8 million or 0.99% of assets compared to $11.9 million or 1.23% of assets at December 31, 2015 (See table below.)  The Company experienced a decrease of $579 thousand in non-accrual loans from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, non-accrual loans include $3.9 million in loans secured by farmland, $1.6 million in loans secured by 1-4 family properties, $78 thousand in loans secured by non-farm and non-residential properties, $126 thousand in loans secured by multi-family residential loans, $138 thousand in agricultural production loans, $4 thousand in commercial loans and $30 thousand in consumer loans.   

Loans secured by real estate composed 97.0% of the non-performing loans as of September 30, 2016 and 96.5% as of December 31, 2015.  Forgone interest income on non-accrual loans totaled $65 thousand for the first nine months of 2016 compared to forgone interest of $47 thousand for the same time period in 2015.  Accruing loans that are contractually 90 days or more past due as of September 30, 2016 totaled $127 thousand compared to $1.0 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $873 thousand. 

Total nonperforming and restructured loans decreased $1.6 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  The decrease in non-performing loan balances contributed to the decrease in the ratio of nonperforming and restructured loans to loans which decreased 33 basis points to 1.21% from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. 

In addition, the amount the Company has recorded as other real estate owned decreased $509 thousand from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the amount recorded as other real estate owned totaled $1.8 million compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2015.  During the first nine months of 2016, $235 thousand in loan balances were foreclosed upon and added to other real estate properties while $571 thousand in other real estate properties were sold.  The allowance as a percentage of non-performing and restructured loans and other real estate owned increased from 55% at December 31, 2015 to 75% at September 30, 2016. 

Nonperforming and Restructured Assets 

We maintain a  watch list  of agricultural, commercial, real estate mortgage, and real estate construction loans and review those loans on a regular basis.  Generally, assets are designated as  watch list  loans to ensure more frequent monitoring.  If we determine that there is serious doubt as to performance in accordance with original terms of the contract, then the loan is generally downgraded and often placed on non-accrual status. 

We review and evaluate nonaccrual loans, past due loans, and loans graded substandard or worse on a regular basis to determine if the loan should be evaluated for impairment and whether specific allocations are needed.

Provision for Loan Losses 

The loan loss provision for the first nine months of 2016 was $775 thousand compared to $1.0 million for the first nine months of 2015.  The loan loss provision for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was $175 thousand compared to $375 thousand for the three month period ended September 30, 2015.   The decrease in the total loan loss provision during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same time period in 2015 is attributed to improved loan quality in our loan portfolio and, during the first quarter of 2016, the Company recovered $259 thousand for a loan that was charged off in a prior year.  This recovery of a prior charge-off resulted in increasing the allowance for loan losses by $259 thousand with no additional provision for loan loss expense.    

Management evaluates the loan portfolio by reviewing the historical loss rate for each respective loan type and assigns risk multiples to certain categories to account for qualitative factors including current economic conditions.  The average loss rates are reviewed for trends in the analysis, as well as comparisons to peer group loss rates.  Management makes allocations within the allowance for loan losses for specifically classified loans regardless of loan amount, collateral or loan type.  Loan categories are evaluated utilizing subjective factors in addition to the historical loss calculations to determine a loss allocation for each of those types. 

As this analysis, or any similar analysis, is an imprecise measure of loss, the allowance is subject to ongoing adjustments.  Therefore, management will often take into account other significant factors that may be necessary or prudent in order to reflect probable incurred losses in the total loan portfolio. 

Nonperforming loans and restructured loans decreased $1.6 million from December 31, 2015 to $8.0 million at September 30, 2016.  The Company recorded net recoveries of $109 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net charge-offs of $895 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a recovery of $259 for one loan which was charged-off in a prior year.  Future levels of charge-offs will be determined by the particular facts and circumstances surrounding individual loans. 

Based on the above information, management believes the current loan loss allowance is sufficient to meet probable incurred loan losses.

Item 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Asset/Liability management control is designed to ensure safety and soundness, maintain liquidity and regulatory capital standards, and achieve acceptable net interest income.  Management considers interest rate risk to be the most significant market risk since a bank s net income is largely dependent on net interest income.  Our exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Asset/Liability Committee.  Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes.   

These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values.  The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk, while at the same time, maximize income. 

Management realizes certain risks are inherent and that the goal is to identify and minimize the risks.  The primary tools used by management are interest rate shock and economic value of equity (EVE) simulations.  The Company has $5.7 million in market risk sensitive instruments which are held for trading purposes.  These assets are held for a minimal period of time and are used to generate profits on short-term differences in price while earning interest for the time they are held. 

Using interest rate shock simulations, the following table depicts the change in net interest income resulting from 100 and 300 basis point changes in rates on the Company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. 

The projections are based on balance sheet growth assumptions and repricing opportunities for new, maturing and adjustable rate amounts.  As of September 30, 2016, the projected percentage changes are within limits approved by our Board of Directors ( Board ).

Table of Contents  

Although management does analyze and monitor the projected percentage change in a declining interest rate environment, due to the current rate environment many of the current deposit rates cannot decline an additional 100 basis points.  Therefore, management places more emphasis in the rising rate environment scenarios.  Similar to prior periods, this period s volatility is slightly lower in each rate shock simulation when compared to the same period a year ago.  The projected net interest income report summarizing our interest rate sensitivity as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:

Projections from September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, year one reflected declines of 2.2% and 2.8% in net interest income.  The 100 basis point increase in rates reflected a 0.2% decrease in net interest income in 2016 compared to an increase of 0.0% in 2015. 

EVE applies discounting techniques to future cash flows to determine the present value of assets, liabilities, and therefore equity.  Based upon applying these techniques to the September 30, 2016, balance sheet, a 100 basis point increase in rates results in a 11.5% decrease in EVE.  A 100 basis point decrease in rates results in a 1.2% increase in EVE.  These are within the Board approved limits. 

Item 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

As of the end of the period covered by this report, and pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act).  Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. 

We also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, there has been no such change during the quarter covered by this report. 

Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
