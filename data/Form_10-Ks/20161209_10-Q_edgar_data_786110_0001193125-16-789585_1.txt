     THE GYMBOREE CORPORATION   
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
 (Unaudited)     1. Basis of Presentation
    The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, which include The Gymboree Corporation (the
 Company,   we  or  us ) and our 100%-owned subsidiaries have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. For periods presented prior to the sale of the Gymboree
Play   Music business on July 15, 2016, the condensed consolidated financial statements also include Gymboree (China) Commercial and Trading Co. Ltd. ( Gymboree China ) and Gymboree (Tianjin) Educational Informational
Consultation Co. Ltd. ( Gymboree Tianjin ) (collectively, the variable interest entities or  VIEs ) (see Note 3). Certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Transition
Report on Form 10-K for the 26 weeks ended July 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2016.  
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the
opinion of management, necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016
( first quarter of fiscal 2017 ) are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be expected for the 52-week period ending July 29, 2017 ( fiscal 2017 ) or any future period.  
  2. Recently Issued Accounting Standards   
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under this ASU, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a
lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for
the lease term. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Although we have not yet determined the impact of the new standard, we
believe this ASU will have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements due to the substantial number of leases that we have.  
 Effective during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we adopted ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs and applied the provisions retrospectively to all prior periods. As a result of this adoption, the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt and long-term
sale-leaseback financing liability are presented as an offset against the long-term debt and long-term sale-leaseback financing liability, while the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our line of credit under our ABL Revolving Facility
are included in other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Below is a summary of the changes made in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2015 (in thousands):  
   
   In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial
Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, to provide guidance on principles and definitions to reduce diversity in the timing and content of
disclosures when evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern. This ASU is effective in the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We
have not yet determined the impact of the new standard on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
      7  

Table of Contents  

  ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers clarifies the
principles of recognizing revenue and creates common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. The effective date of ASU 2014-09 is for fiscal years and
interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. We have not yet determined the impact of the new standard on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  3. Discontinued Operations   
 On July 15, 2016, we closed a transaction to sell all of the equity and certain intellectual property attributable to
Gymboree Play Programs, Inc. ( Play   Music  or  GPPI ), the Company s global Play   Music business, to Zeavion Holding Pte. Ltd. ( Zeavion ). Upon closing, the Company received consideration of
$128.1 million, approximately $109.9 million of which is restricted under the Term Loan to reduce the Term Loan, fund capital expenditures or pay income taxes associated with the gain on the sale of GPPI. During the 13 weeks ended October 29,
2016, the Company used $10.7 million of restricted cash to fund capital expenditures and pay income taxes associated with the gain on sale of GPPI. As of October 29, 2016, the remaining balance of the restricted cash attributable to the sale of
GPPI was $96.3 million.    Concurrent with the July 15, 2016 sale of GPPI, our VIEs, Gymboree Tianjin (master
franchisee of Gymboree Play   Music in China) and Gymboree China (operator of Gymboree retail stores in China), indirectly controlled by Gymboree Holding, Ltd. and investment funds sponsored by Bain Capital, were also sold to Zeavion.  
 In accordance with ASC 205-20,  Presentation - Discontinued Operations , the sale of our global Play   Music
business (including GPPI and Gymboree Tianjin) was determined to represent a strategic shift to the Company s business and therefore, the financial results of GPPI and Gymboree Tianjin as of and for the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015 have
been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Due to its insignificance to our consolidated financial statements, Gymboree China has not been reported as discontinued operations. However,
pursuant to ASC 810-10, Consolidation, we have deconsolidated Gymboree China s financial results as of July 15, 2016, the date of sale as we are no longer the primary beneficiary.  
 Gymboree Play   Music was previously reported under the Gymboree Play   Music reportable segment while
Gymboree Tianjin and Gymboree China were previously reported under the VIE reportable segment in our segment footnote disclosure.

4. Fair Value Measurements   
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis   
 Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include money market funds (Level 1) and forward
foreign exchange contracts (Level 2). The fair value of money market funds was $96.6 million and $110.3 million as of October 29, 2016 and July 30, 2016, respectively. We had no money market funds as of October 31, 2015. The fair
value of the forward foreign exchange contracts was $69,000 (asset), $123,000 (liability), and $27,000 (liability) as of October 29, 2016, July 30, 2016, and October 31, 2015, respectively.  
 The carrying value of cash, receivables, line of credit borrowings, and payables approximate their estimated fair values due
to the short maturities of these instruments.    We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt using current market
yields. These current market yields are considered Level 2 inputs. The estimated fair value of long-term debt is as follows (in thousands):      
 
      9  

Table of Contents  

   Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis   
 During the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, we recorded property and equipment impairment
charges of $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively, related to assets of under-performing stores. The fair market value of these non-financial assets was determined using the income approach and Level 3 inputs, which required management to make
significant estimates about future cash flows. Management estimates the amount and timing of future cash flows based on historical operating results and its experience and knowledge of the retail market in which each store operates. These impairment
charges are included in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Liabilities   
  Goodwill     Goodwill
allocated to our reportable segments as of October 29, 2016, July 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015 is as follows (in thousands):      
    Goodwill Impairment   
 As of October 29, 2016, we did not identify impairment indicators for goodwill. In determining whether an indicator of
impairment is present, we qualitatively assessed the valuation of our retail segment reporting units (Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet, and Janie and Jack) and International Retail Franchise reporting unit. This qualitative assessment resulted in a
determination that it was more likely than not the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amount as of October 29, 2016. If the results of our operations through the remainder of fiscal year 2017 or our forecast of future
operating performance declines, there is a potential for goodwill impairment related to our Gymboree Retail reporting unit.  
 In addition, other significant adverse changes to our business environment or future revenues or cash flows could cause us to
record additional impairment charges in future periods, which could be material. Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the end of our fourth fiscal period (fiscal November).  
 As of July 30, 2016, we performed the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test for the Gymboree Retail,
Gymboree Outlet and International Retail Franchise reporting units due to a triggering event resulting from the softening of the retail environment and performance that did not meet expectations. We concluded that goodwill impairment was not
required for any of our reporting units as the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by more than 40%. As of July 30, 2016, the fair value of the Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet and International Retail
Franchise reporting units were $594.0 million, $147.0 million and $45.0 million, respectively, which exceeded the carrying values of $414.0 million, $102.4 million and $26.2 million, respectively. There was no triggering event for the Janie and Jack
reporting unit as of July 30, 2016. As of November 28, 2015, the fair value of the Janie and Jack reporting unit was $274.0 million, which exceeded its carrying value of $77.2 million.

   Intangible Assets and Liabilities   
 Intangible assets and liabilities consist of the following (in thousands):  
   
    Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment   
 As of October 29, 2016, we did not identify impairment indicators for indefinite-lived intangible assets (the Gymboree,
Janie and Jack and Crazy 8 trade names). In determining whether an indicator of impairment is present, we qualitatively assessed whether it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying
amount as of October 29, 2016. If the results of our operations through the remainder of fiscal year 2017 or our forecast of future operating performance declines, there is a potential for indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment.  
 In addition, other significant adverse changes to our business environment or future revenue or cash flows could cause us to
record additional impairment charges in future periods, which could be material. Our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test is performed at the end of our fourth fiscal period (fiscal November).  
 As of July 30, 2016, we tested certain indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, specifically the Gymboree and
Crazy 8 trade names, due to a triggering event resulting from the softening of the retail environment and performance that did not meet expectations. As of July 30, 2016, the estimated fair values of the Gymboree trade names were $262.1
million, which exceeded the carrying values of $240.5 million. As of July 30, 2016, the estimated fair value and carrying value of the Crazy 8 trade name was $15.9 million. As of November 28, 2015, the fair value of the Janie and Jack
trade name was $61.6 million, which exceeded its carrying value of $42.2 million.

    6. Line of Credit and Long-term Debt   
 Line of credit borrowings and long-term debt consist of (in thousands):  
   
    Line of Credit   
 Our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility ( ABL Revolving Facility ) matures on the earlier of
(i) September 24, 2020 and (ii) the date that is 60 days before the scheduled final maturity date of any tranche of the Term Loan (which is currently due to mature in February 2018) or the Notes (which are currently due to mature in
December 2018), unless such indebtedness is cumulatively equal to or less than $25.0 million in the aggregate and a reserve against the borrowing base is imposed equal to the amount of such indebtedness. The ABL revolving commitment will therefore
mature in December 2017 unless the Term Loan and the Notes (other than an aggregate amount of Term Loans and Notes that is equal to or less than $25.0 million) are refinanced with indebtedness having a final maturity date later than February 2018.
   The ABL Revolving Facility provides for financing of up to $225 million in a revolving line of credit. Line of
credit availability under the ABL Revolving Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of certain assets of the Company, any subsidiary co-borrowers and any subsidiary guarantors that are available to collateralize the borrowings thereunder,
and is reduced by the level of outstanding letters of credit and the outstanding amount of the ABL Term Loan. The line of credit available under the ABL Revolving Facility was reduced by letter of credit utilization totaling $30.8 million as of
October 29, 2016. Undrawn line of credit availability under the ABL Revolving Facility, after being reduced by outstanding line of credit borrowings, letter of credit

utilization and outstanding balance of ABL Term Loan, was $114.2 million as of October 29, 2016, subject to a minimum amount of  Combined Availability  and  Availability 
as defined below. Our undrawn line of credit availability, net of the minimum amount of combined availability and availability, was approximately $92.0 million as of October 29, 2016.  
 Line of credit borrowings under the ABL Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either
(a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S.
dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%, or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing
adjusted for certain additional costs ( Adjusted LIBOR ), in each case plus an applicable margin. As of October 29, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on our line of credit borrowings outstanding under the ABL Revolving Facility
was 2.8%. In addition to paying interest on outstanding line of credit borrowings under the ABL Revolving Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on unutilized commitments thereunder, which is between 0.250% and 0.375% per annum.  
 The ABL Facility contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and pay
dividends. It requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a minimum amount of  Combined Availability  and  Availability  for as long as the ABL Term Loan remains outstanding.  Combined Availability 
is an amount equal to (a) the ABL Term Loan borrowing base minus (b) the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the ABL Facility (including the ABL Term Loan, revolving line of credit borrowings and letter of credit
utilization.  Availability  is equal to the lesser of (A) (I) the revolving credit ceiling (which as of October 29, 2016 was $225.0 million) minus (II) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the revolving line of
credit and letter of credit utilization and (B) (I) the revolving line of credit borrowing base minus (II) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit and letter of credit utilization. Under the new
availability covenant, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries must maintain (i) Combined Availability in excess of the greater of (x) $17.5 million and (y) 10% of the ABL Term Loan borrowing base, and (ii) Availability in
excess of the greater of (x) $17.5 million and (y) 10% of the lesser of (A) the applicable revolving line of credit borrowing base and (B) the revolving credit ceiling. The ABL Facility also contains a financial covenant (i.e.,
minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio), but such financial covenant is not required to be tested as long as the Company s ABL Term Loan remains outstanding. As of October 29, 2016, we were not required to test compliance with
this covenant. Failure to maintain the minimum levels of Combined Availability and Availability required by this covenant would result in an event of default under the ABL Facility.  
 In addition, the ABL Facility provides that if the lesser of (i) Combined Availability and (ii) Availability falls
below the greater of (x) $22.5 million and (y) 12.5% of the lesser of (A) the applicable revolving line of credit borrowing base and (B) the revolving credit ceiling (the  Cash Dominion Threshold ) for 5 consecutive
business days, the agent for the ABL lenders may, subject to certain exceptions, take control of the Company s bank accounts and apply the funds therein to pay down the Company s obligations under the ABL Facility. The Company would regain
control of its bank accounts (a  Cash Dominion Cure ) once the lesser of (i) Combined Availability and (ii) Availability had exceeded the Cash Dominion Threshold for 30 consecutive days, provided that the ABL Facility permits no
more than three Cash Dominion Cures in any rolling 365-day period.    The obligations under the ABL Facility are secured,
subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of our assets. Our 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed our obligations under the ABL Facility (see Note 14).  
  ABL Term Loan     On
April 22, 2016, we entered into an agreement that provides for a senior secured term loan (the  ABL Term Loan  and together with the ABL Revolving Facility, the  ABL Facility ) of $50.0 million, subject to a borrowing base,
the proceeds of which may be used to finance the acquisition of working capital assets, including the purchase of inventory and equipment, in each case in the ordinary course of business, to finance capital expenditures, to finance permitted
acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of the Notes. The maturity date of the ABL Term Loan is the same as the maturity date of the ABL Revolving Facility. The ABL Term Loan totaled $49.4 million as of
October 29, 2016.    The ABL Term Loan bears interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over
a year of 360 days) at a 90-day LIBOR contract rate as determined by the agent for the ABL Term Loan monthly on the first day of each calendar month, plus 10.25% per annum, or, in certain circumstances, at the prime rate, plus 9.25% per
annum. Interest is payable monthly. As of October 29, 2016, the interest rate under our ABL Term Loan was 11.1%.  
      13  

Table of Contents  

  The ABL Term Loan requires us to make quarterly payments equal to $0.6 million,
with the balance due on the maturity of the ABL Term Loan, which is the same as the maturity date of the ABL revolving commitment.  
 The obligations under the ABL Term Loan are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of our assets and
those of our 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries. Our 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries also have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Company s obligations under the ABL Term Loan (see Note 14).  
  Term Loan     We have an
agreement with several lenders for an $820 million senior secured Term Loan, with a maturity date of February 2018. The interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan is, at our option, a base rate plus an additional marginal rate of 2.5% or
the Adjusted LIBOR rate (with a 1.5% floor) plus an additional rate of 3.5%. As of October 29, 2016, the interest rate under our Term Loan was 5%.  
 The Term Loan requires us to make quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the original $820 million principal amount of the
Term Loan made on the closing date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, with the balance due in February 2018. The Term Loan also has mandatory and voluntary pre-payment provisions, including a requirement that we prepay the Term Loan with a
certain percentage of our annual excess cash flow. We calculated our excess cash flow for the 26-week transition period ended July 30, 2016 and concluded we are not required to make any excess cash flow payments on the Term Loan during fiscal
2017. Voluntary prepayments and the excess cash flow prepayments made in prior fiscal years were applied toward our remaining quarterly amortization payments payable under the Term Loan through fiscal 2017. Our next quarterly payment payable under
the Term Loan is due in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.    The obligations under the Term Loan are secured, subject to
certain exceptions, by substantially all of our assets and those of our 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries. Our 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries also have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Company s obligations under the Term Loan (see
Note 14).     Senior Notes   
 In fiscal 2010, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 9.125% Senior Notes due in December 2018 (the
 Notes ). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually. If the Company or our subsidiaries sell certain assets, we generally must either invest the net cash proceeds from such sale in our business within a certain period of time, use the
proceeds to prepay senior secured debt (see Note 3), or make an offer to purchase a principal amount of the Notes equal to the excess net cash proceeds at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued
and unpaid interest.    Upon a change in control, we may also be required to make an offer to purchase all of the Notes at a
redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon at least 30 days prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the applicable redemption date    The Notes are unsecured
senior obligations of The Gymboree Corporation. The Company s 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Company s obligations under the Notes (see Note 14). The guarantees of the Notes are joint and
several and will terminate upon the following circumstances: (A) the sale, exchange, disposition or transfer (by merger or otherwise) of (x) the capital stock of the guarantor providing the applicable guarantee, if after such sale,
exchange, disposition or transfer such guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of The Gymboree Corporation, or (y) all or substantially all of the assets of such guarantor, (B) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such guarantor of the
other indebtedness which resulted in the creation of the subsidiary guarantee by such guarantor under the Indenture, (C) the designation of such guarantor as an  unrestricted subsidiary  under the Indenture or (D) the legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, in each such case specified in clauses (A) through (D) above in accordance with the requirements therefore set forth in the Indenture.

   Future minimum principal payments on long-term debt   
 Future minimum principal payments on long-term debt, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs of $11.3 million and
accretion of original issue discount ( OID ) of $0.5 million as of October 29, 2016, are as follows (in thousands):      
    7. Sale-Leaseback of Dixon Distribution Center   
 On May 5, 2015, the Company sold its distribution center in Dixon, California for net proceeds of $25.9 million, and
entered into a leaseback of the property from the purchaser for a period of 15 years.    Under the terms of the lease
agreement, the Company is required to maintain a $3.5 million unconditional irrevocable letter of credit that reduces our line-of-credit borrowing base for a period of up to 10 years. Due to the Company s continuing involvement through the
irrevocable letter of credit, the Company has accounted for the sale-leaseback as a financing liability. Payments made by the Company are allocated between interest expense and a reduction to the sale-leaseback financing liability.  
 Payments (including interest) made by the Company related to the sale-leaseback financing liability during the 13 weeks ended
October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 totaled $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The interest portion of the payments was $0.4 and $0.4 million during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015,
respectively.    As of October 29, 2016, future payments on the sale-leaseback financing liability, excluding renewals,
are as follows (in thousands):      
   As of October 29, 2016, the net carrying value of the Dixon distribution center included
in property and equipment on our condensed consolidated balance sheets amounted to $18.4 million.

   8. Derivative Financial Instruments   
 We had the following outstanding derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (U.S. dollars in thousands):  
   
   The interest rate caps mature on December 23, 2016. The forward foreign exchange
contracts mature in less than one year.    In addition to the cash flow hedges above, the Company had one forward foreign
exchange contract with a notional amount of $3.5 million and $1.5 million as of October 29, 2016 and July 30, 2016, respectively, that was not designated as a hedge. There were no forward foreign exchange contracts that were not designated
as hedges as of October 31, 2015.    The tables below present the effect of all of our derivative financial instruments
on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands).

9. Income Taxes   
 As of October 29, 2016, July 30, 2016, and October 31, 2015, unrecognized tax benefits were $6.1 million,
$6.3 million and $7.4 million, respectively. We believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $6.1 million as of October 29, 2016 will decrease by as much as $0.8 million during the next 12 months due
to the resolution of certain tax contingencies and lapses of applicable statutes of limitation.    As of October 29,
2016, July 30, 2016, and October 31, 2015, the total valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $30.2 million, $30.6 million, and $79.3 million, respectively. We establish a valuation allowance when it is  more likely
than not  that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, including prior earnings history, actual earnings
over the previous 12 quarters on a cumulative basis, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. We continue to have a valuation allowance
against all net deferred tax assets in U.S. federal, unitary state, and Australian jurisdictions, excluding indefinite-lived deferred tax assets and liabilities. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists
to support its reversal.

   10. Commitments and Contingencies   
  Commitments     There have
been no significant changes to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as disclosed in our Transition Report on Form 10-K as of July 30, 2016 (see Notes 7, 11 and 14), other than those which occur in the normal course of
business, except as follows.    On December 1, 2016, the Company entered into a sublease agreement for approximately
80,000 square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. The Company expects to use the subleased premises as its new corporate headquarters. The sublease is expected to commence on or before April 1, 2017 and will expire on
July 15, 2022, subject to the Company s option to extend the sublease until July 15, 2025, if it meets certain performance criteria. The total minimum base rent during the lease term, excluding the extension period of 3 years, is
approximately $20.0 million. In addition, the Company has delivered a security deposit to the sublessor in the form of two letters of credit aggregating $5.7 million to guarantee payment of the Company s rent obligations and to cover payment
for any damages in the event a termination fee is triggered pursuant to the sublease agreement.     Contingencies   
 From time to time, we are subject to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these legal
actions raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to uncertainties. We cannot predict with reasonable assurance the outcome of these legal actions brought against us. Accordingly, any settlements or resolutions in these legal actions
may occur and affect our net income in the quarter of such settlement or resolution. However, we do not believe the outcome of any legal actions would have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

12. Related Party Transactions   
 We incurred approximately $0.8 million and $0.5 million in management fees and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses to Bain
Capital Private Equity, LP ( Bain Capital ) during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. As of October 29, 2016, July 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, we had a payable balance
of $1.7 million, $1.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively, to Bain Capital. Management fees payable to Bain Capital as of October 29, 2016 and July 30, 2016 include approximately $1.3 million fees arising from the sale of Gymboree
Play   Music on July 15, 2016 (see Note 3).    We incurred approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million in
expenses related to services purchased from LogicSource, a company owned by funds associated with Bain Capital, during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. As of October 29, 2016 and October 31,
2015, we had a payable balance of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, to LogicSource. We had no payable to LogicSource as of July 30, 2016.  
 As of October 29, 2016, July 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, we had a receivable balance of $0.4 million,
$0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, from our indirect parent, Giraffe Holding, Inc., which relates primarily to income taxes and withholding taxes.  
  13. Segment Information   
 As of October 29, 2016, our reportable segments include (1) retail stores (including online stores) and
(2) International Retail Franchise ( Retail Franchise ). On July 15, 2016, the Company sold its Gymboree Play   Music segment and Gymboree Investment Holdings L.P. sold Gymboree Tianjin and Gymboree China, which were
previously included under  VIEs  in our segment disclosure. The results of Gymboree Play   Music and Gymboree Tianjin are presented as discontinued operations during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015, while Gymboree China
was deconsolidated as of July 15, 2016, the date of sale (see Note 3).    Our reportable segments were identified based
on how our business is managed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker, who is the Chief Executive Officer. The retail stores segment includes four operating segments (brands), which sell high-quality apparel for children: Gymboree
Retail (including an online store), Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack (including an online store), and Crazy 8 (including an online store). These four operating segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment because these operating segments
have similar historical economic characteristics and/or are expected to have similar economic characteristics and similar long-term financial performance in the future. Gross profit is the principal measure we consider in
 
      18  

Table of Contents  

determining whether the economic characteristics are similar. In addition, each retail store segment has similar products, production processes and type and class of customer. Corporate overhead
(costs related to our distribution centers and shared corporate services) is included in the retail stores segment.    Net
sales and gross profit of each reportable segment were as follows for the periods ended (in thousands):      
   Net retail sales of the retail stores segment by brand and VIE (Gymboree China) were as

 The Company s 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Notes, subject to the
customary automatic release provisions described above (see Note 6). The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), financial position and cash flows of The Gymboree
Corporation and the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries. The VIE financial results are included in those of the non-guarantor subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.

   The Company and its guarantor subsidiaries participate in a cash pooling program. As part of
this program, cash balances are generally swept on a daily basis between the guarantor subsidiary bank accounts and those of the Company. In addition, we pay expenses on behalf of our guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries on a regular basis.
These types of transactions have been accounted for as intercompany transfers within investing and financing activities.  
 The Company s transactions include interest, tax payments and intercompany sales transactions related to administrative
costs incurred by the Company, which are billed to guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries on a cost plus basis. All intercompany transactions are presumed to be settled in cash and therefore are included in operating activities. Non-operating cash
flow changes have been classified as investing and financing activities.

     Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      Forward-Looking Statements   
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain
words such as  believe,   expect,   may,   will,   should,   could,   seek,   intend,   plan,   estimate,  or  anticipate  or similar
expressions. All statements we make relating to: future sales, costs and expenses and gross profit percentages; the continuation of historical trends; our ability to operate our business under our capital and operating structure; and the sufficiency
of our cash balances and cash generated from operating and financing activities for future liquidity and capital resource needs are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change
at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we had expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While
we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results.  
 Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations ( cautionary
statements ) are disclosed under  Item 1A, Risk Factors,  in this Form 10-Q and in our Transition Report on Form 10-K for the 26 weeks ended July 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28,
2016 (the  Fiscal 2016 Transition Report ). We encourage you to read these risk factor disclosures carefully. We caution investors not to place substantial reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report.
These statements, like all statements in this quarterly report, speak only as of the date of this quarterly report (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future developments.
    Overview     We are
one of the largest children s apparel specialty retailers in North America, offering collections of high-quality apparel and accessories. As of October 29, 2016, we operated a total of 1,300 retail stores, as follows:  
   
   As of October 29, 2016, we also operated online stores at www.gymboree.com,
www.janieandjack.com and www.crazy8.com. Overseas franchisees operated 53 retail stores in the Middle East, South Korea and Latin America as follows as of October 29, 2016:

On July 15, 2016, we sold the Gymboree Play   Music business to Zeavion Holding
Pte. Ltd. ( Zeavion ). Concurrent with the sale of Gymboree Play   Music, Gymboree Investment Holdings L.P. sold Gymboree (Tianjin) Educational Information Consultation Co. Ltd. ( Gymboree Tianjin ) and Gymboree (China)
Commercial and Trading Co. Ltd. ( Gymboree China ), master franchisee of Gymboree Play   Music and operator of Gymboree retail stores in China, respectively, to Zeavion. Gymboree China s retail locations were closed prior to
being sold to Zeavion.    The sale of Gymboree Play   Music and Gymboree Tianjin was determined to represent a
strategic shift to the Company s business, and therefore, their financial results during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015 are presented as discontinued operations (see Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this quarterly report). Gymboree China was deconsolidated as of July 15, 2016, the date of sale.

   First Quarter 2017 Highlights   
 Total net sales decreased to $279.8 million during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 from $295.5 million during the 13
weeks ended October 31, 2015, a decrease of 5.3% driven primarily by a decrease in retail sales of $13.4 million, primarily attributable to our Gymboree brand, and a decrease in our retail franchise sales of $2.4 million, primarily due to lower
sales to our franchisee in the Middle East region.    Comparable store sales (including online sales) for the 13 weeks ended
October 29, 2016 decreased 5% compared to the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. A new store is included in the comparable store sales calculation after it has been opened for a full 14 fiscal months. A store that is relocated or expanded by
more than 15% square feet is excluded from the comparable store sales calculation and becomes a comparable store after it has been opened for a full 14 fiscal months from the final relocation or the completion of the expansion. Below are the
comparable store sales (including online sales) by brand for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015:      
   Our loss from continuing operations, net of tax, decreased to $10.9 million during the 13
weeks ended October 29, 2016 from $13.0 million during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. Our Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (see Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted
EBITDA ) (Non-GAAP Measure) below) decreased to $17.8 million during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 from $26.5 million during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015, a decrease of $8.7 million or 32.7%, primarily due to a 5%
decrease in comparable store sales.    The following table summarizes store openings and closures by brand and country
during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016. Note that (i) all Crazy 8 stores are in the United States and (ii) retail stores operated by overseas franchisees are excluded.  
   
    Seasonality   
 Our business is impacted by the timing of certain holidays and key retail shopping periods in the apparel and retail
industries, which generally result in higher sales during the first half of the fiscal year and lower sales during the second half of the fiscal year. Consequently, the results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the
full year.

 Total net sales during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased to $279.8 million from $295.5 million during the 13
weeks ended October 31, 2015, a decrease of $15.7 million or 5.3%.    Net retail sales during the 13 weeks ended
October 29, 2016 decreased to $276.3 million from $289.7 million during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015, a decrease of $13.4 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales (including online sales) of 5% and net
store closures. Comparable store sales (excluding online sales) decreased by 6% during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The 5% decrease in comparable store sales (including online sales)
was primarily attributable to our Gymboree brand followed by our Crazy 8 brand, offset by an increase in comparable stores sales by our Janie and Jack brand. We believe that the decrease in sales of our Gymboree and Crazy 8 brands was driven
primarily by softer traffic trends. We believe that the increase in sales of our Janie and Jack brand was driven primarily by stronger web performance. Total net stores decreased to 1,300 as of October 29, 2016 from 1,315 as of October 31,
2015. Total square footage was approximately 2.7 million square feet as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015.  
 Retail franchise net sales during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased to $3.5 million from $5.9 million
during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015, a decrease of $2.4 million or 40.1%, primarily due to lower sales to our franchisee in the Middle East region. As of October 29, 2016, our overseas franchisees operated 53 stores compared to 90
stores (including 32 in China) as of October 31, 2015.     Gross Profit   
 Gross profit during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased to $107.0 million from $114.9 million during the 13
weeks ended October 31, 2015, primarily driven by a decrease in comparable store sales. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased by 70 basis points to 38.2% from 38.9% during the 13
weeks ended October 31, 2015. The 70 basis point decrease was driven primarily by higher cost of goods sold ( COGS ) as a percentage of sales due to the mix of inventory sold, combined with higher buying and occupancy costs as a
percentage of sales. As we record certain distribution costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) and do not include such costs in COGS, our COGS and gross profit may not be comparable to those of
other companies. Our distribution costs recorded in SG A expenses represent primarily outbound shipping and handling expenses to our stores, and amounted to $10.8 million and $11.3 million during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and
October 31, 2015, respectively.

   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   
 SG A principally consists of non-occupancy store expenses, corporate overhead, and certain distribution expenses. SG A
increased to $105.2 million during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to $105.0 million during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses increased 210 basis points to 37.6% for the 13
weeks ended October 29, 2016 from 35.5% during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015 primarily due to a deleveraging of expenses on lower sales, partially offset by lower marketing expenses as a percentage of sales.  
  Interest Expense   
 Interest expense decreased to $19.9 million during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to $21.9 million for
the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The net decrease of $2.0 million was primarily related to the decrease in our Notes due to repurchases during the first half of fiscal 2016 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, offset by amortization of
our interest rate caps and an increase in ABL borrowings.     Income Taxes   
 The effective tax rate during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 2015 was 39.3% (benefit) and
6.9% (expense), respectively. The change in effective tax rate resulted from our ability to benefit the current quarter s loss against the income tax payable established in fiscal 2016.  
  Financial Condition      Liquidity and Capital Resources
      Overview    
 We finance our business with existing cash, cash from operations and the funds available under our Senior Credit Facilities,
which were comprised of an $820 million secured term loan agreement ( Term Loan ), a $225 million asset-backed revolving credit facility ( ABL Facility ), and $50 million ABL Term loan (see Note 6 to the condensed consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report). We had cash and cash equivalents of $9.7 million, $12.6 million, and $17.3 million as of October 29, 2016, July 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.  
 Net working capital as of October 29, 2016, July 30, 2016, October 31, 2015 totaled $2.9 million,
$4.4 million and $30.8 million, respectively. Net working capital as of October 29, 2016 includes $27.5 million of restricted cash which is expected to be used to pay estimated income taxes associated with the gain on the sale of the Gymboree
Play   Music business included in accrued and other current liabilities. Our operations are seasonal in nature, with sales from retail operations peaking during the quarter ending in January, primarily during the holiday season in November
and December.    Approximately $109.9 million of the net proceeds received from the July 15, 2016 sale of Gymboree
Play   Music are restricted to reduce the Term Loan, fund capital expenditures or investments in other assets with respect to which the Term Loan lenders would have a first priority security interest or pay income taxes associated with the
gain on the sale of GPPI (see Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report). During the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, the Company used $10.7 million of restricted cash to fund capital
expenditures and pay income taxes associated with the gain of GPPI. As of October 29, 2016, the Company had a restricted cash balance remaining of $96.3 million.  
 We and our subsidiaries, and our affiliates, may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through
cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual
restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.    We believe that cash generated by operations, the
remaining funds available under our Senior Credit Facilities and existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, service our debt, and finance capital expenditures over the next 12 months. However, if we
face unanticipated cash needs such as the funding of a capital investment, or if our suppliers request one or more letters of credit, our existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings may be insufficient. In addition, we do not expect
our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under the Senior Credit Facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness when due (including $49.4 million of ABL
Term Loan due in December 2017, $769.1 million of Term Loan due in February 2018, and  
      30  

Table of Contents  

$171.0 million of Senior Notes due in December 2018), or to fund other liquidity needs. We also regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and various financing alternatives for
opportunities to enhance our capital structure. We are continuing to actively pursue various financing alternatives, including refinancing and/or repurchasing our outstanding Senior Notes, incurring additional indebtedness, as well as other
opportunities to improve our capital structure. If opportunities are favorable, we may consummate one or more of these initiatives and the amounts involved may be material.  
   Cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities    
 Net cash used in operating activities during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 was $45.5 million compared to net cash
provided by operating activities of $25.6 million during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015.    The change in
cash flows from operating activities during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 was primarily due to a $7.3 million decrease in merchandise inventories due to timing of purchases, and a $13.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other
assets and a $40.4 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued and other current liabilities due to timing of payments.      Cash
flows provided by (used in) investing activities      Net cash provided by investing activities during the 13 weeks
ended October 29, 2016 was $5.2 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.2 million during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015.  
 The net change during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in restricted cash by $10.7
million, offset by capital expenditures which increased to $5.5 million compared to $5.1 million during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015.  
   Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities    
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 was $37.3 million compared to net
cash used in financing activities of $21.6 million during the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015.    The net change during
the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 was primarily due to increase in line of credit borrowings.      Credit Facilities    
   ABL Facility    
 Our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility ( ABL Revolving Facility ) matures on the earlier of
(i) September 24, 2020 and (ii) the date that is 60 days before the scheduled final maturity date of any tranche of the Term Loan (which is currently due to mature in February 2018) or the Notes (which are currently due to mature in
December 2018), unless such indebtedness is cumulatively equal to or less than $25.0 million in the aggregate and a reserve against the borrowing base is imposed equal to the amount of such indebtedness. The ABL revolving commitment will therefore
mature in December 2017 unless the Term Loan and the Notes (other than an aggregate amount of Term Loans and Notes that is equal to or less than $25.0 million) are refinanced with indebtedness having a final maturity date later than February 2018.
   The ABL Revolving Facility provides for financing of up to $225 million in a revolving line of credit. Line of
credit availability under the ABL Revolving Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of certain assets of the Company, any subsidiary co-borrowers and any subsidiary guarantors that are available to collateralize the borrowings thereunder,
and is reduced by the level of outstanding letters of credit and the outstanding amount of the ABL Term Loan. The line of credit available under the ABL Revolving Facility was reduced by letter of credit utilization totaling $30.8 million as of
October 29, 2016. Undrawn line of credit availability under the ABL Revolving Facility, after being reduced by outstanding line of credit borrowings, letter of credit utilization and outstanding balance of ABL Term Loan, was $114.2 million as
of October 29, 2016, subject to a minimum amount of combined availability and availability. Our undrawn line of credit availability, net of the minimum amount of combined availability and availability, was approximately $92.0 million as of
October 29, 2016. We anticipate utilizing our line of credit under the ABL Revolving Facility throughout the course of fiscal 2017 to support seasonal working capital needs.  
 Line of credit borrowings under the ABL Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either
(a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S.
dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%, or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing
adjusted for certain additional costs ( Adjusted LIBOR ), in each case plus an applicable margin. As of October 29, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on our line of credit borrowings outstanding under the ABL Revolving Facility
was 2.8%. In addition to paying interest on outstanding line of credit borrowings under the ABL Revolving Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on unutilized commitments thereunder, which is between 0.250% and 0.375% per annum.

  The ABL Facility contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our
ability to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. It requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a minimum amount of  Combined Availability  and  Availability  for as long as the ABL Term Loan
remains outstanding.  Combined Availability  is equal to (a) the ABL Term Loan borrowing base minus (b) the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the ABL Facility (including the ABL Term Loan, revolving line of
credit borrowings and letter of credit utilization).  Availability  is equal to the lesser of (A) (I) the revolving credit ceiling (which as of October 29, 2016 was $225.0 million) minus (II) the aggregate principal amount
outstanding under the revolving line of credit and letter of credit utilization and (B) (I) the revolving line of credit borrowing base minus (II) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit and letter of
credit utilization. Under the new availability covenant, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries must maintain (i) Combined Availability in excess of the greater of (x) $17.5 million and (y) 10% of the ABL Term Loan borrowing
base; and (ii) Availability in excess of the greater of (X) $17.5 million and (Y) 10% of the lesser of (1) the applicable revolving line of credit borrowing base and (2) the revolving credit ceiling. The ABL Facility also
contains a financial covenant (i.e., minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio), but such financial covenant is not required to be tested as long as the Company s ABL Term Loan remains outstanding. As of October 29, 2016, we were
not required to test compliance with this covenant. The Second Amendment also provided the agent for the ABL Term Loan and the ABL Term Loan lenders with certain consent rights to amendments relating to, among other terms and provisions, the
borrowing bases, the availability covenant and certain negative covenants. Apart from the new availability covenant and the change to the financial covenant described above, the other material affirmative and negative covenants and events of default
under the ABL Facility were substantially unchanged by the Second Amendment. Failure to maintain the minimum levels of Combined Availability and Availability required by this covenant would result in an event of default under the ABL Facility.  
 In addition, the ABL Facility provides that if the lesser of (i) Combined Availability and (ii) Availability falls
below the greater of (x) $22.5 million and (y) 12.5% of the lesser of (A) the applicable revolving line of credit borrowing base and (B) the revolving credit ceiling (the  Cash Dominion Threshold ) for 5 consecutive
business days, the agent for the ABL lenders may, subject to certain exceptions, take control of the Company s bank accounts and apply the funds therein to pay down the Company s obligations under the ABL Facility. The Company would regain
control of its bank accounts (a  Cash Dominion Cure ) once the lesser of (i) Combined Availability and (ii) Availability had exceeded the Cash Dominion Threshold for 30 consecutive days, provided that the ABL Facility permits no
more than three Cash Dominion Cures in any rolling 365-day period.    The obligations under the ABL Facility are secured,
subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of our assets. Our 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed our obligations under the ABL Facility.  
   ABL Term Loan    
 On April 22, 2016, we entered into an agreement that provides for a senior secured term loan (the  ABL Term
Loan  and together with the ABL Revolving Facility, the  ABL Facility ) of $50.0 million, subject to a borrowing base, the proceeds of which may be used to finance the acquisition of working capital assets, including the purchase of
inventory and equipment, in each case in the ordinary course of business, to finance capital expenditures, to finance permitted acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of the Notes. The maturity date of the ABL Term
Loan is the same as the maturity date of the ABL Revolving Facility. The ABL Term Loan totaled $49.4 million as of October 29, 2016.  
 The ABL Term Loan bears interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a
90-day LIBOR contract rate as determined by the agent for the ABL Term Loan monthly on the first day of each calendar month, plus 10.25% per annum, or, in certain circumstances, at the prime rate, plus 9.25% per annum. Interest is payable
monthly. As of October 29, 2016, the interest rate under our ABL Term Loan was 11.1%.    The ABL Term Loan requires us
to make quarterly payments equal to $0.6 million, with the balance due on the maturity of the ABL Term Loan, which is the same as the maturity date of the ABL line of credit commitment.  
 The obligations under the ABL Term Loan are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of our assets and
those of our 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries. Our 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries also have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Company s obligations under the ABL Term Loan.

    Term Loan    
 We also have an agreement with several lenders for an $820 million senior secured Term Loan, with a maturity date of
February 2018. As of October 29, 2016, $769.1 million was outstanding under the Term Loan. The interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan is, at the Company s option, a base rate plus an additional marginal rate of 2.5% or the
Adjusted LIBOR rate (with a 1.5% floor) plus an additional rate of 3.5%. As of October 29, 2016, the interest rate under our Term Loan was 5%.  
 The Term Loan requires us to make quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the original $820 million principal amount of the Term
Loan made on the closing date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, with the balance due in February 2018. The Term Loan also has mandatory and voluntary pre-payment provisions, including a requirement that we prepay the Term Loan with a certain
percentage of our annual excess cash flow. We calculated our excess cash flow using the 26-week transition period ended July 30, 2016 operating results and concluded we are not required to make any excess cash flow payments on the Term Loan
during fiscal 2016. Voluntary prepayments and the excess cash flow prepayments made in prior fiscal years were applied toward our remaining quarterly amortization payments payable under the Term Loan through fiscal 2017. Our next quarterly payment
payable under the Term Loan is due in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.    The obligations under the Term Loan are secured,
subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of our assets and those of our 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries. Our 100%-owned domestic subsidiaries also have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Company s obligations under the Term
Loan.      Senior Notes    
 In fiscal 2010, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 9.125% Notes due in December 2018. Interest on the
Notes is payable semi-annually. As of October 29, 2016, the Notes payable balance outstanding was $171.0 million (see Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report).  
  Critical Accounting Policies   
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates affecting the application of those
policies since our Fiscal 2016 Transition Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2016.     Adjusted
Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ) (Non-GAAP Measure)     In
the table below, we present Adjusted EBITDA (which is defined as net loss attributable to The Gymboree Corporation before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) adjusted for the other items
described below), which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. We present Adjusted EBITDA in this quarterly report because we consider it an important supplemental measure of performance used by management and we believe it is frequently used
by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the retail industry. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated in substantially the same manner as  EBITDA  under the indenture governing the Notes and
 Consolidated EBITDA  under the agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities. We believe the inclusion of supplementary adjustments applied to EBITDA in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to
investors about certain non-cash items and to provide additional information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service and to comply with various covenants in documents governing our indebtedness. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a
presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in the retail industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income (loss), as a measure of
operating performance or cash flow, or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For
example, Adjusted EBITDA:      

does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;         

does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;     

does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments, on our debt;         

excludes income tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; and     

does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of
ongoing operations.

      Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
   Foreign Currency Risk    
 We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with respect to certain purchases in United States dollars of inventory to be
sold in our retail stores in Canada. The purpose of these contracts is to protect our margins on the eventual sale of the inventory from fluctuations in the exchange rate for Canadian and U.S. dollars. The term of the forward exchange contracts
is generally less than one year. Our U.S. entity also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts with respect to short-term intercompany balances between our Canadian and U.S. entities. The purpose of these contracts is to protect us from
fluctuations in the exchange rate for Canadian and U.S. dollars upon the settlement of such balances.  
      34  

Table of Contents  

  The table below summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of our forward
foreign exchange contracts in U.S. dollars (in thousands except weighted-average rate data):      
     Interest Rate Risk    
 We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt. Our principal interest rate risk relates to the
Term Loan outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities. As of October 29, 2016, we had $769.1 million outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities, bearing interest at variable rates. The interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan is,
at our option, a base rate plus an additional marginal rate of 2.5% or the Adjusted LIBOR rate (with a 1.5% floor) plus an additional rate of 3.5%. As of October 29, 2016, the interest rate under our Term Loan was 5.0%. A 0.125% increase in the
Adjusted LIBOR rate, above the 1.5% floor, would have increased annual interest expense by approximately $1.0 million, assuming $769.1 million of indebtedness thereunder was outstanding for the whole year. The Term Loan allows us to request
additional tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, provided that such amount will be subject to reduction by the amount of any additional commitments incurred
under the ABL Facility (see Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report). No incremental facilities are currently in effect.  
 In December 2010, we purchased four interest rate caps to hedge against rising interest rates associated with our senior
secured term loan above the 5% strike rate of the caps through December 23, 2016, the maturity date of the caps. The notional amount of these caps is $700 million.  
 As of October 29, 2016, July 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, accumulated other comprehensive loss (before
income tax) included approximately $0.7 million, $2.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively, in unrealized losses related to the interest rate caps and forward foreign exchange contracts.  
    Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 The Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human
error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based on the Company s
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information relating to the
Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms. In addition, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the end of the period covered by this report that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are
also effective to ensure information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    
 During the Company s first quarter of fiscal 2017, there was no change in the Company s internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

    Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
 The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Our management does
not expect that the results of any of these legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
    Item 1A. RISK FACTORS   
 There have been no material changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the risk factors

2) 
   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a

a) 
   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be

being prepared;         

b) 
   Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial

a) 
   All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
