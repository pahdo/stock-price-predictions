Organization, Operations and Basis of Presentation      

Guaranty Bancorp is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and headquartered in Colorado.  

The Company s principal business is to serve as a holding company for its bank subsidiary, Guaranty Bank and Trust Company, referred to as the  Bank . 

References to  Company,   us,   we,  and  our  refer to Guaranty Bancorp on a consolidated basis. References to  Guaranty Bancorp  or to the  holding company  refer to the parent company on a stand-alone basis.  

The Bank is a full-service community bank offering an array of banking products and services to the communities it serves along the Front Range of Colorado including: accepting time and demand deposits, originating commercial loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, Small Business Administration ( SBA ) guaranteed loans and consumer loans. The Bank, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries Private Capital Management, LLC ( PCM ) and Cherry Hills Investment Advisors, Inc. ( CHIA ), provide  s   wealth management services, including private banking, investment management and trust services. Substantially all of the Bank s loans are secured by specific items of collateral, including business assets, commercial and residential real estate, which include land or improved land and consumer assets. Commercial loans are generally expected to be repaid from cash flow from the operations of businesses that have taken out the loans. There are no significant concentrations of loans to any one industry or customer.   On September 8, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced transaction with Home State Bancorp ( Home State ) in exchange for a combination of Company stock and cash.  Based in Loveland, Colorado Home State serves the banking needs of businesses and consumer customers in northern Colorado.  

(a)    Basis of Presentation  

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company s financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date of financial statement issuance. 

Certain information and note disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America, have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). The interim operating results presented in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full year. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

(b)    Business Combinations  

The Company accounts for acquisitions of businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair value upon the date of acquisition. Management utilizes various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any excess of purchase price over amounts allocated to the acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.  

(c)      Use of Estimates  

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of  

8   

Table of Contents  

the dates of the consolidated balance sheets and income and expense for the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  

(  d  )    Loans and Loan Commitments 

The Company s loan portfolio includes originated and purchased loans.   The Company extends commercial, real estate, agricultural and consumer loans to customers. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio consists of commercial and real estate loans made to borrowers located throughout the Front Range of Colorado. The ability of the Company s borrowers to honor their contracts is generally dependent upon the real estate and general economic conditions prevailing in Colorado, among other factors.  

Originated and purchased loans for which there was no evidence of credit deterioration upon acquisition and for which collection of all contractually required payments upon acquisition was considered probable are referred to collectively as non-purchased credit impaired loans, or  Non-PCI  loans. Purchased loans for which there was at the acquisition date evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which collection of all contractually required payments was not probable were designated as and referred to as purchased credit impaired or  PCI  loans. In the September 8, 2016 transaction with Home State  ,   the Company designated   $2,108,000     of   loans as PCI.  

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances, adjusted for charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses  , acquisition-related discount   and any deferred fees or costs.   Acquired loans are recorded upon acquisition at fair value, with no associated allowance for loan loss.   However, if subsequent to acquisition the credit quality of an acquired loan deteriorates, an allowance may be required  .    Accounting for loans is performed consistently across all portfolio segments and classes. 

A portfolio segment is defined in accounting guidance as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its allowance for loan losses. A class is defined in accounting guidance as a group of loans having similar initial measurement attributes, risk characteristics and methods for monitoring and assessing risk. 

Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance of the Company s loans. Loan origination fees, net of direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the related loan yield using the effective interest method without anticipating prepayments.   Purchase discount or premium on acquired, Non-PCI loans is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of such loans using the effective interest method  ,   or taken into income when the related loans are paid off or sold. With respect to PCI loans, the  accretable yield   ,   calculated as the excess of undiscounted expected cash flows at acquisition over the fair value at acquisition  ,   is accreted into income over the term of the loan assuming the amount and timing of cash flows are reasonably estimable.  

The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued (and the loan is put on nonaccrual status) at the time the loan is   90   days past due unless the loan is well secured and in process of collection. The time at which a loan enters past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off prior to the date on which they would otherwise enter past due status if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. The interest on a nonaccrual loan is accounted for using the   cost-recovery or   cash-basis method until the loan qualifies for a return to the accrual  -  basis method  . Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero,   with payments received being applied first to the principal balance of the loan. Under the cash-basis method, interest income is recognized when the payment is received in cash. A loan is returned to accrual status after the delinquent borrower s financial condition has improved, when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and when the likelihood of the borrower making future timely payments is reasonably a  ssured. 

Financial instruments include off   balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount of each item represents   the Company s   total exposure to loss with respect to the item before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.

(  e  )    Allowance for Loan Losses and Allowance for Unfunded Commitments 

The allowance for loan losses, or  the allowance , is a valuation allowance for probable incurred loan losses and is reported as a reduction of outstanding loan balances. 

Management evaluates the amount of the allowance on a regular basis based upon its periodic review of the collectability of the Company s loans. Factors affecting the collectability of the loans include the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers  ability to repay, estimated val  ue of any underlying collateral,   prevailing economic conditions   and   historical loss experience  .    This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Management maintains the allowance at a level that it deems appropriate to adequately provide for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit. The Company s methodology for estimating the allowance is consistent across all portfolio segments and classes of loans. 

Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance. The Company s loan portfolio primarily consists of non-homogeneous commercial and real estate loans where charge-offs are considered on a loan-by-loan basis based on the facts and circumstances, including management s evaluation of collateral values in comparison to book values on collateral-dependent loans. Charge-offs on smaller balance unsecured homogenous type loans, such as overdrafts and ready reserves, are recognized by the time the loan in question is   90   days past due. The provision for loan losses and recoveries on loans previously charged-off are added to the allowance. 

The allowance consists of both specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. All loans are subject to individual impairment evaluation should the pertinent facts and circumstances suggest that such evaluation is necessary. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include the loan s payment status and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when they become due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the original underlying loan agreement.     Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. If a loan is impaired, a portion, if any, of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s original contractual rate or at the fair value of collateral, less estimated selling costs, if repayment is expected solely from collateral.   Troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) are separately identified for impairment disclosures. If a TDR is considered to be a collateral-dependent loan,   impairment of the loan   is   measured     using   the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs. Likewise, if a TDR is not collateral-dependent, impairment is measured   using   the present value of estimated future cash flows   discounted by   the loan s effective rate at inception. For TDRs that subsequently default, the Company determines the amount of reserve in accordance with its accounting policy for the allowance. 

The general component of the allowance covers   originated   loans not specifically identified as impaired and is   determined by   calculat  ing   losses recognized by portfolio segment during the current credit cycle and adjusted based on management s evaluation of various qualitative factors.     In performing this calculation, loans are aggregated into one of   three   portfolio segments: Real Estate, Consumer and Commercial   Other. An assessment of risks impacting loans in each of these portfolio segments is performed and qualitative adjustment factors, which   will   adjust the historical loss rate  , are estimated  . These qualitative adjustment factors consider current conditions relative to conditions present throughout the current credit cycle in the following areas: credit quality, loan class concentration levels, economic conditions, loan growth dynamics and organizational conditions.   The h  istorical loss   experience is   adjusted   for   management s estimate of the impact of these factors   based on the   risks present for each portfolio segment. 

The Company recognizes a liability in relation to unfunded commitments that is intended to represent the estimated future losses on commitments. In calculating the amount of this liability, management considers the amount of the Company s off-balance sheet   commitments, estimated utilization factors and loan specific  

10   

Table of Contents  

risk factors. The Company s liability for unfunded commitments is calculated quarterly and   the liability   is included under  other liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheet. 

(f)    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill was recorded in the transaction with Home State on September 8, 2016 and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and l  iabilities. Goodwill is assessed   at least annually for impairment and any such impairment is recognized in the period identified.  

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and evaluated for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that such an evaluation is necessary. 

Core deposit intangible assets ( CDI assets ) are recognized at the time of their acquisition based on valuations prepared by independent third parties or other estimates of fair value. In preparing such valuations, management considers variables such as deposit servicing costs, attrition rates and market discount rates. CDI assets are amortized to expense over their useful lives, ranging from   10   years to   15   years. 

Customer relationship intangible assets are recognized at the time of their acquisition based upon management s estimate of their fair value. In preparing their valuation, management considers variables such as growth in existing customer base, attrition rates and market discount rates. The c  ustomer relationship intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life, which has been estimated to be   10   years. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had recognized   t  hree   customer relationship intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of PCM on July 31, 2012, CHIA on July 16, 2014 and Home State Bancorp ( Home State ) on September 8, 2016.  

(  g  )    Derivative Instruments  

The Company records all derivatives on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value.   At the inception of a derivative contract, the Company designates the derivative as one of   three   types based on the Company s intentions and belief as to the derivative s likely effectiveness as a hedge. These three types are (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair value hedge ), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow hedge ), or (3) an instrument with no hedging designation ( stand-alone derivative ). To date, the Company has entered into cash flow hedges and stand-alone derivative agreements but has not entered into any fair value hedges. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged transaction impacts earnings. Any portion of the cash flow hedge not deemed highly effective in hedging the changes in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported currently in earnings as noninterest income. 

The Company formally documents the relationship between derivatives and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and the strategy for undertaking hedge transactions, at the inception of the derivative contract. This documentation includes linking cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. 

(  h  )    Stock Incentive Plan 

The Company s Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Incentive Plan ) provided for the grant of equity-based awards representing up to a total of   1,700,000   shares of voting common stock to key employees, nonemployee directors, consultants and prospective employees. The Incentive Plan expired by its terms on April 4, 2015. At the Company s annual meeting of stockholders on May 5, 2015, the Company s stockholders approved the Guaranty Bancorp 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ), which had been previously approved by the Company s Board of Directors. The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock awards, stock unit awards, performance stock awards, stock appreciation rights and other  

11   

Table of Contents  

equity-based awards representing up to a total of   935,000   shares of voting common stock to key employees, nonemployee directors, consultants and prospective employees.   All awards issued under the Incentive Plan will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms despite the expiration of the Incentive Plan; however, any awards granted subsequent to the expiration of the Incentive Plan have been, and will continue to be, issued under the 2015 Plan. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had granted stock awards under both the Incentive Plan and the 2015 Plan. The Company recognizes stock compensation expense for services received in a share-based payment transaction over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The compensation cost of employee and director services received in exchange for stock awards is based on the grant date fair value of the award, as determined by quoted market prices. Stock compensation expense is recognized using an estimated forfeiture rate, adjusted as necessary to reflect actual forfeitures. The Company has issued stock awards that vest based on the passage of time over service periods of   one   to   five   years (in some cases vesting in annual installments, in other cases cliff vesting at   the end of the service period)   and other stock awards that vest contingent upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions. The last date on which outstanding performance stock awards may   vest is February 14, 2019.   Compensation cost related to the performance stock awards is recognized based on an evaluation of financial performance in comparison to established criteria.   Should expectations   of future financial performance change, the amount of   expense   recognized in future periods could be impacted. 

(  i  )    Stock Repurchase Plan  

On February   2  , 201  6  , the Company s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the expiration date of the Company s share repurchase program originally announced in April 2014. The repurchase program had been scheduled to expire 12 months from the date of its announcement and, as extended, the program is scheduled to expire on April 2, 201  7  . Pursuant to the program, the Company may repurchase up to   1,000,000   shares of its voting common stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of the date of this filing, the Company had not repurchased any shares under the program. 

(  j  )    Income Taxes 

Income tax expense is the total of the current year s income tax payable or refundable and the increase or decrease in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry     forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date. 

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize some portion of or the entire deferred tax asset. In assessing the Company s likelihood of realizing deferred tax assets, management evaluates both positive and negative evidence, including the existence of any cumulative losses in the current year and the prior two years, the amount of taxes paid in available carry-back years, forecasts of future income, taking into account app  licable tax planning strategies   and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions. Management performs this analysis quarterly and adjusts as necessary. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  , the Company had a net deferred tax asset of   $3,451,000   and     $7,912,000  , respectively, which includes the deferred tax asset   (liability)   associated with the   net unrealized loss   (gain)   on securities   and interest rate swaps.   After analyzing the composition of  ,   and changes in  ,   the deferred tax assets and liabilities and considering the Company s forecasted future taxable income and various tax planning strategies,   including the intent to hold the securities available for sale that were in a loss position until maturity,   management determined that as of   September 30, 2016,   it was  more likely than not  that the net deferred tax asset would be fully realized. As a result, there was   no   valuation allowance with respect to the Company s deferred tax asset as of   September 30, 2016 or December 31,   201  5  .   

The Company and the Bank are subject to U.S. federal income tax and state of Colorado income tax. Generally, the Company is no longer subject to examination by Federal taxing authorities for years before 2012 and is no longer subject to examination by the State for years before 2011. The Company recognizes  

12   

Table of Contents  

interest related to income tax matters as interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as other noninterest expense. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  , the Company did   no  t have any amounts accrued for interest or penalties. 

(k)    Earnings per Common Share 

Basic earnings per common share represents the earnings allocable to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common shares that may be issued by the Company represent unvested stock awards subject to a service or performance condition.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards: 

In April 2015, the FASB issued accounting standards update 2015-03 modifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. The update requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct reduction of debt balances on the balance sheet. For public business entities, the amendments of this update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  As a result of this update the Company has presented debt issuance costs as a reduction of the related debt balance on the Company s Balance Sheet.  

In September 2015, the FASB issued accounting standards update 2015-16 Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. The update requires acquirers to adjust provisional amounts identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined, rather than retrospectively adjusting previously reported information. Additional disclosure of the impact of measurement period adjustments on current year earnings will also be required. For public business entities, the amendments of this update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. This update does not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Recently Issued but not yet Effective Accounting Standards:  

In May 2014, the FASB issued accounting standards update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The main provisions of the update require the identification of performance obligations within a contract and require the recognition of revenue based on a stand-alone allocation of contract revenue to each performance obligation. Performance obligations may be satisfied and revenue recognized over a period of time if: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity s performance as the entity performs, or (ii) the entity s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or (iii) the entity s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The amendments of the update are to be effective for public entities beginning with interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management does not expect the

Table of Contents  

requirements of this update to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

In January 2016, the FASB released accounting standards update 2016-01 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities. The main provisions of the update are to eliminate the available for sale classification of accounting for equity securities and to adjust the fair value disclosures for financial instruments carried at amortized costs such that the disclosed fair values represent an exit price as opposed to an entry price. The provisions of this update will require that equity securities be carried at fair market value on the balance sheet and any periodic changes in value will be adjustments to the income statement. A practical expedient is provided for equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, such that these securities can be carried at cost less any impairment. The provisions of this update become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management does not expect the requirements of this update to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting standards update 2016-02 Leases. The update requires all leases, with the exception of short-term leases that have contractual terms no greater than one year, to be recorded on the balance sheet. Under the provisions of the update, leases classified as operating will be reflected on the balance sheet with the recognition of both a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Under the update, a distinction will exist between finance and operating type leases and the rules for determining which classification a lease will fall into are similar to existing rules. For public business entities, the amendments of this update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The update requires a modified retrospective transition under which comparative balance sheets from the earliest historical period presented will be revised to reflect what the financials would have looked like were the provisions of the update applied consistently in all prior periods. Management is in the process of evaluating the impacts of the update on the Company s financial position and does not expect the requirements of the update to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or cash flows.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued accounting standards update 2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation. The purpose of the update was to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences of such transactions. Under the provisions of the update the income tax consequences of excess tax benefits and deficiencies should be recognized in income tax expense in the reporting period in which the awards vest. Currently, excess tax benefits or deficiencies impact stockholder s equity directly to the extent there is a cumulative excess tax benefit. In the event that a tax deficiency has occurred during the reporting period and a cumulative excess tax benefit does not exist, the tax deficiency is recognized in income tax expense under current GAAP. The update also provides that entities may continue to estimate forfeitures in accounting for stock based compensation or recognize them as they occur. The provisions of this update become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The update requires a modified retrospective transition under which a cumulative effect to equity will be recognized in the period of adoption. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact of the update on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  

In June 2016, the FASB issued accounting standards update 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, commonly referred to as  CECL . The provisions of the update eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold under current GAAP which requires reserves to be based on an incurred loss methodology. Under CECL reserves required for financial assets measured at amortized cost will reflect an organization s estimate of all expected credit losses over the contractual term of the financial asset and thereby require the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate future credit losses. Because CECL encompasses all financial assets carried at amortized cost, the requirement that reserves be established based on an organization s reasonable and supportable estimate of expected credit losses extends to held to maturity ( HTM ) debt securities. Under the provisions of the update credit losses recognized on available for sale ( AFS ) debt securities will be presented as an allowance as opposed to a write-down. In addition, CECL will modify the accounting for purchased loans, with credit deterioration since origination, so that reserves are established at the date of acquisition for purchased loans. Under current GAAP a purchased loan s contractual balance is adjusted to fair value through a credit discount and no reserve is recorded on the purchased loan upon acquisition. Since under CECL reserves will be established for purchased loans at the time of acquisition the accounting for purchased loans is made more comparable to the accounting for originated loans. Finally, increased disclosure requirements under CECL require organizations to present the currently required credit quality disclosures disaggregated by the year of origination or vintage. The FASB expects that the evaluation  

14   

Table of Contents  

of underwriting standards and credit quality trends by financial statement users will be enhanced with the additional vintage disclosures. For public business entities that are SEC filers the amendments of the update will become effective beginning January 1, 2020. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact of CECL on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as well as its required disclosures.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued accounting standards update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flow  s  . The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017; however early adoption is permitted. Management is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the update on the Company s statement of cash flows. 

(  m  )    Reclassifications  

Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have been made to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    

(2  )    Business Combination 

On March 16, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the  Mer  ger Agreement ) with Home State  , a Colorado state chartered bank headqu  artered in Loveland, Colorado   whereby Home State would merge into the Company. The   transaction   closed on September 8, 2016 with an aggregate transaction value of   $152,478,000  .    The Merger Agreement provided that, subject to certain conditions, Home State shareholders would receive   6,533,756   shares of Company voting common stock valued at   $117,477,000   based on the Company s closing stock price on September 8, 2016 of   $17.98  , in addition to   $35,001,000   in cash.    

The Company believes that the   transaction   will enhance its   liquidity and its market share in northern Colorado.     

Home State s results of operations have been included in the Company s results of operatio  ns beginning September 9, 2016,   however, it is impracticable to provide separate information on Home State s revenues and income subsequent to September 8, 2016 due to changes in the consolidated balance sheet.       P  re-tax merger expenses of   $2,205,000   and   $3,227,000     were   included in the Company s results of operations for   the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016.   Of the $2,205,000 in pre-tax merger expenses incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2016,   $1,389,000     was   included in salaries and employee benefits expense, while   $816,000     was   included in other general and administrative expense.  Of the $3,227,000 in pre-tax merger expenses incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2016,   $1,389,000     was   included in salaries and employee benefits expense, while   $1,838,000     was   included in other general and administrative expense.    In addition to merger-related costs recognized as expense  ,   the Company incurred   debt-  issuance and   stock-issuance costs of   $801,000   and   $1,009,000  ,   respectively  ,   as of September 30, 2016.  Debt-issuance   costs   were     recorded   as a reduction to subordinated debentures and stock-issuance costs   were   recorded a  s a   reduction to additional paid in capital on the Company s balance sheet.  

Goodwill of   $56,148,000   was recognized in the transaction and represents expected synergies and cost savings resulting from combining the operations of Home State with the Company. Due to the tax  -  free structure of the   transaction  , goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition is preliminary and pending receipt of final valuations. Additionally, preliminary valuations of Home State s deferred tax assets are subject to adjustment, pending completion of the  stub  period return, covering Home State s operations from January 1, 2016 through September 8, 2016.

Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in t  he September 8, 2016 transaction with   Home State: 

The fair value of net assets acquired includes fair value adjustments to certain loans that were considered impaired as of the acquisition date. The fair value adjustments were determined using discounted expected cash flows. Acquired loans that evidence credit deterioration since origination, for which the acquirer does not expect to collect all contractual cash flows are designated as PCI upon acquisition. The gross contractual amount of loans identified as   PCI   as of the acquisition date totaled   $2,834,000  , however, contractual cash flows not expected to be collected as of acquisition date on these PCI loans totaled   $531,000  , representing   18.7%   of their contractual balance.    Additionally, PCI loans had an interest rate fair value adjustment as of September 8, 2016 of   $195,000   bringing the net fair value to   $2,108,000   as of September 8, 2016.   Cash flows on PCI loans cannot be reliably estimated and as a result these loans have been designated as nonaccrual.   Loans that were not designated PCI at acquisition had a fair value of   $443,423,000   and a contractual balance of   $458,014,000   as of September 8, 2016.   The credit component of the fair value adjustment   on non-PCI loans as of acquisition   totaled     $  8,358,000  , representing   1.8  %   of their contractual balances.   No allowance for loan losses related to acquired loans was brought over as a result of the Home State transaction.   The composition of Home State s portfolio as of September 8, 2016 is detailed in the table below:

The following tables present pro-forma financial information as if the transaction occurred as of January 1, 2015. The pro-forma information includes adjustments for interest income on loans and securities acquired, amortization of intangibles arising from the transaction and the related tax effects. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been adjusted to exclude one-time expenses related to the transaction. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the transactions been effected on January 1, 2015  .

During the first quarter of 2015, the Company reclassified, at fair value, approximately   $49,084,000   in available for sale mortgage-backed, asset-backed and municipal securities to the held to maturity category  , including   related unrealized pre-tax losses of approximately   $750,000  . As of September 30, 2016  ,   unrealized pre-tax losses of   approximately   $575,000   remained   in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will   continue to   be   accreted   over the rem  aining life of the securities  .    No   gains or losses were recognized at the time of reclassification  .   

The carrying amount, unrecognized gains/losses and fair value of securities held to maturity were as follows at the dates presented: 

The proceeds from sales and calls of securities and the associated gains are listed below:

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available for sale and held to maturity debt securities by contractual maturity at   September     30  , 201  6   are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. Securities not due at a single maturity date are presented separately. 

The following tables present the fair value and the unrealized loss on securities that were temporarily impaired as   of   September   30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  , aggregated by major security type and length of time in a continuous unrealized loss position:

The table above presents unrealized losses on held to maturity securities since the date of the securities purchase, independent of the impact associated with changes in cost basis upon transfer from available for sale to held to maturity. 

In determining whether or not there is an other-than-temporary-impairment ( OTTI ) for a security, management considers many factors, including: (i) the length of time for which and the extent to which the security s fair value has been less than cost, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security s issuer, (iii) whether the decline in the security s value was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (iv)     whether the Company intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before a recovery in its fair value. The assessment of whether an OTTI exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a particular point in time.   There   were   no   accumulated credit losses on any of the Company s securities as of   September     30, 2016 or   December 31, 201  5  . 

At   September     30, 2016  ,    there   were   152   individual securities in an unrealized loss position, including   10   individual securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer. Management has evaluated these securities, in addition to the remaining   142   securities in an unrealized loss position, and has   determined that the decline in value since their purchase dates was primarily attributable to fluctuations in market interest rates and does not reflect a decline in the underlying issuers  ability to repay.   The decrease in the number of securities in an unrealized loss position in excess of 12 months from   43   securities at December 31, 2015 to 10   securities   at   September   30  , 2016 was primarily attributable to the timing of interest rate fluctuations   in addition to a restructuring of the investment portfolio immediately following the   transaction   with Home State  . The total number of securities in an unrealized   loss   position increased     from   88   individual   securities at December 31,   2015 to   152 securities   at   September   30, 2016     primarily as a result of the increase in the number of securities as a result of the September 8, 2016   transaction with   Home State  . At   September   30, 2016  , the Company did not intend to sell, and did not consider it likely that it would be required to sell, any of these securities prior to recovery in their fair value. 

The Company s unrated and rated municipal bond securities, along with the Company s other rated investment securities, are subject to an annual internal review process that management has historically performed in the fourth quarter. The review process includes a review of the securities  issuers  most recent financial statements, including an evaluation of the expected sufficiency of the issuers  cash flows relative to their debt service requirements. In addition, management considers any interim information made available to it that would prompt the need for more frequent review. At   September   30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  , the Company s unrated municipal bonds   comprised   approximately   5.3%   and     13.8%  , respectively,   of the carrying value of the Company s entire municipal bond portfolio.  

Certain mortgage backed securities with an aggregate market value of   approximately   $36,105,000   as   of   September   30, 2016 were pledged to secure overnight repurchase agreement borrowings. Fluctuations in the fair  

20   

Table of Contents  

value of these securities, and or the fluctuation in customer repurchase agreement balances, may result in the need to pledge additional securities against these borrowings. Management monitors the Bank s collateral position with respect to repurchase agreement borrowings on a daily basis. The Company also pledges certain securities to public deposits under the Colorado Public Deposit Protection Act and pledges securities as collateral for funding lines. At   September   30,     2016, the Company s total pledged securities   were   $229,337,000  .    

(4  )    Loans  

A summary of net loans held for investment by loan type at the dates indicated is as follows:  

I  n the second and third quarters   of   2016  ,   the Company purchased   $22.7   million and   $2  9.3   million  , respectively,   in performing loans included in our Real Estate portfolio segment. In the third quarter   of   2015  ,   the Company purchased   $20.1   million in performing loans included in our Real Estate portfolio segment. 

Activity in the allowance for loan losses for the period indicated is as follows: 

The Company s additional disclosures relating to loans and the allowance for loan losses are broken out into two subsets  ,   portfolio segment and class. The portfolio segment level   is defined as the level where financing receivables   are aggregated in developing the Company s systematic method for calculating its allowance for loan losses. The class level is the second level at which credit information is presented and represents the categorization of   financing related receivables   at a slightly less aggregated level than the portfolio segment level. Because d  ata presented according to class is dependent upon the underlying purpose of the loan, whereas loan data organized by portfolio segment is determined by the loan s underlying collateral, disclosures broken out by portfolio segment versus class may not be in agreement.   The disclosures in this footnote include both Non-PCI and PCI loans.   As of September 30, 2016 PCI loans acquired in the Home State transaction   are not considered material   and as a result separate PCI disclosures are not included.

The following tables provide detail for the ending balances in the Company s allowance for loan losses and loans held for investment, broken down by portfolio segment as of the dates indicated. In addition, the tables also provide a roll  -  forward by portfolio segment of the allowance for loan losses for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . The detail provided for the amount of the allowance for loan losses and loans individually versus collectively evaluated for impairment (i.e., the specific component versus the general component of the allowance for loan losses) corresponds to the Company s systematic methodology for estimating its allowance for loan losses.

The following tables provide additional detail with respect to impaired loans broken out according to class as of the dates indicated. The recorded investment included in the following table represents customer balances net of any partial charge-offs recognized on the loans  , net of any deferred fees and costs  . The unpaid balance represents the recorded balance prior to any partial charge-offs. Interest income recognized year-to-date may exclude an immaterial amount of interest income on matured loans that are 90 days or more past due, but that are in the process of being renewed and thus are still accruing.

The interest income recognized on impaired loans in the third quarter was   $1,180,000  ;   of this   $969,000   was recognized on impaired loans with no related allowance and   $211,000   was recognized on loans with a related allowance. The majority of the $969,000 was comprised of a   $775,000   interest recovery on a commercial real estate nonaccrual loan in the third quarter 201  6  .    The   gross year-to-date interest income that would have been recorded had the nonaccrual loans been current in accordance with their original terms   was   $209,000   for   the nine   months ended   September   30  , 2016 and $  510,000   for the nine   months   ended   September   30  , 2015.   For the three months ended   September   30, 2016 and   September     30, 2015, gross interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans, had the loans been current in accordance with their original terms, was   approximately   $77,000   and   $171,000   respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   approximately   $83,000   and   $332,000  , respectively, in cash-basis interes  t income was recognized on the C  ompany s largest nonaccrual loan. This loan was moved into accruing status in September 2016.   No   cash-basis interest income   was recognized in the first nine months of 2015.  

The following tables summarize, by class, loans classified as past due in excess of 30 days or more, in addition to those loans classified as nonaccrual:

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of a particular borrower to service its debt, such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit do  cumentation, public information   and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings, which are consistent with the definitions used in supervisory guidance: 

Substandard  .  Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral, if any, pledged to secure the loan. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful  .  Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing f  acts, conditions   and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Loans not meeting the criteria above are considered to be non-classified loans. 

The following tables provide detail for the risk categories of loans, by class of loans, based on the most recent credit analysis performed as of the dates indicated:

The   book balance of   TDRs   at   September 30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015   was $  24,431,000   and $  22,391,000  , respectively. Management established approximately   $310,000   and $  276,000   in specific   reserves with respect to these loans as of   September 30  , 2016 and December     31,     201  5  , respectively.   The Company had   an additional   $1,864,000     and   $953,000   committed on loans classified as TDRs at September 30, 2016 and   December   31,   201  5  ,    respectively.    

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the terms of   three   loans totaling   $4,765,000,   were modified in troubled debt restructurings. The modification of the terms of such loans included t  wo restructurings   of payment terms and one renewal of a loan with a stated interest rate below market.   During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   the repayment terms of a single loan with a balance of   $2,900,0  00   were modified in a troubled debt restructuring.   During the   three and nine   months   ended September 30,   2015 there   were   no     material   modifications of loans designated as TDRs. 

For reporting purposes, a   loan is   considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms. There were   no   defaults on TDRs during the   three and   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016 or     September 30, 2015  . 

(5  )      Goodwill and O  ther Intangible Assets  

The Company recognized   $56,148,000   in goodwill   as a result of the   Home State   transaction   on September 8, 2016. Current estimates of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed are preliminary and subject to change in the twelve months after the   transaction   if subsequently additional information becomes available impacting acquisition date fair values. Subsequent changes to estimates of acquisition date fair value will impact the amount recognized as goodwill.  

Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over   their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. As of   September   30, 2016, the Company had intangible assets comprised of its core deposit intangible assets and customer relationship intangible assets. 

The following table presents the gross amounts of core deposit intangible assets and customer relationship intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization at the dates indicated:  

(  6  )    Borrowings  

At   September   30, 2016, the Company s outstanding borrowings   were $  122,521,000   as   compared to $  280,847,000   at December 31, 2015. These borrowings at   September   30, 2016 consisted   of   $122,521,000   in term notes with the Federal Home Loan Bank (the  FHL  B ).   The Company also maintains a line of credit at the FHLB, however,   it   had   no   outstanding borrowings on the line of credit as of September 30, 2016. At December 31, 201  5, outstanding borrowings consisted of   $95,000,000   of term notes and   $185,847,000   in advances on our line of credit, both with the FHLB. 

The interest rate on the FHLB line of credit varies with the federal funds rate and   was   0.53  % at     September   30, 2016. The Company has   six   term notes with the FHLB.   Four   of the term notes have fixed interest rates, the first a   $20,000,000   term note at   2.52%   that is payable at its matu  rity date of   January 23, 2018  , with a prepayment penalty if paid prior to maturity and is convertible to floating rate on pred  etermined conversion dates at  

27   

Table of Contents  

the discretion of the FHLB.   If the note is converted by the FHLB, the Bank has the option to prepay the note without penalty. If the note is not converted by the FHLB, the note continues to be convertible quarterly thereafter, with the option to convert to floating rate at the discretion of the FHLB. The   second   fixed rate term note of   $50,000,000   carried   an interest rate of   0.63%   and   matured   October 24, 2016   and was not renewed. The remaining   two fixed rate term notes of   $695,000   and   $1,740,000   have maturity dates of   April 10, 2017   and   August 30, 2017  , respectively. The notes were   assumed     in the transaction   with Home State and   have   an unamortized   fair value   premium of approximately   $86,000   as of   September 30, 2016  .     The Company also has   two   variable rate term notes of   $25,000,000   each that mature on   March 7, 2017     and   August 4, 2017   and   have interest rates that reset quarterly, currently set as   1.03%   and 0.87%  ,   respectively. The next rate reset dates on the variable rate term notes are   December 7, 2016   and November   5, 2016  .    

The Company has an advance, pledge and security agreement with the FHLB and had pledged qualifying loans and securities in the amount of   $  831,636  ,000   at     September   30, 2016 and $  454,748,000   at December 31, 2015. The maximum credit allowance for future borrowings, including term notes and advances on the line of credit, was $  709,201,000   at   September   30, 2016 and $  173,901,000   at December 31, 2015.  

In April 2016, the holding company entered into a credit agreement for a   $10,000,000   secured line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The holding company s stock in   the Bank   is pledged as collateral to the line of credit. The line of credit matures on March 17, 2017. Under the credit agreement, we elect a fixed or floating interest rate on each advance. As of   September   30,   2016   no   amounts had been borrowed on the Wells Fargo line of c  redit.  

(7)    Subordinated Debentures and Trust Preferred   Securities  

At   September   30, 2016 the balance of the Company s outstanding subordinated debentures (the  Debentures ) was   $64,973,000  , comprised of   $65,774,000   in debt, partially offset by   $801,000   in debt issuance costs. At December 31, 2015 the balance of the Company s Debentures was $  25,774,000  . As of   September   30, 2016, the Company's Debentures bore a weighted average cost of funds of   4.87%  .   

The Company s Debentures were issued in   three   separate series. The first two issuances have maturities of   30   years from the date of issuance. These two issuances of Debentures were issued to trusts established by the Company, which in turn issued $  25,000,000   of trust preferred securities ( TruPS ). Generally, and with certain limitations, the Company is permitted to call the Debentures subsequent to the first   five   or   ten   years, as applicable, after issuance, if certain conditions are met, or at any time upon the occurrence and continuation of certain changes in either the tax treatment or the capital treatment of the trusts, the Debentures or the preferred securities. The Guaranty Capital Trust III TruPS became callable at each quarterly interest payment date starting on July 7, 2008. The CenBank Trust III TruPS became callable at each quarterly interest payment date starting on April 15, 2009. 

The third issuance was executed on July 18, 2016 in anticipation of the   transaction   with Home State, in order to fund the cash consideration to be paid to Home State shareholders in conjunction with the   transaction  . The issuance was comprised of   $  40,000,000   of   5.75%   Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (the  Notes ) due July 20, 2026.   The Notes will initially bear a fixed interest rate of 5.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. On July 20, 2021, and, thereafter, the interest on the Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears, at an annual floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR as determined by the applicable quarterly period, plus   4.73%  . 

As of   September   30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the Debentures. 

The Company had accrued, unpaid interest on its Debentures of approximately   $698,000   at S  eptember   30, 2016 and approximately   $208,000   at December 31, 2015. Interest payable on Debentures is included in interest payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

The Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts that issued the TruPS (variable interest entities); therefore, the trusts are not consolidated in the Company s financial statements and the Debentures are shown as liabilities. The Company s investment in the common stock of each trust is included in other assets in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 

Although the securities issued by each of the trusts are not included as a component of stockholders  equity in the consolidated balance sheets, they are treated as capital for regulatory purposes. Specifically, under applicable regulatory guidelines, the $25,000,000 of TruPS issued by the trusts qualify as Tier 1 capital, up to a maximum of   25  % of capital on an aggregate basis. Any amount that exceeds   25  % qualifies as Tier 2 capital. At

Table of Contents  

September 30, 2016, the full $  25,000,000   of the TruPS qualified as Tier 1 capital. The   $40,000,000   issuance from July 2016 qualifies for inclusion in Tier 2 capital.  

Under the Dodd-Frank Act and a joint rule from the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC, certain TruPS are no longer eligible to be included as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes. However, an exception to this statutory prohibition applies to securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $  15   billion of total assets. As we have less than $  15   billion in total assets and issued all of our TruPS prior to May 19, 2010, we expect that our TruPS will continue to be eligible to be treated as Tier 1 capital, subject to other rules and limitations. 

The following table summarizes the terms of each outstanding subordinated debenture issuance at   September   30, 2016     (dollars in thousands):  

* Call date represents the earliest or next date the Company can call the debentures. 

** On October 7, 2016  , the rate on the Guaranty Capital Trust   III   subordinated debentures reset to   3.98%  . On October 15, 2016, the rate on the CenBank Trust III subordinated debentures reset to   3.53%  . The subordinated notes issued July 18, 2016 are fixed at   5.75%   until July 20, 2021 at which point the notes turn to floating rate at three-month LIBOR plus   4.73%  .    

(  8  )    Commitments    

The Bank enters into credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. 

The Bank s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Bank follows the same credit policies in making commitments  ,    including obtaining collateral, if necessary  ,    as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. 

At the dates indicated, the following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represented credit risk: 

At   September   30  , 2016  , the rates on the fixed rate commitments to extend credit ranged   from   1.95  % to   7.00  %. 

A commitment to   extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the underlying contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Several of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. 

A commitment to extend credit under an overdraft protection agreement is a commitment for a possible future extension of credit to an existing deposit customer. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Bank is committed.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. A majority of letters of credit issued have expiration dates within   one   year. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank generally holds collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary. 

(  9  )    Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 

Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets. 

Level 2 - Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices   for similar assets   or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset. 

Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Transfers of financial instruments between levels within the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the date management determines that the underlying circumstances or assumptions have changed. 

Fair values of our securities are determined through the utilization of evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available market information (Level 2). The evaluated pricing models apply available information, as applicable, through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare evaluations. These models assess interest rate impact, develop prepayment scenarios and take into account market conventions.   For securities where routine valuation techniques are not used, management utilizes a discounted cash flow model with market-adjusted discount rates or other unobservable inputs to estimate fair value. Due to the lack of ratings available on these securities, management determined that a relationship to other benchmark quoted securities was unobservable  ,   and as a result  ,   these securities should be classified as Level 3 (Level 3 inputs). The valuation of the Company s Level 3 bonds is highly sensitive to changes in unobservable inputs. 

Currently, the Company uses interest rate swaps     to manage interest rate risk. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments (or receipts) and the discounted expected variable cash receipts (or payments). The variable cash receipts (or payments) are based on the expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observed market interest rate curves (Level 2 inputs). The Company considers the value of the swap  s   to be sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The estimated fair values, and related carrying amounts, of the Company s financial instruments are as follows: 

The fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount that would be exchanged between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. 

Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Therefore, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. 

33   

Table of Contents  

The following methods and assumptions are used by the Company in estimating fair value disclosures for financial instruments: 

(a) 

Cash and Cash Equivalents      

The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values (Level 1). 

(b) 

Securities and Bank Stocks     

Fair values for securities available for sale and held to maturity are generally   determined through the utilization of evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available market information (Level 2). The evaluated pricing models apply available information, as applicable, through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of li  ke securities, sector groupings   and matrix pricing to prepare evaluations. These models assess interest rate impact, develop prepayment scenarios and take into account market conventions.   For positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions (i.e., bonds valued with Level 3 inputs), management uses a combination of reviews of the underlying financial statements, appraisals and management s judgment regarding credit quality and intent to sell in order to determine the value of the bond. 

It is not practical to determine the fair value of bank stocks due to restrictions placed on the transferability of FHLB st  ock, Federal Reserve Bank stock,   Bankers  Bank of the West stock   and Pacific Coast Bankers  Bank stock  . These three stocks comprise the majority of the balance of the Company s bank stocks  . 

(c) 

Loans Held for Investment     

For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values (Level 3). Fair values for other loans (e.g., commercial real estate and investment property mortgage loans and commercial loans) are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality (Level     3). Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value when specific reserves are attributed to these loans because the present value of expected cash flows or the net realizable value of collateral is less than the impaired loan s recorded investment. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price. 

(d) 

Loans Held for Sale     

Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, with fair value determined by the sales price agreed upon in negotiation with the purchaser (Level 1). 

(e) 

Deposits      

The fair values of demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-inte  rest checking, passbook savings   and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) (Level 2). The carrying amounts of variable rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date (Level 2). Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits (Level 2). 

(f) 

Short-term Borrowings      

The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings maturing within 90 days approximate their fair values (Level 2). 

34   

Table of Contents  

(g) 

Long-term Borrowings      

The fair values of the Company s long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements (Level 2). 

(h) 

Subordinated Debentures      

Th  e fair values of the Company s   Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements (Level 3). 

(i) 

Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable     

The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value (Level 2). 

(j) 

Interest Rate Swaps, net     

The fair value of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments (or receipts) and the discounted expected variable cash receipts (or payments).     The variable cash receipts (or payments) are based on the expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observed market interest rate curves (Level 2). 

(k) 

Off-balance Sheet Instruments     

Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing. The fair value of commitments is immaterial. 

(10)      Derivatives and Hedging Activities 

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to assist in the management of interest rate risk, primarily helping to secure long  -  term borrowing rates. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment or receipt of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company s known or expected cash payments or receipts principally related to certain variable-rate borrowings. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 

The table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the   consolidated balance sheet as of   September   30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  : 

The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability and predictability to interest expense and to manage the Company s exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. For hedges of the Company s variable-rate borrowings, interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed payments. As of   September   3  0  , 201  6  , the Company had two   forward-starting   interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount  

35   

Table of Contents  

of   $50,000,000   that were designated as cash flow hedges associated with the Company s forecasted variable-rate borrowings.   T  he first   $25,000,000     swap   bec  ame   effective in June 2015 at a fixed rate of   2.46%   and matur  es   in June     2020. The second   $25,000,000   swap bec  a  me effective in March 2016 at a fixed rate of   3.00%     and   matur  es     in   March     2021. 

Summary information about the interest-rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of   September     30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015 is included in the table below: 

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. The Company s cash flow hedges are used to hedge the forecasted variable cash outflows associated with   forecasted issuances of FHLB advances. During the nine months ended   September   30, 2016 and   September     30, 2015  , the income statement effect of hedge ineffectiveness was not material  . 

Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate liabilities.   Management expects that, during the next 12 months  ,     approximately   $909,000   will   be reclassified from AOCI into interest expense  . 

The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with another third-party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. The impact of these customer interest rate swaps on the Company s financial statements was immaterial for   the   periods covered by this report. 

The table below presents the effect of the Company s   derivative financial instruments on both comprehensiv  e income and net income for the three and nine   months   ended   September   30,   2016 and September 30, 2015  : 

The Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a cross-default provision whereby if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. 

The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain o  f its derivative counterparties   and   as of   September   30, 2016 had   posted   $4,690,000   against   its obligations   under these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at   September   30, 2016  , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.

(1  1  )    Stock-Based Compensation 

Under the Company s Incentive Plan, which   expired by its terms on April 4, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors had the authority to grant stock-based compensation awards prior to the plan s expiration. Under the 2015   Plan, which was approved by the Company s stockholders at the May 5, 2015 annual meeting, the Company s Board of Directors maintains the authority to grant stock-based compensation awards to nonemployee directors, key employees, consultants and prospective employees under the terms described in each   of the plans.  

S  tock-based compensation awards   issuable under either plan include the grant   of   stock-based compensation awards in the form of   options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock awards, stock appreciation rights and other equity based awards. Likewise, the Incentive Plan provided for, and the 2015 Plan provides, that eligible participants may be granted shares of Company common stock that are subject to forfeiture until the grantee vests in the stock award based on the established conditions, which may include service conditions, established performance measures or both. 

Prior to the vesting of stock awards that are subject to a service vesting condition, each grantee has the rights of a stockholder with respect to voting the shares of stock represented by the award. The grantee is not entitled to dividend rights with respect to the shares of stock until vesting occurs. Prior to vesting of the stock awards with performance vesting conditions, each grantee has the rights of a stockholder with respect to voting of the shares of stock represented by the award. The recipient is generally not entitled to dividend rights with respect to unvested shares. Other than the stock awards with service and performance-based vesting conditions, no other grants have been made under either the Incentive Plan or the 2015 Plan. 

Under the provisions of the 2015 Plan and the Incentive Plan  ,   grants of stock-based compensation awards of   935,000   and   1,700,000   shares  , respectively, were authorized  , subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. As of   September   30, 2016  , there   were   187,617   and   376  ,759     outstanding   awards under the 2015 Plan and the Incentive Plan  ,   respectively  . As of   September   30, 2016, there   were   7  30,175   shares   remaining available for grant under the 2015 Plan.   Although the Incentive Plan expired by its terms on April 4, 2015, awards previously granted under the Incentive Plan remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.  

Of   the   564,376   shares     represented by   unvested awards at   September   30  , 2016  ,    approximately   542  ,000     shares   are expected to vest. At   September   30  ,   2016   the  re were   31  5  ,031     shares   of restricted stock outstanding that were subject to a performance condition.   As of   September   30, 2016, manage  ment expects that   approximately   304,000   of   these shares will vest and that the remaining shares will expire unvested. The performance shares that are expected to vest relate to awards granted to various key   employees   from February 2014 through   August   2016  . The vesting   of these performance shares is contingent upon the meeting of certain return on asset performance   criteria  . The performance-based shares awarded in 2014  , 2015   and 201  6   each include a  threshold  and  target  performance level, with vesting determined based on where actual performance falls in relation to the numeric range represented by these performance criteria. As   of   September   30  , 2016, management expected that all of the performance awards made in 2014, 2015 and 2016 will vest (  with the exception of    e  stimated   forfeitures), which is consistent with the level of expense currently being recognized over the vesting period. Should this expectation change,   the accrual of compensation expense in future periods could be impacted  . 

A summary of the status of unearned stock awards and the change during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   is presented in the table below: 

The Company   recognized $  2,304,000   and    $  2,094,000   in   stock-based compensation expense for services rendered for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and   September   30, 2015  , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation   arrangements   was   $876,000   and     $796,000   for   the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and   September   30, 2015  , respectively.   The grant date fair value of restricted stock awards granted in the   nine   months ended   September   30  , 2016   and   September   30, 2015   was   $2,963,000     and   $2,391,  000  ,   respectively  .    The fair value of awards that vested in the   nine   months ended   September   30  , 2016   and

(1  3  )      Contingencies 

The Company and the Bank are defendants, from time-to-time, in legal actions at various points of the legal process,   including appeals, a  rising from transactions conducted in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, after consultation with legal counsel, that it is not probable that the outcome of current legal actions will result in a liability that has a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income or cash flows. In the event that such legal action results in an unfavorable outcome, the resulting liability could have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income or cash flows. 

On May 20, 2016, a putative stockholder class action lawsuit (the  Merger Litigation ), was filed against the Company and the individual members of Company s board of directors in connection with the Company entering into the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the  Merger Agreement ). The action,   Sciabacucchi v. Cordes et al.  , Case No. 16cv31793, was filed in Colorado District Court, Denver County. 

The Merger Litigation allege  d   that the members of the Company s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties owed to the Company s stockholders by causing a materially incomplete registration statement to be filed. The plaintiff in the Merger Litigation generally s  ought  , among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief concerning the alleged breach of fiduciary duties, injunctive relief prohibiting consummation of the   transaction   and attorneys  fees and costs, and other further relief. 

On July 5, 2016, the parties to the   merger litigation   entered into a Memorandum of Agreement providing that, among other things: (1) the Company   would   make specified additional disclosures in the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed in connection with the   transaction  ; (2) the merger litigation is stayed; and (3) the parties   would   enter into a stipulation providing for certification of a class for settlement purposes and a class release. The joint proxy statement/prospectus filing filed on July 19, 2016, included these specific additional disclosures. The proposed settlement is subject to, among other things, approval of the District Court, City and County of Denver,

Colorado. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, following final court approval, the action will be dismissed with prejudice.  

On September 9, 2016,   the   parties entered into a Final Stipulation of Settlement and Release filed with the Colorado District Court, Denver County. A copy of the settlement was mailed to all stockholders of record between March 16, 2016 and July 5, 2016 in September 2016. The hearing to approve the settlement is scheduled for January 2017.   There can be no assurances however, that court approval of the settlement will be obtained.    

(1  4  )      Subsequent Events 

On   November 8, 2016  , the Company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.115   per common share. The dividend is payable on   November 28, 2016   to stockholders of record as of close of business on   November 18, 2016  .

Overview 

Guaranty Bancorp is a bank holding company with its principal business to serve as the holding company for its Colorado-based bank subsidiary, Guaranty Bank and Trust Company (the  Bank ). The   Bank is the sole member of several limited liability companies that hold real estate as well as the sole   owner of two investment management   firm  s,   Private Capital Management LLC (     PCM     )   and Cherry Hills Investment Advisors, Inc. ( CHIA   )  .    References to    Company ,  us ,  we    and  our  refer to Guaranty Bancorp on a consolidated basis  . References to  Guaranty Bancorp  or to the  holding company  refer to the parent company on a stand-alone basis. References to the  Bank  refer to Guaranty Bank and Trust Company, our bank subsidiary. 

On March 16, 2016, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Home State, parent company of Home State Bank, a Colorado state chartered bank headquartered in Loveland, Colorado whereby Home State would merge into the Company. The transaction closed on September 8, 2016.  

Through the Bank, we provide banking and other financial services throughout our targeted Colorado markets to small to medium-sized businesses, including the owners and employees of those businesses  ,   and consumers. Our line of banking products and services include accepting demand and time deposits and originating real estate loans (including construction loans), commercial loans, SBA guaranteed loans and consumer loans. The Bank, PCM and CHIA also provide wealth management solutions, including trust and investment management services. We derive our income primarily from interest (including loan origination fees) received on loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities and other fees received in connection with servicing loan and deposit accounts, trust and investment management services. Our major operating expenses include the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We rely primarily on locally generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans  . 

In addition to building growth organically through our existing branches, we seek opportunities to acquire small to medium-sized banks or specialty finance companies that will allow us to expand our franchise in a manner consistent with our community     bank focus. Ideally, the financial institutions we seek to acquire will be in or contiguous to our existing footprint, which would allow us to use the acquisition to consolidate duplicative costs and administrative functions and to rationalize operating expenses. We believe that by streamlining the administrative and operational functions of an acquired financial institution, we are able to substantially lower operating costs, operate more efficiently and integrate the acquired financial institution while maintaining the stability of our existing business. In certain circumstances  ,   we may seek to acquire financial institutions that may be located outside of our  

41   

Table of Contents  

existing footprint. We also seek opportunities which will allow us to further diversify our noninterest income base, including adding to our wealth management platform  . 

We are subject to competition from other financial institutions  , non-financial companies   and   other competitors and   our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating exclusively or primarily in Colorado, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in Colorado, including the strength of the Colorado real estate market. In addition, the fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies of the federal government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows  .

Earnings Summary 

The following table   summarizes certain key financial results for the periods indicated:

Table of Contents  

Third quarter 2016 net income decreased $0.2 million to $5.8 million as compared to $6.0 million for the same quarter in 2015. The $0.2 million decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a $3.8 million increase in noninterest expense, impacted by $2.2 million in merger-related expenses. Excluding merger-related expense  ,   noninterest expense increased by an additional $1.6 million in the third quarter 2016, compared to the third quarter 2015. Offsetting the increased noninterest expense, net interest income increased by $3.3 million to $22.8 million compared to $19.4 million in the third quarter 2015. This increase in net interest income was comprised of a $4.5 million increase in interest income and a $1.1 million increase in interest expense in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter 2015. Additionally, noninterest income increased by $0.3 million, and income tax expense increased $0.1 million in the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter 2015. The $2.2 million in merger-related expenses were comprised of $1.4 million in salaries and employee benefit expense related to severance and retention payments and $0.8 million in other general and administrative expenses, primarily legal and conversion-related. Excluding the severance and retention expense included in salaries and employee benefits, this category of expense increased $1.1 million in the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter 2015, mostly due to the additional expense associated with an increased number of employees subsequent to the transaction with Home State. The $4.5 million increase in interest income was primarily the result of a $307.4 million, or 18.0% increase in average loan balances in the third quarter 2016 as compared to the same quarter in 2015, a $0.8 million interest income recovery on a nonaccrual loan received in the third quarter 2016 and $0.3 million related to accretion of the discount applied to loans acquired in the Home State transaction. The increase in interest expense was due to a $0.5 million increase in subordinated debt expense, a $0.3 million increase in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings expense and a $0.4 million increase in interest expense on deposits. The $0.3 million increase in noninterest income in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the third quarter 2015, was attributable to an increase in deposit service and other fees primarily generated by deposits acquired in the transaction with Home State.    

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $17.0 million as compared to $16.6 million for the same period in 2015. The $0.4 million increase in net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of a $5.4 million increase in net interest income, comprised of an $8.2 million increase   in interest income, partially offset by a $2.7 million increase in interest expense, mostly offset by a $4.5 million increase in noninterest expense and a $0.7 million increase in income tax expense. The year-to-date increase in interest income was driven by a $274.0 million, or 16.9%  ,   increase in average loans, as compared to the same period in 2015  , in addition to the $0.8 million interest income recovery and the $0.3 million in discount accretion described above  . The $2.7 million increase in interest expense during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was due to a $1.2 million increase in FHLB borrowing expense, a $1.0 million increase in interest expense on deposits, and a $0.6 million increase in interest expense on subordinated debt.   The $4.5 million increase in noninterest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily attributable to $3.2 million in merger-related expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2016. The   $3.2 million in merger-related expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2016 were comprised of $1.4 million in salaries and employee benefits related to severance and retention payments and $1.8 million in other general and administrative expenses. Excluding the merger-related expenses, noninterest expense increased $1.3 million for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, due to a $2.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by a $0.8 million decline in occupancy expense.   Income tax expense increased $0.7 million as a result of increased pretax income in addition to an increase in the effective tax rate from 33.3% to 34.7%, resulting from reduced tax exempt income as a percentage of total pretax income in addition to the impact of certain nondeductible merger expenses.  

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin 

Net interest income, which is our primary source of income, represents the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. The interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on our interest-bearing assets and liabilities. Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets  .

The   following table summarizes the Company s net interest income and related spread and margin for the quarter   ended   September   30, 2016   and the   prior four quarters: 

Table 2 

Net interest income increased $3.3 million in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the same quarter in 2015, due to a $4.5 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was the result of a $307.4 million, or 18.0%, increase in average loan balances in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the same quarter in 2015, a $0.8 million interest income recovery on a nonaccrual loan received in the third quarter 2016 and $0.3 million related to accretion of the discount applied to loans acquired in the Home State transaction. The increase in interest expense was due to a $0.5 million increase in subordinated debt expense, a $0.3 million increase in FHLB borrowings expense and a $0.4 million increase in interest expense on deposits. On July 18, 2016, we issued $40.0 million of unsecured fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, to raise the cash consideration paid to the shareholders of Home State in connection with the transaction. FHLB borrowing expense increased in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the same quarter in 2015, as a result of fixed-rate hedged borrowings, $25.0 million of which became effective in the third quarter 2015 and $25.0 million of which became effective in the first quarter 2016. Interest expense on deposits increased in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the third quarter 2015, due to higher average deposit balances, attributable to both organic growth and the Home State transaction.    

As compared to the second quarter 2016, net interest income increased by $2.9 million due to a $3.5 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income during the third quarter 2016, as compared to the second quarter 2016, was primarily due to a $165.3 million increase in average loan balances and a $37.7 million increase in average investment balances. The $0.6 million increase in interest expense in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the second quarter 2016, was mostly due to the newly issued $40.0 million   of unsecured fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, discussed above. 

During the third quarter 2016, net interest margin increased nine basis points to 3.66%, as compared to the second quarter 2016 and increased seven basis points as compared to the third quarter 2015. The increase in the net interest margin in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the second quarter 2016, was primarily the result of t  he   $0.8 million interest income recovery and $0.3 million in discount accretion on purchased loans, outlined above.

Table   3 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net interest income increased $5.4 million, as compared to the same period in 2015, due to an $8.2 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $2.7 million increase in interest expense. The year-to-date increase in interest income was driven by a $274.0 million, or 16.9%  ,   increase in average loans, as compared to the same period in 2015. The $2.7 million increase in interest expense during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was due to a $1.2 million increase in FHLB borrowing expense, a $1.0 million increase in interest expense on de  posits   and a $0.6 million increase in interest expense on subordinated debt. As outlined above, the increased cost of FHLB borrowings was the result of our hedged borrowings becoming fully effective, increased borrowing levels required to fund loan growth and an increase in short-term, variable rates resulting from the December 2015 federal funds interest rate increase. The increase in interest expense on deposits in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was the result of a five basis point increase in weighted average cost and a $185.1 million increase in average balances. The increase in interest expense on subordinated debt in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was mostly due to the newly issued $40.0 million of unsecured fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, discussed above.

The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Information is provided for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with respect to (i) changes attributable to volume (i.e., changes in average balances multiplied by the prior-period average rate) and (ii) changes attributable to rate (i.e., changes in average rate multiplied by prior-period average balances). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate  .

P  rovision for Loan Losses 

The provision for loan losses is a charge against earnings and represents management s estimate of the amount required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that, in our judgment, is adequate to absorb probable incurred loan losses in the loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses is based on our allowance methodology and reflects our judgments about the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In determining the amount of the provision, we consider certain quantitative and qualitative factors, including our historical loan loss experience, the volume and type of lending we conduct, the results of our credit review process, the amounts and severity of classified, criticized and nonperforming assets, regulatory policies, general economic conditions, underlying collateral values and other factors regarding collectability and impairment. The estimated amount of expected loss in our loan portfolio is influenced by the collateral value associated with our loans. Loans with greater collateral values, as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance, reduce our exposure to loan loss provision.  

In the   third     quarter 2016  , we recorded an immaterial provision for loan losses  ,   as compared to an immaterial provision for loan losses in the   second   quarter 2016 and a  n immaterial provision   for loan losses in the   third   quarter 2015.   Management considered several factors in its calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and resulting provision required to absorb the probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of   September   30, 2016. 

Net recoveries in the third quarter 2016 were $223,000, as compared to an immaterial level of net recoveries in the second quarter 2016 and   an immaterial level of net recoveries   in the   third   quarter 2015.

Noninterest Income 

The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the current quarter and prior four quarters: 

Table   6 

Third quarter 2016 noninterest income was $4.7 million, as compared to $4.1 million in the second quarter 2016 and $4.4 million in the third quarter 2015. The $0.6 million increase in noninterest income in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the second quarter 2016, was primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in deposit service and other fees, primarily generated by deposits acquired in the transaction with Home State as well as smaller increases in other categories. The $0.3 million increase in noninterest income in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the third quarter 2015, was attributable to an increase in deposit service and other fees primarily generated by deposits acquired in the transaction with Home State.    

The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the year-to-date periods presented  : 

Table   7 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income increased $0.1 million to $13.0 million as compared to $12.9 million for the same period in 2015.

Noninterest Expense 

The following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense for the current quarter and prior four quarters: 

Table   8 

Noninterest expense increased $3.8 million to $18.6 million in the third 2016, as compared to $14.9 million in the third quarter 2015 and i  ncreased   $3.5 million as compared to the second quarter 2016.    

Noninterest expense increased by $3.8 million in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the third quarter 2015, primarily due to $2.2 million in merger-related expenses inc  urred in the third quarter 2016,   consisting of $1.4 million in salaries and employee benefit expense related to severance and retention payments and $0.8 million in other general and administrative expenses. Excluding the   severance and retention expense   included in salaries and employee benefits, this category of expense increased $1.3 million, consisting of $0.8 million related to the   increased number of   employees   as a result of the transaction with   Home State and a $0.5 million increase in base salaries and employee benefit expense. 

Third quarter 2016 noninterest expense increased $3.5 million, as compared to the second quarter 2016, primarily as a result of a $1.9 million increase in merger-related expe  nses,   consisting of a $1.4 million increase in salaries and employee benefit expense related to severance and retention payments and a $0.5 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. Excluding   the severance and retention expense   included in salaries and employee benefits, this category of expense increased $1.1 million, mostly due to expenses related to the   increase in   employees   subsequent to the transaction with Home State  .   

The following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense for the   year-to-date periods presented  :

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense was $49.6 million, as compared to $45.1 million for the same period in 2015. The $4.5 million increase in noninterest expense during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to $3.2 million in merger-related expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2016; consisting of $1.4 million in salaries and employee benefits related to severance and retention payments and $1.8 million in other general and administrative expenses. Excluding the merger-related expenses, noninterest expense increased $1.3 million for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, due to a $2.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by a $0.8 million decline in occupancy expense. The $2.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits was due to $0.8 million related to   the increased number of employees subsequent to the transaction with   Home State, a $0.8 million increase in base salaries and a $0.4 million increase in the Company s self-funded medical plan.   T  he increase   in salaries exclusive of the increase related to former Home State employees was mostly the result of new positions within our credit, wealth management and commercial lending departments. Although we added new positions within these groups, we maintained a stable level of average FTE employees during each period. The   $0.8 million decrease in occupancy expense was related to a reduction in rent and depreciation expense related to the restructure of the lease for the Company s corporate office.   

Income Taxes  

Income tax expense was $3.0 million for the third quarter 2016 as compared to $2.9 million for the third quarter 2015. The increase in taxes for the third quarter 2016 was primarily a result of the impact of certain non  -  deductible merger-related expenses.     During the   third   quarter 2016, our effective tax rate   increased to 34.6% from approximately 32.8% for the same period in 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate was mostly due to a decrease in tax-exempt income as a percentage of total taxable and tax-exempt income as well as the non-deductible nature of certain merger-related expenses. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

The following sets forth certain key consolidated balance sheet data: 

Table   10 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had total assets of $3.3 billion, reflecting an increase of $977.7 million as compared to December 31, 2015, and an increase of $1.1 billion as compared to September 30, 2015. The increase in total assets during the first nine months of 2016 was comprised of a $598.5 million increase in loans, a $137.4 million increase in investments, a $137.2 million increase in cash and a $67.0 million increase in intangible assets related to the transaction with Home State. In addition, there were $37.6 million of combined increases in several other categories of nonearning assets. Loans acquired in the transaction with Home State during the third quarter 2016 were $445.5 million. Excluding the loans acquired from Home State, loans grew $68.9 million, or 14.4% annualized during the third quarter 2016.    

As compared to   September   30, 2015, the increase in total assets of $1.1 billion was primarily due to a $686.8 million increase in loans, a $128.8 million increase in investments, a $140.2 million increase in cash   and   a $66.5 million   increase in intangible assets related to the transaction with Home State. In addition, there were $38.3 million of combined increases in several other categories of nonearning assets.

The following table presents the changes in our loan balances (including loans held for sale) at the dates indicated: 

Table 12 

During the third quarter 2016, loans net of deferred costs and fees increased $514.5 million. Loans acquired in the transaction with Home State during the third quarter 2016 were $445.5 million. Excluding the loans acquired from Home State, loans grew $68.9 million during the third quarter 2016 despite $214.1 million in net pay-downs and maturities during the quarter. In addition to contractual loan principal payments and maturities, the third quarter 2016 included $37.7 million in early payoffs related to our borrowers selling their assets, $24.3 million in payoffs due to our strategic decision to not match certain financing terms offered by competitors and $27.8 million in loan pay-downs related to fluctuations in loan balances to existing customers.    

As compared to   September   30, 2015, loans net of unearned fees increased by $686.8 million, or 39  .8  %. Excluding the loans acquired from Home State, loans grew $241.3 million  ,   or 14.0%  ,   during the preceding 12 months.   At   September   30  , 2016, our commercial and residential real estate portfolio   included   $482.8 million   of 1-4 family residential loans. The utilization rate on commercial lines of   credit   was   50  .3%   at     September   30  , 2016  ,   as compared to 41.2% at December 31, 2015 and   39.7  % as of   September   30  , 2015  . 

Under joint   guidance from the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and the   Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the    OCC   )   on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending, a financial institution may have elevated concentration risk if it has, among other factors, (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100% or more of capital (CRE 1), or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties, loans for construction, land development and other land and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, representing 300% or more of total capital (CRE 2) and an increase   in its commercial real estate loan portfolio of 50% or more during the preceding 36 months  . For the Bank, total loans for construction, land development and land   represented 39% of capital   at   September   30, 2016,   as compared to  

53   

Table of Contents  

47% at December 31, 2015   and 53% at     September   30, 2015. For the Bank, total commercial real estate loans   represented 314% of capital at     September   3  0  , 2016  , as compared to 356%   at December 31, 2015   and 351%   at   September     30,     2015.   Including $445.5 million in loans acquired in the Home State transaction, the Bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by 74.3% during the preceding 36 months. Excluding loans acquired in the transaction with Home State, the balance of commercial real estate loans increased by 48.1% during the preceding 36 months.   Management employs heightened risk management practices with respect to commercial   real estate lending, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. Loans   secured by commercial real estate are recorded on the balance sheet as either a commercial real estate loan or commercial loan depending   on the purpose of the loan, regardless of the underlying   collateral.    

With   respect to concentrations, most of our business activity is with customers in the state of Colorado. At   September   30  , 2016, we did not have   any significant concentrations in any particular industry. 

Nonperforming Assets and Other Impaired Loans 

Credit risk related to nonperforming assets is inherent in lending activities. To manage this risk, we utilize routine monitoring procedures and take prompt corrective action when necessary. We employ a risk rating system that identifies the potential risk associated with loans in our loan portfolio. This monitoring and rating system is designed to help management identify current and potential problems so that corrective actions can be taken promptly. 

L  oans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off prior to the date on which they would otherwise enter past due status if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. The interest on a nonaccrual loan is accounted for using the   cost recovery or   cash-basis method until the loan qualifies for a return to the accrual basis method  . Generally  , payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied first to the principal balance of the loan  , and then to interest, and only to the extent that the remaining recorded investment in the loan is determined to be fully collectible  . A loan is returned to accrual status after the delinquent borrower s financial condition has improved, when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and when the likelihood of the borrower making future timely payments   is   reasonably assured. 

A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments when due according to the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreement. Impaired loans consist of our nonaccrual loans, loans th  at are 90 days or more past due   and other loans for which we determine that noncompliance with contractual terms of the loan agreement is probable. Losses   on     individually identified   impaired loans that are not collateral dependent are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate of each loan. For loans that are collateral dependent, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs.

Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued, loans with payments more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest and OREO. For reporting purposes, OREO consists of all real estate, other than bank premises, actually owned or controlled by us, including real estate acquired through foreclosure.

As of September 30,   2016, nonperforming loans decreased by $8.6 million, as compared to December 31, 2015 and decreased by $8.7 million as compared to   September   30, 2015.     The decrease in nonperforming loans at   September   30, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of the transfer of a $9.  4 million out-of-state syndicated loan   to performing status  , partially offset by   $2.1 million of nonperforming loans and $0.1 million of other real estate owned acquired   in the Home State transaction  . As of   September   30, 2016, no additional funds were committed to be advanced in connection with non-performing loans.    

Net recoveries of $0.2 million were recognized during the third quarter 2016 compared to immaterial net recoveries in the   second quarter   2016 and third quarter 2015.  

We categorize loans into risk categories of  pass ,  pass-watch ,  special mention ,  substandard ,  doubtful  and  loss . These internal categories are based on the definitions in the Uniform Agreement on the Classification of Assets and Appraisal of Securities Held by Banks and Thrifts issued by the OCC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In particular, we consider loans that we have internally rated as substandard, doubtful or loss as adversely classified loans. The amount of accruing loans that we have internally considered to be adversely classified   was $  28.5   million at   September   30  , 2016, as compared to $11.3 million at December 31, 2015 and $  15.3   million at   September   30  , 2015.   The increase in accruing loans adversely classified as of September 30, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, was primarily a result of the third quarter 2016 transfer of a $9.4 million nonaccrual loan to accruing status in addition to the acquisition of classified loans in the transaction with Home State.  

At   September   30, 2016, classified assets represented 10.7% of bank level capital and allowance for loan losses, as compared to 11.7% as of December 31, 2015 and 13.5% as of   September   30, 2015.    

In addition to adversely classified loans, we have loans that are considered to be  special mention  and  pass-watch  loans. Each internal risk rating is ultimately subjective, but is based on both objective and subjective factors and criteria. The internal risk ratings focus on an evaluation of the borrowers  ability to meet future debt service and performance to plan and consider  s   potential adverse market or economic conditions. As described below under  Allowance for Loan Losses , we adjust the general component of our allowance for loan losses for trends in the volume and severity of adversely classified and  pass-watch  list loans, which encompasses any loan with a classification of  pass-watch  or worse.  

Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) was $0.6 million at   September   30, 2016, $0.7 million at December 31, 2015 and $1.4 million at   September   30, 2015.   The balance of OREO at   September   30, 2016   and September 30, 2015   was comprised of three separate properties, each of which   was   land.  

As of   September   30, 2016, we had $24.4 million of loans with terms that were modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) with a total allocated allowance for loan loss of $0.3 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had $22.4 million of loans with terms that were modified in TDRs with a total allocated allowance for loan loss of $0.3 million. At   September   30, 2016, we had $1.9 million   of unfunded commitments to borrowers whose loans were classified as TDRs  . 

All acquired loans are initially recorded at their estimated fair value which encompasses an estimate of credit losses. The table below presents two alternative views of credit risk coverage ratios for loans, reflecting adjustments for acquired loans and the associated purchase accounting discount: 

Table   1  4    

1   Unaccreted net discount relates to $445.5 million of acquired loans and is assigned specifically to those loans only.  The discount represents the remaining acquisition date fair value adjustment based on market, liquidity, interest rate risk and credit risk and is being accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the respective loans.   Credit deterioration on acquired loans subsequent to purchase will result in recognition of additional allowance for loan losses to the extent recorded investment exceeds net realizable value.

The   following provides a rollforward of   TDRs for the nine   month periods ended   September   30, 2016   and   September   3  0  , 2015  :   

Table   16 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that, in our judgment, is adequate to absorb probable incurred loan losses in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfo  lio, historical loss experience   and other significant factors affecting loan portfolio collectability, including   credit quality, loan class concentration levels, economic conditions, loan growth dynamics and organizational conditions  .   Purchased loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition, which includes an adjustment related to expected credit losses; as a result no allowance is recorded on these loans upon acquisition.  Subsequent deterioration in the credit of purchased loans will result in the recognition of an allowance on these loans beyond the discount created upon acquisition.  

The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.97% at   September   30, 2016,   as compared to 1.27  % at December   31, 2015 a  nd 1.33% at   September   30, 2015. The ratio of allowance for loan losses plus unaccreted discount to total loans was 1.61% at   September   30, 2016  . 

Our methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses has two basic elements: first, the specific identification of impaired   loans and the measurement of an estimated loss for each individual loan identified; and second, estimating a nonspecific allowance for probable losses   incurred   on all other loans. 

The specific allowance for impaired loans and the allowance calculated for probable incurred losses on other loans are combined to determine the required allowance for loan losses. The amount calculated is compared to the    

57   

Table of Contents  

r  ecorded allowance balance at each quarter end and any shortfall is charged against income as an additi  onal provision for loan losses. However, if the recorded allowance exceeds the amount calculated, then the difference would be credited to income as a credit provision for loan losses.   For further discussion of the provision for loan losses, see  Provision for Loan Losses  above. 

In estimating the allowance for probable incurred losses on other loans, we group the balance of the loan portfolio into portfolio segments that have common characteristics, such as loan type or risk rating. For each nonspecific allowance portfolio segment, we apply loss factors to calculate the required allowance based upon actual historical loss rates over a time period that we have determined represents the current credit cycle, adjusted for qualitative factors affecting loan portfolio collectability  ,   as described above. We also look at risk ratings of loans and compute a qualitative adjustment   based on our   credit quality   in consideration of credit quality d  uring the historical loss period. We also consider other qualitative factors that may warrant adjustment of the computed historical loss rate,   including loan growth, loan concentrations, economic considerations and organizational factors. 

During the   third   quarter 2016,   we   recorded   a $27,000   provision for   loan losses  , as   compared   to    a  n immaterial   provision for loan losses in the   second   quarter 201  6   and   an immaterial provision for loan losses     in the third quarter 2015. Management considered net recoveries, t  he level of nonperforming loans, loan portfolio composition and loan growth in its calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and resulting provision required to absorb the probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of   September   30, 2016  .    For further discussion of the provision for loan losses, see  Provision for Loan   Losses  above. 

Approximately $0.6 million, or 2.5%, of the $23.3 million allowance   for loan losses at   September   30  , 2016 relates to specific reserve allocations. This compares to a specific reserve of $0.3 million, or 1.3%, of the total allowance for loan losses at December 31  , 201  5  .   

The general component of the allowance as a percentage of overall loans, net of unearned loan fees, was 0.94% at   September   30, 2016,   as compared to 1.25% at December 31, 2015 and 1.31% at   September   30, 2015  . The decrease in the general reserve as a percentage of loans between   September   30, 2015 and   September   30, 2016 was primarily   due   to the impact of loans acquired in the Home State   transaction, which pursuant to generally accepted a  ccounting   p  rinciples  ,   are recorded net of a fair value purchase discount     upon acquisition and withou  t an allowance for loan l  osses.    

We monitor the allowance for loan losses closely and adjust the allowance when necessary, based on our analysis, which includes an ongoing evaluation of substandard loans and their collateral positions. 

The following table provides a summary of the activity within the allowance for loan losses account for the periods presented:

Securities 

We manage our investment portfolio principally to provide liquidity, balance our overall interest rate risk and to provide collateral for public deposits and customer repurchase agreements.  

The carrying value of our portfolio of investment securities at the dates indicated were as follows:    

Table 1  8 

The carrying value of our available for sale investment securities at   September   30  , 2016   was $364.3   million   as compared to the December 31, 2015 carrying value of $255.4 million.   The $  108.9   million   increase   in available for sale securities from December 31, 2015 was primarily a result of the   acquisition   of approximately $  396.5   million   in securities in the transaction with Home State and the subsequent sale of the majority of these securities prior to   September 30, 2016. The Company sold   the majority of Home State s investment portfolio   prior to September     30,     2016   in order to fund anticipated growth in earning assets, reduce borrowing levels and mitigate interest rate risk.  

The carrying value of our held to maturity securities at   September   30  , 2016   was $183.2 million   as compared to $148.8 million at December 31, 2015.  

At   September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our investment securities portfolio had an average effective duration of   approximately 4.  7   years and   5.1 years, respectively. 

The   fair values of our securities are determined through the utilization of evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available market information. The evaluated pricing models apply available information as applicable through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of li  ke securities, sector groupings   and matrix pricing. These models assess interest rate impact, develop prepayment scenarios and take into account market conventions. Standard inputs into these models include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications.    

Six municipal bond   issuances were priced using significant unobservable inputs as of   September   30  , 2016, the largest of which is a revenue bond issued by the   Colorado Health Facilities Authority   with a par value of $24.1 million and repayment supported by cash flows from a local hospital. We reviewed the financials of the hospital, had discussions with hospital management and reviewed the underlying collateral of the municipal bond to determine an appropriate benchmark risk-adjusted interest rate based on bonds with similar risks.   Utilizing the discounted cash flow method and an   estimate of current market rates for similar bonds, management determined that the estimated fair value of this bond as of   September   30,   2016 was equal to its par   value.

Table of Contents  

At   September   30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015,   we held $14.6 million   and $20.5 million, respectively, of other equity securities consisting primarily of bank stocks with no maturity date, which are not   reflected   in Table 1  8     above. Bank stocks are comprised of stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the F  ederal Home Loan Bank of Topeka,   Bankers  Bank of the West   and Pacific Coast Bankers  Bank  . These stocks have restrictions placed on their transferability as only members of the entities can own the stock. We   review the equity securities quarterly for potential impairment. No impairment has been recognized on these equity securities  . 

Deposits 

The following table sets forth the amounts of our deposits outstanding at the dates indicated: 

Table 1  9 

Total deposits increased $  950.3   million at   September   30, 2016  ,   as compared to December 31, 2015  , including $769.7 million in deposits acquired in the Home State transaction  .   Excluding deposits acquired in the Home State transaction, deposits increased by $180.6 million  ,   or 13.4%  ,   in the first   nine months of 2016.   Excluding the deposits acquired in the Home State transaction, non-maturing deposits increased $145.9 million   during   the   first nine   months   of 2016   as a result of   seasonal cash fluctuations of various commercial customers in addition to new customer relationships.   Excluding time deposits acquired in the Home State   transaction,   time deposits   increased $34.6 million in the first nine months of 2016   due in part to a $  22.4   million increase in our brokered CDs and a successful in-market retail time deposit campaign. Because of the current low interest-rate environment, and because of the span of time since the last period of increasing interest rates, we are uncertain what impact, if any, rising interest rates would have on our deposit base.    

Noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total   deposits   were   approximately 31.1%   at   September   30, 2016, as compared to 34.0% at December 31, 2015. Noninterest-bearing deposits help   reduce overall funding costs; however, due to the extremely low rate environment, the impact of noninterest-bearing deposits on the overall cost of funds is currently less significant than in a higher   rate environment. 

Time deposit balances   comprised 13.7%   of   total deposits at   September   30  , 2016. The majority of the time deposit balance represented deposits of local customers,   with $100.8 million   representing brokered   deposits, as compared to $78.4 million at December 31, 2015. We monitor time deposit maturities and renewals on a daily basis and will raise rates on local time deposits if necessary to   grow such deposits. 

Securities Sold under Agreement to Repurchase 

At   September   30  , 2016, securities sold under agreements to repurchase   were $35.9 million, an increase of $9.  5   million as compared to December 31, 2015, and an increase of $5.  8   million as compared   to   September     30,     2015  .   Securities sold under agreements to repurchase acquired in the transaction with Home State were $20.0 million as of September 8, 2016.  

Borrowings   and Subordinated Debentures 

At   September   30  , 2016  , our FHLB borrowings   were $122.5 million as compared to $280.8 million at December 31, 2015 and $151.3 million at   September   30, 2015. At   September   30, 2016,   borrowings consisted of $122.5 million in term notes. At December 31, 2015, our   FHLB borrowings consisted of $95.0 million in term notes and $185.8 million in line of credit advances. The total FHLB commitment, including balances outstanding, at   September   30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015   was $  831.6   million   and $454.7 million, respectively.

Table of Contents  

Under an   advance, pledge and security agreement with the FHLB, the Bank had additional borrowing capacity of   approximately $  709.2   million at     September   30  , 2016  , which can be utilized for term and  /  or line of credit advances. 

The FHLB term borrowings at   September   30  , 2016   consisted of   four   fixed-rate term notes and two variable-rate term notes. A $20.0 million, fixed-rate term advance matures on January 23, 2018 with an interest rate of 2.52% and is   convertible on a quarterly basis by the FHLB to a variable rate borrowing. If the note is converted by the FHLB, we have the   option to prepay the advance without penalty. A $50.0 million, fixed-rate term advance with an interest rate   of 0.63% matured on October 24, 2016  .     The remaining   two fixed rate term notes of   $695,000   and   $1,740,000   have maturity dates of   April 10, 2017   and   August 30, 2017  , respectively. The notes were acquired   in the transaction   with Home State and have an unamortized fair value premium of approximately   $86,000   as of   September 30, 2016  .     A $25.0 million, variable-rate term advance with a current   interest rate of 0.87% matures on August 4, 2017  . A $25.0 million, variable-rate term advance with a current interest rate of   1.03  % matures on March 7, 2017. We expect that both $25.0 million, variable-rate term advances will be renewed annually for the next four years given their direct relationship to our five year forward starting balance sheet swaps initiated in June 201  3   and February 2014. The rates on the variable-rate term notes reset quarterly.   The interest rate on our FHLB line of credit borrowing is variable and   was 0.53%   at   September   3  0  , 2016  , however no balance was outstanding our line of credit as of September 30, 2016.  

At   September   30, 2016 the balance of the Company s outstanding subordinated debentures (the  Debentures ) was   $65.0 million  , comprised of   $65  .8 million in   in debt, partially offset by   $  0.8 million   in debt issuance costs. At December 31, 2015 the balance of the Company s Debentures was $  25  .8 million.   As of   September   30, 2016, the Company's Debentures bore a weighted average cost of funds of   4.87%  .   

The Company s Debentures were issued in   three   separate series. The first two issuances have maturities of   30   years from the date of issuance. These two issuances of Debentures were issued to trusts established by the Company, which in turn issued $  25.0 million   of trust preferred securities ( TruPS ). Generally, and with certain limitations, the Company is permitted to call the Debentures subsequent to the first   five   or   ten   years, as applicable, after issuance, if certain conditions are met, or at any time upon the occurrence and continuation of certain changes in either the tax treatment or the capital treatment of the trusts, the Debentures or the preferred securities. The Guaranty Capital Trust III TruPS became callable at each quarterly interest payment date starting on July 7, 2008. The CenBank Trust III TruPS became callable at each quarterly interest payment date starting on April 15, 2009. 

The third issuance was executed on July 18, 2016 in anticipation of the   transaction   with Home State, in order to fund the cash consideration to be paid to Home State shareholders in conjunction with the   transaction  . The issuance was comprised of   $  40.0 million   of   5.75%   Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (the  Notes ) due July 20, 2026.   The Notes will initially bear a fixed interest rate of 5.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. On July 20, 2021, and, thereafter, the interest on the Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears, at an annual floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR as determined by the applicable quarterly period, plus   4.73%  . 

In April 2016,   we   entered into a   c  redit   a  greement   for a $10.0 million holding company line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association  .    This line of credit is secured with the holding company s stock in   the Bank.     The line of credit matures on March 17, 2017. Under the   credit agreement  ,    we can elect a   fixed or floating interest rate on each advance. As of   September   30, 2016 no amounts had been borrowed on this line of credit  . 

Capital Resources 

Current risk-based regulatory capital standards generally require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.50%, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.00%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets (leverage ratio) of at least 4.00% and a ratio of total capital (which includes Tier 1 capital plus certain forms of subordinated debt, a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses and preferred stock) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.00%. However, u  nder the final rule on Enhanced Regulatory Capital Standards, commonly referred to as Basel III, which became effective in the first quarter 2015,   a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, comprised of Common Equity Tier 1, is established above the regulatory minimum capital requirement. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in between January 1, 2016 and year end 2018  ,   becoming ful  ly effective on January 1, 2019, however the full  y phased-  in capital conservation buffer is included in the table below.  

The Bank made the one-time AOCI opt-out election on   its March 31, 2015 Call Report, which allowed   community banks under $250 billion  ,     who made the   one-time opt-out election  ,   to remove the impact of certain

unrealized gains and losses from the calculation of   regulatory   capital. There is no opportunity to change methodology in future periods. 

Risk-weighted assets are calculated by multiplying the balance in each category of assets by a risk factor, which ranges from zero for cash assets and certain government obligations to 150% for some loans, and adding the products together. 

For regulatory purposes, we maintain capital above the minimum core standards. We   actively monitor our regulatory capital ratios to ensure that the Company and the Bank are more than  well capitalized  under the applicable regulatory framework.   Under these regulations, a bank is considered  well capitalized  if the institution has a Common   Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for   any capital measure. The Bank is required to maintain similar capital levels under capital adequacy guidelines. At   September   30, 2016  ,   each of the Bank s   capital ratios   was   above the regulatory capital thr  eshold of  well   capitalized . 

The following table provides the capital ratios of the Company and   the   Bank as of the dates presented, along with the applicable regulatory capital requirements  .   

Table   20 

At   September   30  ,    2016, all   of our regulatory capital ratios remain well above minimum requirements for a  well-capitalized  institution.   The Company s consolidated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio decreased relative to December 31, 2015 whereas the Company s total risk-based capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2015. The transaction with Home State was financed through the issuance of $40.0 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, which qualified for treatment as Tier 2 capital and by the issuance of common stock valued at $117.5 million, which qualified as Common Equity Tier 1 capital.

Dividends  

Holders of voting common stock are entitled to dividends out of funds legally available for such dividends, when, and if, declared by the Board of Directors. Beginning in May 2013, we paid cash dividends of two and one-half cents per share to stockholders on a quarterly basis through November 2013. Beginning in February 2014, we increased the cash dividend to five cents per share on a quarterly basis through November 2014. Beginning in February 2015, we increased the cash dividend to ten cents per share on a quarterly basis through November 2015.     In February 2016, we increased the quarterly cash dividend     to 11   and one half cents per share. 

Our ability to pay   dividends is subject to the restrictions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Because we are a bank holding company with no significant assets other than our bank subsidiary, we currently depend upon dividends from our bank subsidiary for the majority of our revenues.   Various banking laws applicable to the Bank limit the payment of dividends, management fees and other distributions by the Bank to the holding company, and may therefore limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Under these laws, the Bank is currently required to request permission from   the Federal Reserve prior to payment of a dividend to the holding company.  

Under the terms of each of our two outstanding trust preferred financings, including our related subordinated debentures, which occurred on June 30, 2003 and April 8, 2004, respectively, we cannot declare or pay any dividends or distributions (other than stock dividends) on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of our capital stock if (i) an event of default under any of the subordinated debenture agreements has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) we defer payment of interest on the TruPS for a period of up to 60 consecutive months. At   September   30  , 2016  , there was no event of default under the subordinated debenture agreements and interest payments on our two   trust preferred financings were current. 

Any   future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including general business conditions, our financial results, our future business prospects, capital requirements, contractual, legal, and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by the Bank to the holding company, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant  . 

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet   Arrangements  

The Bank is a party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk entered into in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of the Bank s customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.  

Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments as   we do   for on-balance sheet instruments  .    

At the dates indicated, the following commitments were outstanding: 

Table   2  1 

Liquidity 

The Bank relies   up  on deposits as its principa  l source of funds and therefore   must be in a position to service depositors  needs as they arise. Fluctuations in the account balances of a few large depositors may cause temporary    

63   

Table of Contents  

increases and d  ecreases in liquidity from time to   time. We deal with such fluctuations by using other sources of liquidity, as discussed below. 

The Bank s   initial sources of liquidity are its liquid assets. At   September   30  , 2016  , the   Company had   $163.9   million   of cash and cash equivalents. Further, the Bank   had $  6.1   million   in excess pledging related to customer accounts that required collateral   and $  165.0   million   of unencumbered securities that were available for pledging to our FHLB line   at   September   30, 2016  .   

When the level of our   liquid assets does not meet our liquidity needs, other available sources of liquid assets, including the purchase of federal funds, sales of loans, including jumbo mortgage loans, brokered and internet certificates of deposit, one-way purchases of certificates of deposit through the Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Service, discount window borrowings from the Federal Reserve and our lines of credit with the FHLB and other correspondent banks  ,   are employed to meet current and presently anticipated funding needs. At   September   3  0  , 2016, the Bank had   approximately $709.2 million of availability on its FHLB line, $50.8   million   of availability on its secured and unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent   banks and $3.6 million   of availability with the Federal Reserve   discount   window. 

At   September   30  , 2016, the Bank   had $115.8 million of brokered deposits, of which $15.0 million were money markets  , $6.5 million will mature in the fourth quarter 2016, $13.3 million will mature in the second quarter 2017, $15.8 million will mature in the third quarter 2017, $5.0 million will mature in the fourth quarter 2017, $42.1 million will mature during 2018 and $18.1 million will mature during 2019 and 2020. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank maintained $78.4 million in brokered deposits  . We continue to evaluate new brokered deposits as a source of low-cost, longer-term funding. 

The   holding company relies primarily on cash flow from the Bank as its source of liquidity. The holding company requires liquidity for the payment of interest on the subordinated debentures, for operating expenses, principally salaries and benefits, for repurchases of our common stock, and, if declared by our Board of Directors, for the payment of dividends to our stockholders. The Bank pays a management fee for its share of expenses paid by the holding company as well as for services provided by the holding company. As discussed in the  Capital Resources  section above, various banking laws applicable to the Bank limit the payment of dividends by the Bank to the holding company and may therefore limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Under these laws, the Bank is currently required to request permission from the Federal Reserve prior to payment of a dividend to the Company. Under the terms of our TruPS financings, we may defer payment of interest on the subordinated debentures and related TruPS for a period of up to 60 consecutive months as long as we are in compliance with all covenants of the agreement  .   

As of   September   30  ,    2016, the holding company had   approximately $11.5 million of cash   on hand, which we expect will be sufficient to fund holding company operations and projected quarterly external stockholder dividends at the current rate through the remainder of 2016. In April 2016, the holding company entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo   Bank, National Association   for a $10.0 million secured   line of credit. The line of credit is secured with the holding company s stock in   the Bank  . At   September   30  , 2016, there were no funds drawn on the line   of credit.  

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  discusses the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates on an ongoing basis its estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from the recorded estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of critical accounting policies and estimates are listed in the "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of the Company s Annual Report   on   Form 10-K for the     f  iscal year ended December 31, 201  5  .    There have been no changes during 201  6   to the critical accounting policies listed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 201  5  .

ITEM     3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  , investing   and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure. We have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. We manage our interest rate sensitivity by matching the repricing opportunities on our earning assets to those on our funding liabilities. In order to manage the repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities, we use various strategies designed to ensure that our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited in accordance with our guidelines of acceptable levels of risk-taking. Balance sheet hedging strategies, including monitoring the terms and pricing of loans and deposits and managing the deployment of our securities, are used to reduce mismatches in interest rate repricing between our portfolio of assets and their funding sources. 

Net Interest Income Modeling 

Our Asset Liability Management Committee, or ALCO, oversees our exposure to and mitigation of interest rate risk and, along with our Board of Directors, reviews our exposure to interest rate risk at least quarterly. The committee is composed of members of our senior management. The ALCO monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact on the net portfolio value and net interest income from potential changes in interest rates, and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure. The ALCO manages our balance sheet in part to minimize the potential impact   of changes in interest rates   on net portfolio value and net interest income. 

Interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to evaluate fluctuations in net portfolio value and net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates. If potential changes to net portfolio value and net interest income from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within the limits approved by the Board of Directors, the Board may direct management to adjust the Bank s mix of assets and liabilities to bring interest rate risk within these limits. 

We monitor and evaluate our interest rate risk position on at least a quarterly basis using net interest income simulation analysis under 100, 200 and 300 basis point change scenarios (see below). Each of these analyses measures different interest rate risk factors inherent in the financial statements.  

Our primary interest rate risk measurement tool  ,   the  Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis , measures interest rate risk and the effect of hypothetical interest rate changes on net interest income. This analysis incorporates all of our assets and liabilities together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through these simulations, we estimate the impact on net interest income of an immediate change in market rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points upward or downward, over a one year period. Assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, our outlook and repricing strategies. Asset prepayments and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds and other market changes. Since the results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by the assumptions on which the simulations rely, we also evaluate the sensitivity of simulation results to changes in underlying assumptions.

The following table shows the projected net interest income increase or decrease over the   12   months     following   September   30, 2016 and   September   30,   2015  : 

Table 22 

Overall, we believe our balance sheet is   mildly   asset   sensitive; i.e. that a change in interest rates would have a greater impact on our assets than on our liabilities. At   September   30  , 2016, we are positioned to have a short-term favorable impact to net interest income in the event of an immediate 300, 200 or 100 basis point increase in market interest rates. Our asset sensitivity is mostly due to the amount of variable rate loans on the books and is partially mitigated by interest rate floors, or minimum rates: as rates rise, the loan rate may continue to be at the minimum rate. We also anticipate that deposit rates, other than time deposit rates, would increase immediately in a rising rate environment, but at a reduced magnitude. Additionally, the interest rates paid on our FHLB line of credit advances would increase immediately as well.   The primary reason that the benefit to net interest income is reduced between the 200 and 300 basis point increase in market interest rates is because we assume that our $20 million FHLB convertible term advance would be called by the FHLB in the event that market interest rates increased by 300 basis points.   In addition to performing net interest income modeling, we also monitor the impact an instantaneous change in interest rates would have on our economic value of equity. We anticipate a reduction in the economic value of equity in a rising rate environment as the reduction in the value of our fixed rate earning assets would outweigh the corresponding increase in value of our low cost deposits. As of   September   30  , 2016, our asset sensitivity had   increased   relative to     September   30  , 2015, primarily   as a result of the recent   transaction with   Home State.     

We estimate that our net interest income would decline in a 100 or 200 basis point falling rate environment. This is consistent with our belief that our balance sheet is asset sensitive. At   September   30  , 2016, it is not possible for the majority of our deposit rates to fall 100 to 300 basis points since most deposit rates were already below 100 basis points. At   September   30  , 2016, the loss of gross interest income in a falling interest rate environment is expected to exceed the corresponding reduction in interest expense in a falling rate environment. We believe that this scenario is unlikely. The target federal funds rate is currently set by the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board at a rate of between 25 and 50 basis points and the prime rate has historically been set at a rate of 300 basis points over the target federal funds rate. Our interest rate risk modeling assumes that the prime rate would continue to be set at a rate of 300 basis points over the target federal funds rate; therefore, a 200 basis point decline in overall rates would only result in a 25 to 50 basis point decline in both target federal funds rate and the prime rate. Further, other rates that are currently below 1% or 2% (e.g. short-term U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR) are modeled to not fall below 0% with an overall 100 or 200 basis point decrease in rates. Many of our variable rate loans are set to an index tied to the prime rate, the target federal funds rate or LIBOR, therefore, a further decrease in rates would likely not have a substantial impact on loan yields  .

ITEM 4.      Controls and Procedures  

The Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended [the  Exchange Act ] ) as of   September   3  0  , 2016  . Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at   September   30  , 2016  .   

The Company s disclosure controls and procedures were designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  .   

There have   been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act  )   during the fiscal quarter ended   September   30  , 2016   that have   materially affected, or   are   reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1.      Legal Proceedings 

The Company and th  e Bank are defendants, from time-  to  -  time, in legal actions at various points of the legal process arising from transactions conducted in the ordinary course of business. Management be  lieves that, after consultation   with legal counsel  ,   it is not probable that the outcome of current legal actions will result in a liability that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income or cash flows. In the event that such a legal action results in an unfavorable outcome, the resulting liability could have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income or cash flows.
