Note 1 -  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follows.

BUSINESS

Tech Central, Inc. ("TCI") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on April 30, 2014.

TCI was formed as a Media Company engaging in  online video and photography content development and distribution; and website and mobile app technology integration design and development.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. They do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the period presented have been included in the interim period. The operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future period.

These unaudited condensed financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained in the Company's S-1 Registration Statement filed on July 8, 2016.

ESTIMATES

The preparation of the financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company maintains a cash balance in a non-interest-bearing account that currently does not exceed federally insured limits. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

The Company values its investment in property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to five years. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had accumulated depreciation of $4,718 at December 31, 2015 the company had accumulated depreciation of $1,286.

7 

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 

Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount. We recognize revenue from sales or services rendered when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Receivables past due for more than 120 days are considered delinquent. Management determines uncollectible accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer's financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received. There were past due invoices in the amount of $25,000 as of September 30, 2016 that were subsequently paid in November  2016.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We have adopted Accounting Standards Codification regarding Disclosure About Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these items. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, nor do we utilize derivative instruments in the management of foreign exchange, commodity price or interest rate market risks.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification regarding Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are provided for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards when realization is more likely than not.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, "Revenue Recognition" ("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.

NET INCOME PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK

The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 105, "Earnings per Share" which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

The Company has no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued and outstanding during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.   

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives at each balance sheet date. The Company records an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.

8 

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718 "Stock Compensation", which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to an Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the estimated fair values. For non-employee stock-based compensation, we have adopted ASC Topic 505 "Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees", which requires stock-based compensation related to non-employees to be accounted for based on the fair value of the related stock or options or the fair value of the services on the grant date, whichever is more readily determinable in accordance with ASC Topic 718.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As of September 30, 2016 the Company does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

Note 2 - Uncertainty, Going Concern

The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs to allow it to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had retained earnings of   $31,577.   The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. The Company is contemplating conducting an offering of its debt or equity securities to obtain additional operating capital. The Company is dependent upon its ability, and will continue to attempt, to secure equity and/or debt financing. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

Note 3- Assets

The company purchased film equipment at the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 totaling a net balance of $18,166 and $21,598  respectively.

Note 4- Commitments and Contingencies

The Company entered into an employment agreement with its President to pay employee a base salary of $2,000 per month, plus applicable bonuses as are awarded by the Board of Directors from time to time based on performance, which may either be paid in stock or cash at the discretion of the Board. The Company and employee agreed that should the Company elect to cease payments of stated salary to employee for any reason, the salary would not accrue at the time of cessation unless the Company approves the accrual of salary or approves the salary being reinstated. At the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company has not paid salary nor has the Company accrued salary or agreed to accrue salary in the future.

Note 7   Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statement or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Under FASB ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.

As such we had taxes payable of $5,775 at the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Note 8   Subsequent Events

Management has reviewed events between September 30, 2016 to the date that the financials were issued, and there were no significant events identified for disclosure.

This "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (MD A) is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations. The following MD A discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's plans, estimates and beliefs. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed or referred to in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption "Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results" and under Part I, Item 1A, of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors."

Overview

We were incorporated in Wyoming on April 28, 2014 and we have elected, for the purpose of filing our Registration Statement with the SEC and preparing our audit, December 31, 2014 as our fiscal year end.

We are a full-service multi-media Company with a multi operational approach focusing on Online video and photography content development and distribution and Website and mobile app technology integration design and development. Websites are a unique mix of textual content, photos, sometimes video and often times apps, which are designed as plug-ins to websites or for mobile devices, aiding in the conveyance of a website's message whether it be business related or personal. We offer products and solutions to help our customers stand out in the ever-changing internet environment.  We have been, initially, capitalized through the acquisition of Assets from our founding shareholder, cash flows from multi media operations and the proceeds from a Private Placement offering. 

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue consists substantially of fees earned from movies and videos that we have interests in and commercial video work. We recognize revenue from a sale or licensing arrangement of a film when all of the following conditions are met: non-refundable payment for film rights per a contract, or; persuasive evidence of a sale or licensing arrangement with a customer exists; the film is complete and, in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, has been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery; the license period of the arrangement has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation, exhibition, or sale; the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable; and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from commercial video services rendered when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured upon invoicing for work.

12 

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates.

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, we used $(4,787) cash in operating activities compared to $67,688 in cash provided by operating activities and paid in capital in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a loss of $(7,158) which was increased for cash flow purposes by $3,432 in non-cash expenses and reduced further by a net decrease to income tax payable of $1,061.

By comparison, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a profit of $32,517 which was increased for cash flow purposes by $12,963 consisting in non-cash expenses of $933, accounts receivable of (25,000), film equipment of $(21,225), accounts payable of $20,000 and non-cash increase of Income tax payable of $5,738 and increased further by a net increase in paid in capital and stock for services of $54,725.

Investing Activities

For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we had $0 and $21,225 respectively used for the purchase of film equipment. 

Financing Activities

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we neither generated nor used any funds in financing activities.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we generated funds in financing activities of $54,725.

Going Concern

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The company has a total stockholder's equity of $92,402 as of September 30, 2016. However, there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its goals and sustain a profitable position.

The Company believes it may have sufficient cash resources available to fund its primary operation for the next twelve (12) months. The Company has no agreements in place with its shareholders, officer and director or with any third parties to fund operations beyond September 30, 2016. The Company has not negotiated nor has available to it any other third party sources of liquidity.

The Company has no, current, off balance sheet arrangements and does not anticipate entering into any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition.
