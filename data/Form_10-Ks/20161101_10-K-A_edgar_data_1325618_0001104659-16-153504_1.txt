  Iradimed Corporation (the  Company ) is filing this Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A (this  Amendment ) to amend the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 10, 2016 (the  Form 10-K ) to amend certain certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company  pursuant to Item 601(b)(31) of Regulation S-K, as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that were inadvertently misstated in both of Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 of the Form 10-K. 
     
  No other changes have been made to the Form 10-K. This Amendment speaks as of the original filing date of the Form 10-K and does not reflect events that may have occurred subsequent to the original filing date. This Amendment restates only those portions of the Form 10-K affected by the above noted changes. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Form 10-K and other filings made by the Company subsequent to our filing of the Form 10-K. As instructed by the SEC in a comment letter dated October 25, 2016, this Amendment includes only the amended certifications of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 attached hereto.
