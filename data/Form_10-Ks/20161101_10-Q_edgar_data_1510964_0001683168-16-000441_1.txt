1.   
       ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS    

CV Sciences, Inc. (the  Company, 
 we,   our  or  us ) was incorporated under the name Foreclosure Solutions, Inc. in the State
of Texas on December 9, 2010. On July 25, 2013, the Company s predecessor, CannaVest Corp., a Texas corporation ( CannaVest
Texas ), merged with the Company, a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of CannaVest Texas, to effectuate a change in the Company s
state of incorporation from Texas to Delaware. On January 4, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate
of Incorporation reflecting its corporate name change to  CV Sciences, Inc. , effective on January 5, 2016. In addition,
on January 4, 2016, the Company amended its Bylaws to reflect its corporate name change to  CV Sciences, Inc.  The
Company previously operated under the corporate name of CannaVest Corp. The change in corporate name was undertaken in connection
with the acquisition of CanX Inc., a Florida-based, specialty pharmaceutical corporation ( CanX Acquisition ) as more
fully set forth in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
on January 4, 2016. On June 8, 2016 the Company announced that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA )
had approved a change in the trading symbol for the Company s common stock to  CVSI.  The Company s common
stock formerly traded under the symbol  CANV.  

The Company operates two distinct business
segments: a consumer product segment in manufacturing, marketing and selling plant-based Cannabidiol ( CBD ) products
to a range of market sectors; and, a specialty pharmaceutical segment focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics
utilizing synthetic CBD. The specialty pharmaceutical segment began development activities during the second quarter of 2016. 

2.   
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Basis of Presentation    
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CV Sciences, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries US
Hemp Oil, LLC, CannaVest Laboratories, LLC, Plus CBD, LLC and CANNAVEST Acquisition, LLC; and the accounts of a 70% interest in
CannaVest Europe, GmbH (collectively, the  Company ). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. The Company commenced commercial operations for its current business model on January 29, 2013. On May 2, 2016,
the Company filed Articles of Dissolution for its wholly-owned subsidiaries US Hemp Oil, LLC and CannaVEST Laboratories, LLC, with
the Secretary of State of Nevada, effective as of April 29, 2016. Neither US Hemp Oil, LLC nor CannaVEST Laboratories, LLC had
any assets or liabilities. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The information furnished
herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management,
necessary to fairly present the operating results for the respective periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( GAAP ) have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes for the year ended December
31, 2015, filed with the SEC on the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016. The results for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending
December 31, 2016. 

Change in Accounting Policy    
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company changed its accounting policy for shipping and handling costs from sales
of Company products. Under the new accounting policy, these costs are included in cost of goods sold, whereas, they were previously
included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Including these expenses in cost of goods sold better aligns these costs
with the related revenue in the gross profit calculation. This accounting policy change has been applied retrospectively. 

The Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been reclassified to reflect this change in accounting policy.
The impact of this reclassification was an increase of $111,391 to cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30,
2015 and a corresponding decrease to selling, general and administrative expenses in the same period. The impact of this reclassification
was an increase of $235,213 to cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and a corresponding decrease to
selling, general and administrative expenses in the same period. This reclassification had no impact on Net Sales, Operating Loss,
Net Loss or Net Loss per Share. 

Liquidity     For the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a net loss of $1,900,736 and $989,549, respectively. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a net loss of $5,660,755 and $5,641,426, respectively. In addition, for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had negative cash flows from operations of $1,429,277 and $2,924,177,
respectively. Management believes the Company has the funds needed to continue its consumer product business segment and meet its
other obligations over the next year solely from current revenues and cash flow due to increased sales and because our current
inventory levels are sufficient to support sales through the third quarter of 2017, resulting in reduced cash outflow for inventory
purchases. In addition, we do not intend to purchase raw inventory from our supply chain arrangements from the 2016 crop. 

The Company s specialty pharmaceutical
business segment will require additional capital of approximately $1,500,000 over the next 12 months. Management believes that
it will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the Company, however, there can be no assurances that the Company
will be successful. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, the Company would likely be forced to curtail pharmaceutical
development. 

Business Combinations   
 We apply the provisions of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805,  Business Combinations  ( ASC
805 ), in the accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring
the total consideration transferred to and the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests in the acquired
target in an asset purchase. ASC 805 requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred
over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates
and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration,
where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period,
which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with
the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets
acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements
of operations. 

Accounting for business combinations requires
our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible
assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although
we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part
on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. 

Examples of critical estimates in valuing
certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: 

future expected cash flow from supply chain
        relationships with growers and processors of our hemp extracted CBD oil;   

expected costs to develop the In-process
        Research and Development ( IPR D ) into commercially viable pharmaceutical products and estimated cash flows from
        the projects when completed;   

the acquired company s brand, trade
        names and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in
        the combined Company s product portfolio; and   

discount rates.   

Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
  The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets annually during the fourth quarter in accordance
with ASC 350  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other  and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could
include, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition,
or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, the Company compares the fair
value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount, including goodwill.
The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the
market approach, which utilizes comparable companies  data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. The impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair
value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill, the
fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values.
The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair
value of goodwill. 

We make critical assumptions and estimates
in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into
the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market
competition, inflation and discount rates. 

We classify intangible assets into three
categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not
subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering
the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include
the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, our long-term strategy for
using the asset, any laws or regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset and other economic factors, including
competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on
a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally five years. IPR D has an indefinite
life and is not amortized until completion and development of the project, at which time the IPR D becomes an amortizable asset.
If the related project is not completed in a timely manner or the project is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have an impairment
related to the IPR D, calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. The intangible assets
with estimable useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated
residual values. This method of amortization approximates the expected future cash flow generated from their use. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no impairments. 

Use of Estimates    
The Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, including those related
to contingencies, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. Significant estimates include the valuation of intangible assets, the amortization lives
of intangible assets, valuation of contingent consideration, inputs for valuing warrants, a note payable beneficial conversion
feature and stock-based compensation, and the allowance for doubtful accounts. It is at least reasonably possible that a change
in the estimates will occur in the near term. 

Reportable Segment    
With the recent CanX Acquisition, the Company has two business segments; consumer products and specialty pharmaceutical. Our consumer
products segment develops, manufactures and markets products based on plant-based CBD, including under the name  PlusCBD  
in a variety of market sectors including nutraceutical, beauty care, specialty foods and vape. Our specialty pharmaceutical segment
is newly established to develop a variety of drug candidates which use synthetic CBD as a primary active ingredient. The specialty
pharmaceutical segment began development activities during the second quarter of 2016. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  
  For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers amounts held by financial institutions
and short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. At
each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk  
  As of September 30, 2016, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) provided insurance coverage of
up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe that the
Company is exposed to significant risks from excess deposits. The Company s cash balance in excess of FDIC limits totaled
$547,221 at September 30, 2016. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had
two notes receivable totaling $540,351, one of which is from sale of inventory to Medical Marijuana, Inc. ( MJNA ),
and the second note is from a litigation settlement with MJNA (Note 3). 

One customer represented 60.5% of our accounts
receivable balance at September 30, 2016 and two customers represented 83% of our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2015. 

Accounts Receivable    
Generally, the Company requires payment prior to shipment. However, in certain circumstances, the Company provides credit to companies
located throughout the U.S. Accounts receivable consists of trade accounts arising in the normal course of business. Accounts receivable
for large accounts are generally secured. Smaller accounts receivable, generally less than $10,000, are unsecured and no interest
is charged on past due accounts. Accounts for which no payments have been received after 30 days are considered delinquent and
customary collection efforts are initiated. Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less a reserve made for
doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a quarterly basis. 

Management has determined the allowance
for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition
and credit history, and current economic conditions. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded an
allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable in the amount of $100,000. 

Revenue Recognition   - The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition  which requires persuasive evidence
of an arrangement, delivery of a product or service, a fixed or determinable price and assurance of collection within a reasonable
period of time. The Company records revenue when goods are delivered to customers and the rights of ownership have transferred
from the Company to the customer. 

In the normal course of business, the Company
may offer discounts or promotions for various products to incentivize sales growth and brand awareness. Such discounts or promotions
are recorded as a reduction to sales revenue. 

Sales Tax     The Company
is responsible for collecting tax on sales to end customers and remitting these taxes to applicable jurisdictions. These taxes
are assessed based on the location of the end customer and the laws of the jurisdiction in which they reside. 

Shipping and Handling    
Shipping and handling costs totaled $115,990 and $111,391 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Shipping and handling costs totaled $313,498 and $235,213 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Shipping and handling costs are recorded in cost of goods sold. 

Returns      Finished
Products    Within ten (10) days of a customer s receipt of the Company s finished products, the customer
may return (i) finished products that do not conform to the Company s product specifications, or (ii) finished products which
are defective, provided that notice of condition is given within five (5) days of the customer s receipt of the finished
products. The failure to comply with the foregoing time requirements shall be deemed a waiver of the customer s claim for
incorrect or defective shipments. In the event of the existence of one or more material defects in any finished product upon delivery
to the customer, the Company shall, at its sole option and cost, either (a) take such measures as are required to cure the defect(s)
designated in the notice, or (b) replace such defective finished product(s). The Company may, at its sole option, require the return
or destruction of the defective finished products. The customer shall afford the Company the opportunity to verify that such defects
existed prior to shipment and were not, for purposes of example and not limitation, the result of improper transport, handling,
storage, product rotation or misuse by the customer. 

Bulk Oil Products    Sales
of bulk oil products are generally final, and beginning in 2015 the Company does not accept returns under any circumstances. 

There is no allowance for customer returns
at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015 due to insignificant return amounts experienced during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Compensation and Benefits  
  The Company records compensation and benefits expense for all cash and deferred compensation, benefits, and related taxes
as earned by its employees. Compensation and benefits expense also includes compensation earned by temporary employees and contractors
who perform similar services to those performed by the Company s employees, primarily information technology and project
management activities. 

Stock-Based Compensation  
  Certain employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company participate in various long-term incentive plans
that provide for granting stock options and restricted stock awards. Stock options generally vest in equal increments over a two-
to four-year period and expire on the tenth anniversary following the date of grant. Performance based stock options vest once
the applicable performance condition is satisfied. Restricted stock awards generally vest 100% at the grant date. 

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation
for equity awards granted to employees, officers, and directors as compensation and benefits expense on the condensed consolidated
statements of operations. The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant.
The fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the closing price of the Company s stock on the date of grant. Stock-based
compensation is recognized over the requisite service period of the individual awards, which generally equals the vesting period.
For performance based stock options, compensation is recognized once the applicable performance condition is satisfied. 

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation
for equity awards granted to consultants as selling, general and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statements
of operations. The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant and unvested
awards are revalued at each reporting period. The fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the closing price of the Company s
stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares awarded. Stock-based compensation is recognized over the requisite
service period of the individual awards, which generally equals the vesting period. 

Inventory     Inventory
is stated at lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on average cost basis. There was no reserve for obsolete inventory
as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $1,326,911 of inventory in Germany and
the Netherlands. 

Property   Equipment  
  Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost represents the purchase price of the asset and other costs
incurred to bring the asset into its existing use. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets  estimated
useful lives. Tenant improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the related lease. Maintenance
or repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale or disposition, the historically-recorded asset cost and accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts and the net amount less proceeds from disposal is charged or credited to other income (expense). 

Property and equipment, net, as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

Depreciation expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $48,977 and $47,678, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
was $146,692 and $141,222, respectively. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
  In accordance with ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments , the Company calculates the fair value of its assets and
liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to its financial statements
when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. The estimated fair value of the Company s
current assets and current liabilities approximates their carrying amount due to their readily available nature and short maturity. 

Long-Lived Assets    
In accordance with ASC Topic 360,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company reviews property
and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of property and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected
future cash flows that the asset(s) are expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable, we recognize
an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset over its respective fair value, which is
generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or at the appraised value. The impairment analysis is
based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. Circumstances
that may lead to impairment of property and equipment include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset,
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition and
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset including
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. 

Debt Issuance Costs    
Debt issuance costs have been recorded as a discount to secured convertible and unsecured promissory notes payable and are being
amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the expected terms of the related debt agreements. 

Loss per Share     The
Company calculates earning or loss per share ( EPS ) in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share , which
requires the computation and disclosure of two EPS amounts, basic and diluted. Basic EPS is computed based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding plus all potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company
had 11,924,776 and 9,258,888 of stock options outstanding that are anti-dilutive at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively. In addition, the Company may be required to issue 11,000,000 shares of common stock related to certain performance
based stock options outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, there were also warrants outstanding to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares
of common stock. The Company may also be required to issue up to 19,500,000 shares of common stock related to contingent consideration
from the CanX Acquisition and a variable amount of shares of common stock related to the potential conversion feature of the Iliad
Note (as defined below) (Note 8). 

Research and Development Expense  
  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and include, but are not limited to, employee salaries
and benefits, cost of inventory used in product development, consulting service fees, the cost of renting and maintaining our laboratory
facility and depreciation of laboratory equipment. Research and development expense for the consumer products segment was $292,738
and $658,817 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Research and development expense for the specialty
pharmaceutical segment was $103,500 and $220,781 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Income Taxes     Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized when the rate change is enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. In accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income
Taxes , the Company recognizes the effect of uncertain income tax positions only if the positions are more likely than not of
being sustained in an audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Recognized uncertain income tax positions are measured
at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in
the period in which those changes in judgment occur. The Company recognizes both interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
positions as part of the income tax provision. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have a liability
for unrecognized tax uncertainties. The Company is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions. Management believes the Company
is no longer subject to tax examinations for the years prior to 2013. 

Recent Issued and Newly Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
 (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ), as amended by ASU 2015-14, which completes the joint effort by the FASB and the
International Accounting Standards Board to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP
and the International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018
and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014,  the
FASB  issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 )
requiring management to evaluate on a regular basis whether any conditions or events have arisen that could raise substantial doubt
about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 (1) provides a definition for the term  substantial
doubt,  (2) requires an evaluation every reporting period, interim periods included, (3) provides principles for considering
the mitigating effect of management s plans to alleviate the substantial doubt, (4) requires certain disclosures if the substantial
doubt is alleviated as a result of management s plans, (5) requires a statement in the footnotes that there is substantial
doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, as well as other disclosures, if the substantial doubt is
not alleviated, and (6) requires an assessment period of one year from the date the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15
is effective for the Company s reporting year beginning January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating
the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,
 Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ), which requires inventory measured using
any method other than last-in, first out or the retail inventory method to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or net
realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within such annual periods. Early application is permitted. The Company is evaluating
the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU
2015-16,  Business Combinations  ( ASU 2015-16 ), which simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments
by eliminating the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance
requires the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments, including the impact on prior periods, to be recognized in the
reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. ASU 2015-16 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any interim and annual
financial statements that have not yet been issued. The Company implemented this standard during the first quarter of 2016. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases  ( ASU 2016-02 ), which, for operating leases, requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and
a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires
a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally
straight-line basis. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this
guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation  ( ASU 2015-09 ), which involve multiple aspects of the accounting for
share-based transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the potential impact
of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (A Consensus of the FASB Emerging
Issues Task Force)  ( ASU 2016-15), which provides amendments to specific statement of cash flows classification issues.
ASU 2016-15 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

Other recent accounting pronouncements
issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the
SEC did not, or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements.  

3.   
       NOTES RECEIVABLE    

Notes receivable at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 was comprised of the following: 

The MJNA settlement note relates to an
agreement as reported in the Company s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 20, 2015 (the  July Form 8-K ). As
further discussed in the July Form 8-K, on July 14, 2015, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with MJNA, HempMeds PX,
LLC, Kannaway, LLC, General Hemp, LLC, HDDC Holdings, LLC, Rabbit Hole Technologies, Inc., Hemp Deposit and Distribution Corporation
and MJNA Holdings, LLC (collectively, the  MJNA Parties ) to settle multiple litigation matters between the Company
and the MJNA Parties (the  Settlement Agreement ). 

Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the
MJNA Parties paid the Company the sum of $150,000 and delivered a promissory note in the principal amount of $600,000 ( Settlement
Note ), bearing interest at the rate of 6% per annum, payable in six equal monthly installments of $101,757 commencing August
15, 2015. The promissory note was secured by shares of the Company s common stock held by the MJNA Parties. In November 2015,
MJNA failed to timely pay the fourth payment installment under the Settlement Note and therefore defaulted on the Settlement Note.
On December 3, 2015, the Company foreclosed on the Settlement Note collateral consisting of Company common stock. The foreclosure
resulted in the Company obtaining rights to receive 624,750 shares of its common stock in full satisfaction of the remaining principal
and accrued interest balance. At the foreclosure date, the Company took immediate possession of 500,000 shares held in escrow.
At September 30, 2016, the Company was arranging to obtain the remaining 124,750 shares as collateral under the Settlement Note.
The Settlement Note balance of $60,351 at each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 represents the fair value at the foreclosure
date of the remaining 124,750 shares. 

In August 2015, we entered into an agreement
to sell MJNA our products and received from MJNA a promissory note in the principal amount of $2,002,910 ( MJNA Promissory
Note ) that was to be paid in 12 equal installments beginning on November 3, 2015 in exchange for the product shipped to
MJNA. The MJNA Promissory Note is secured by 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock held in escrow. MJNA has failed
to make any payments on the MJNA Promissory Note and is in default. The MJNA Promissory Note is likely not collectible, and the
probable form of collection is for the Company to foreclose on the 2,000,000 shares of Company common stock. At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of the collateral was determined to be $480,000 equal to the $0.24 per share closing
price of the Company s common stock as of December 31, 2015, multiplied by the 2,000,000 shares of Company common stock. 

The MediJane Holdings, Inc. ( MJMD )
note relates to the sale of Company products during December 2014 in exchange for a convertible promissory note in the amount of
$1,200,000 ( MJMD Note ). The full amount of the MJMD Note was due on June 23, 2015 along with accrued interest at
10%. MJMD was unable to secure financing in support of its operations and was not able to sell or otherwise commercialize the Company
products purchased. In February 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the MJMD Note, providing for the return of Company
products previously sold to MJMD. A portion of the Company products previously sold to MJMD were returned to the Company in February
2016 with the remaining products returned in June 2016. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of the remaining
Company products to be returned was determined to be $0 and $77,330, respectively, equal to the cost value of the Company products
to be returned, reduced by $9,218, which was recorded as a bad debt expense in 2016. 

4.   
       INVENTORY    

Inventory at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 was comprised of the following: 

5.   
       ACCRUED EXPENSES    

Accrued expenses at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

6.   
       INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET    

Intangible assets consisted of the following
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Amortization expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $214,350 and $205,500, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 totaled $643,050 and $616,500, respectively. 

7.   
       RELATED PARTIES    

Total receivables from MJNA totaled $540,351
at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid $149,531 and $755,072, respectively, to a stockholder of the Company who is a supplier of hemp
oil and hemp to the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid the same stockholder of
the Company $252,509 and $5,372,133, respectively. In addition, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company issued 500,000 shares
of common stock in connection with consulting services from a European supplier valued based on the closing trading price of the
Company s common stock on the date of issuance. 

8.   
       NOTES PAYABLE    

Secured Convertible Promissory
Notes Payable    

On May 19, 2015 (the  Closing Date ),
the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) with Redwood Management, LLC (the  Investor 
or  Redwood ) pursuant to which the Investor committed to lend to the Company up to $6,500,000 (the  Financing ). 

During the year ended December 31, 2015,
the Company issued four tranches of convertible promissory notes ( Notes ) in the aggregate principal amount of $1,785,000
to the Investor and other third parties who were assigned rights by the Investor to participate in the Financing (together with
the Investor, the  Investors ). During the first quarter of 2016, the Company repaid all remaining obligations under
the SPA and has no intention of seeking further capital from the Investor, or any other investor(s) in the Financing. 

The Company s
borrowings and conversions under the SPA for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31,
2015 is summarized in the table below: 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company repaid the remaining principal and interest balance under the Notes as follows: (i) issued 3,062,535 shares
of its common stock to the Investors in connection with conversion of the remaining $255,000 principal balance of Promissory Note
2; (ii) repaid $357,000 of the aggregate principal amount of Promissory Note 3 plus interest in the amount of $148,944 in cash
to the Investors, and issued 2,500,000 shares of its common stock to the Investors in connection with the conversion of the remaining
principal amount of $153,000 of Promissory Note 3; and, (iii) repaid the entire principal amount of Promissory Note 4 in the amount
of $255,000 plus interest in the amount of $93,075 in cash to the Investors. 

On May 25, 2016 (the  Purchase Price
Date ), the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( Iliad SPA ) with Iliad Research and Trading,
L.P. (the  Lender  or  Iliad ) pursuant to which the Lender loaned the Company $2,000,000. On the Purchase
Price Date, the Company issued to Lender a Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the  Iliad Note ) in the principal
amount of $2,055,000 in exchange for payment by Lender of $2,000,000. The principal sum of the Iliad Note reflects the amount
invested, plus a 2.25%  Original Issue Discount  ( OID ) and a $10,000 reimbursement of Lender s
legal fees. Out of the proceeds from the Iliad Note, the Company paid the sum of $25,000 to its placement agent, Myers   Associates,
L.P. The Company received net proceeds of $1,975,000 in exchange for the Iliad Note. The Iliad Note requires the repayment of
all principal and any interest, fees, charges and late fees on the date that is thirteen months after the Purchase Price Date
(the  Maturity Date ). Interest is to be paid on the outstanding balance at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum
from the Purchase Price Date until the Iliad Note is paid in full. Interest is accrued during the term of the Iliad Note and all
interest calculations shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve (12) thirty (30)-day months and shall
compound daily. Subject to adjustment as set forth in the Iliad Note, the conversion price for each Lender conversion shall be
$0.50 (the  Lender Conversion Price ), convertible into shares of fully paid and non-assessable common stock. Beginning
on the date that is six months after the Purchase Price Date and continuing until the Maturity Date, Iliad shall have the right
to redeem a portion of the Iliad Note in any amount up to the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount ($275,000, which is the maximum
aggregate redemption amount that may be redeemed in any calendar month), for which payments may be made in cash or by converting
the redemption amount into shares of Company common stock at a conversion price which is the lesser of (a) the Lender Conversion
Price of $0.50 and (b) the Market Price, defined as 70% ( the Conversion Factor ), subject to adjustment as follows:
if at any time (1) the average of the three lowest closing bid prices in the previous twenty (20) trading days is below $0.25
per share then the Conversion Factor will be reduced by 10%, (2) the Company is not Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian eligible,
then the Conversion Factor will be reduced by an additional 5%, or (3) there has occurred a  Major Default  then the
Conversion Factor will be reduced by an additional 5%. The Company may prepay the Iliad Note at any time by payment to Lender
of 125% of the principal, interest and other amounts then due under the Note. The Company may prepay the Iliad Note notwithstanding
an earlier notice of conversion from the Lender, provided that in such event the Lender may convert an amount not to exceed $300,000
under the Iliad Note. In connection with the Iliad Note, as set forth above, the Company incurred an original issue discount of
$45,000 and $35,000 of other debt issuance costs, which will be amortized over the Iliad Note term. The Iliad Note is securitized
by the Company s accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. 

The Company s borrowing under the
Iliad Note for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 is summarized in the table below: 

Due to the variability in potential convertible
common shares, the Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature of $370,000 at the time of the transaction, which will be amortized
over six months. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded interest expense of $185,000 and
$262,581, respectively for amortization of the beneficial conversion feature. The assumptions used by the Company for calculating
the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature using the Binomial Lattice valuation model were: (i) Volatility of 74.0%; (ii)
Risk-Free Interest Rate of 0.44%; and (iii) Expected Term of five months. 

Unsecured Note Payable    

On January 29, 2016, the Company issued
an unsecured promissory note to a lender in the principal amount of $850,000 ( Promissory Note ) in consideration of
a loan provided to the Company by the lender. The Promissory Note bears interest at 12% per annum, and the Company is obligated
to make monthly interest-only payments in the amount of $8,500, for which the interest-only payments obligation commenced on March
1, 2016. All principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due under the Promissory Note on February 1, 2018. The Company has the
right to prepay the Promissory Note without penalty or premium. In connection with the Promissory Note, the Company incurred an
original issue discount of $30,000 and $18,570 of other debt issuance costs, which will be amortized over the Promissory Note term. 

The Company s borrowing under the
Promissory Note for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 is summarized below: 

Pursuant to the terms of the Promissory
Note, the Company issued to the lender a common stock purchase warrant providing the lender with the right to purchase up to 2,000,000
shares of the Company s common stock (the  Warrant ). The Warrant is exercisable, subject to certain limitations,
subsequent to July 1, 2017 and before the date that is five years from the date of issuance at an exercise price of $0.20 per share,
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events such as stock splits and dividends. The Company recorded the fair value
of the Warrant of $266,800 as a debt discount associated with the Promissory Note. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company recorded interest expense of $33,350 and $88,933, respectively, for amortization of the Warrant fair value.
The assumptions used by the Company for calculating the fair value of the Warrant using the Black-Scholes valuation model were:
(i) Volatility of 83.3%; (ii) Risk-Free Interest Rate of 2.12%; and (iii) Expected Term of five years.

       COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    

Commitments   

The Company has non-cancelable operating
leases, which expire through 2017. The leases generally contain renewal options ranging from 1 to 3 years and require the Company
to pay costs such as real estate taxes and common area maintenance. The following table provides the Company s lease commitments
at September 30, 2016: 

The Company incurred rent expense of $120,162

rights for the growth and processing of hemp oil for delivery through October 2018 under both of these contracts. We anticipate
the cost under both contracts will remain consistent with current year prices. 

Contingencies   

On April 23, 2014, Tanya
Sallustro filed a purported class action complaint (the  Complaint ) in the Southern District of New York (the  Court )
alleging securities fraud and related claims against the Company and certain of its officers and directors and seeking compensatory
damages including litigation costs. Ms. Sallustro alleges that between March 18-31, 2014, she purchased 325 shares of the Company s
common stock for a total investment of $15,791. The Complaint refers to Current Reports on Form 8-K and Current Reports on Form
8-K/A filings made by the Company on April 3, 2014 and April 14, 2014, in which the Company amended previously disclosed sales
(sales originally stated at $1,275,000 were restated to $1,082,375 - reduction of $192,625) and restated goodwill as $1,855,512
(previously reported at net zero). Additionally, the Complaint states after the filing of the Company s Current Report on
Form 8-K on April 3, 2014 and the following press release, the Company s stock price  fell $7.30 per share, or more
than 20%, to close at $25.30 per share.  Subsequent to the filing of the Complaint, six different individuals filed a motion
asking to be designated the lead plaintiff in the litigation. On March 19, 2015, the Court issued a ruling appointing Steve
Schuck as lead plaintiff.  Counsel for Mr. Schuck filed a  consolidated amended complaint  on September 14, 2015.
On December 11, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.  After requesting several
extensions, counsel for Mr. Schuck filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on March 21, 2016.  The Company s reply
brief was filed on April 25, 2016.  Defendant Stuart Titus was served with the Summons   Complaint in the case and he
has recently completed briefing his motion to dismiss, through separate counsel. No hearing date has been set by the Court at this
time with respect to the motions to dismiss.  Management intends to vigorously defend the allegations and an estimate of possible
loss cannot be made at this time. 

On March 17, 2015, stockholder
Michael Ruth filed a shareholder derivative suit in Nevada District Court alleging two causes of action: 1) Breach of Fiduciary
Duty, and 2)  Gross Mismanagement.  The claims are premised on the same event as the already-pending securities class
action case in New York discussed above   it is alleged that the Form 8-K filings misstated goodwill and sales of the Company,
which when corrected, lead to a significant drop in stock price. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the suit on June 29, 2015. 
Instead of opposing the Company s motion, Mr. Ruth filed an amended complaint on July 20, 2015.  Thereafter, Mr. Ruth
and the Company agreed to stay the action pending the outcome of the securities class action case in New York discussed above. 
Management intends to vigorously defend the allegations.  Since no discovery has been conducted and the case remains stayed,
an estimate of the possible loss or recovery cannot be made at this time. 

In the normal course of
business, the Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which they may be obligated to indemnify the other party.
It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional
nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments
made by us under these types of agreements have not had a material effect on our business, condensed consolidated results of operations
or financial condition. 

Royalties   

In addition to the contingent
consideration in connection with the CanX Acquisition (Note 1), which includes consideration for various milestones reached which
may require issuance of up to 19,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock, the Company is obligated to pay a 5% royalty
of net sales on each of the first and second CBD drug products, subject to, and commencing with the first commercial release by
the Company of each of the first and second CBD drug products by the Company formulated to treat human medical conditions. 

12.   
       SEGMENT INFORMATION    

The Company operates in two distinct business
segments: a consumer product segment in manufacturing, marketing and selling plant-based CBD products to a range of market sectors;
and, a specialty pharmaceutical segment focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics utilizing synthetic CBD. The
Company s segments maintain separate financial information for which operating results are evaluated on a regular basis by
the Company s senior management in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company evaluates
its consumer product segment based on net product sales, gross profit and operating income or loss. The Company currently evaluates
its specialty pharmaceutical segment based on the progress of its clinical development programs. 

The following table presents information
by reportable operating segment for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

In October 2016, the Company s
Board of Directors approved the issuance of 4,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock to former CanX shareholders upon
completion of the development of a U.S. Food   Drug Administration (the  FDA ) current good manufacturing practice
grade batch of successfully synthetically formulated  ready to ship  CBD for use in drug development activities. 

In addition, in connection
with the completion of the development of an FDA current good manufacturing practice grade batch of successfully synthetically
formulated  ready to ship  CBD for use in drug development activities, an aggregate 2,750,000 options vested for three
members of senior management. 

In October
2016, the Company s shareholders  approved  an amendment to  the Amended 2013 Plan
 to increase the number of common stock  shares issuable from 1 5,000,000
to 20,000,000 authorized shares.  

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations for the interim period ended September 30, 2016, should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our discussion
includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives,
expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   plan, 
 project,   continuing,   ongoing,   expect,   believe,   intend, 
 may,   will,   should,   could,  and similar expressions to identify forward-looking
statements. 

OVERVIEW  

We are a life science company with two
distinct business segments. Our consumer product business segment is focused on manufacturing, marketing and selling plant-based
Cannabidiol ( CBD ) products to a range of market sectors. Our specialty pharmaceutical business segment is focused
on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics utilizing synthetic CBD. 

Our pharmaceutical business segment is
developing synthetic cannabinoids to treat a range of medical conditions. The Company s product candidates are based on proprietary
formulations, processes and technology that we believe are patent-protectable, and we plan to vigorously pursue patent protection
on the Company s two drug candidates. 

Our consumer product business segment manufactures,
markets and sells consumer products containing plant-based CBD under our PlusCBD  brand in a range of market sectors including
nutraceutical, beauty care, specialty foods and vape. 

We expect to realize revenue from our consumer
products business segment to fund a portion of our working capital needs. However, in order to fund our pharmaceutical product
development efforts, we will need to raise additional capital through either the issuance of equity and/or debt. Given the small
size of our company and the development stage of our pharmaceutical business segment, we may find it difficult to raise sufficient
capital to meet our needs. We do not have any firm commitments for all of our capital needs, and there are no assurances they will
be available to us. If we are unable to access capital as necessary, our ability to generate revenues and to continue as a going
concern will be in jeopardy. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

We currently focus on Adjusted EBITDA to
evaluate our business relationships and our resulting operating performance and financial position. Adjusted EBITDA is defined
as EBITDA (net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization), further adjusted to exclude certain
non-cash expenses and other adjustments as set forth below. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important measure
of our performance and it is a meaningful financial metric in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding
certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business, such as certain non-cash items and other adjustments. 

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed
in addition to, and not in lieu of our reported results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ( GAAP ), provides useful information to investors regarding our performance for the following reasons: 

because non-cash equity grants made to employees and non-employees at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time, stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance; and   

revenues and expenses associated with acquisitions, dispositions, equity issuance and related offering costs can vary from period to period and transaction to transaction and are not considered a key measure of our operating performance.   

We used Adjusted EBITDA: 

as a measure of operating performance;   

to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and   

in communication with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance   

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and
does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities
as a measure of liquidity. The term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income
(loss), operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. 

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical
tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these
limitations are: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual requirements;   

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and   

Adjusted EBITDA can differ significantly from company to company depending on strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, the level of capital investment, thus, limiting is usefulness as a comparative measure.   

Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered
as a measure of discretionary cash available to us for investment in our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying
primarily on GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental information. 

A reconciliation from our net loss to Adjusted
EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and is detailed below:

      Represents income from settlement with Medical Marijuana, Inc. ( MJNA ) and certain MJNA parties.   

Critical Accounting Policies  

We have disclosed in the notes to our consolidated
financial statements and in  Item 7   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations  included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, those accounting policies that we consider to be significant
in determining our results of operation and financial condition. There have been no material changes to those policies that we
consider to be significant since the filing of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting principles used in preparing
our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to GAAP. 

During the first quarter of fiscal year
2016, the Company changed its accounting policy for shipping and handling costs from sales of Company products. Under the new accounting
policy, these costs are included in cost of goods sold, whereas, they were previously included in selling, general and administrative
expenses. Including these expenses in cost of goods sold better aligns these costs with the related revenue in the gross profit
calculation. This accounting policy change has been applied retrospectively and had no impact on Net Sales, Operating Loss, Net
Loss or Net Loss per Share. 

On June 8, 2016 the Company changed its
trading symbol from CANV to CVSI, and continues to be traded on the OTC: Bulletin Board.

condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Results of Operations  

Three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Revenues and gross profit  
- We had sales of $2,939,997 and gross profit of $1,888,949, representing a gross profit percentage of 64.3% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared with sales of $4,151,180 and gross profit of $2,458,797, representing a gross profit percentage
of 59.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. When excluding the Company s one-time $2,000,000 sale of products
to MJNA during the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company increased sales by $788,817 during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 when compared with the same period in 2015, on an as adjusted basis. As further discussed in Note 3 in the accompanying
notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, in August 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell MJNA our products
and received from MJNA a promissory note in the principal amount of $2,002,910 ( MJNA Promissory Note ) that was to
be paid in 12 equal installments beginning on November 3, 2015 in exchange for the product shipped to MJNA. MJNA has failed to
make any payments on the MJNA Promissory Note and is in default. 

The sales increase, on an as adjusted basis,
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to lower bulk oil and product pricing and a change in sales mix
in 2016 compared with 2015. Our current sales mix is more heavily weighted to branded finished products as compared to our historical
focus on bulk oil sales. The gross margin increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period
in 2015, is due to the change in sales mix and greater harvest and processing yields, which resulted in lower production costs
for bulk oil and finished products. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we had sales of $7,850,430 and gross profit of $5,178,911, representing a gross profit percentage of 66.0% compared with
sales of $9,279,117 and gross profit of $5,365,497, representing a gross profit of 57.8% for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. When excluding the Company s one-time $2,000,000 sale of products to MJNA during the nine months ended September 30,
2015, the Company increased sales by $571,313 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared with the same period
in 2015, on an as adjusted basis. The same factors impacting the third quarter of 2016 discussed above - lower prices and the change
in strategy from reliance on bulk oil sales to a consumer products business model - contributed to the sales increase for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015, on an as adjusted basis. Similarly, the gross margin increase for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, is due to the change in sales mix and greater harvest and processing
yields, which resulted in lower production costs for bulk oil and finished products. 

Selling, general and administrative
expenses   - For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred selling, general and administrative
(the  SG A ) expenses in the amount of $3,072,441 and $3,888,898, respectively. SG A expense for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes $647,977 and $1,746,440, respectively, of stock-based compensation, a non-cash
expense. The SG A expenses include $48,977 and $47,678 of depreciation expense, and, $214,350 and $205,500 of amortization
expense of intangible assets, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. After adjusting for non-cash
stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, SG A costs increased by $271,857 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Part of this increase
resulted from $119,908 of expense related to our specialty pharmaceutical segment, which began operations in the second quarter
of 2016, and increased headcount, commissions, marketing and employee benefits expenses. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company incurred SG A expenses in the amount of $9,147,411 compared with $10,716,814 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes $1,898,810 and $3,448,715, respectively,
of stock-based compensation, a non-cash expense. SG A expenses also includes $146,692 and $141,222 of depreciation expense,
and, $643,050 and $616,500 of amortization expense of intangible assets, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. After adjusting for non-cash stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, SG A
costs decreased by $51,518 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The decrease primarily
resulted from a decrease in computer and IT and free samples marketing expense. 

Research and development expenses
  - For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred research and development ( R D )
expenses of $396,238 and $228,822, respectively. These expenses are related to the cost of process development, rental of our laboratory
facility, payroll expenses, laboratory supplies, product development and testing, outsourced research personnel, and R D expenses
related to our specialty pharmaceutical segment. During the third quarter of 2016, we incurred $103,500 of R D expenses related
to our specialty pharmaceutical segment. We also incurred $0 and $7,364 of stock-based compensation during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. After adjusting for the specialty pharmaceutical R D expense and the non-cash stock-based
compensation, R D costs related to our consumer products segment increased by $71,280. This increase resulted primarily from
the domestic production of CBD. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company incurred R D expenses of $879,598 compared with $972,844 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These
expenses are related to the cost of process development, rental of our laboratory facility, payroll expenses, laboratory supplies,
product development and testing, outsourced research personnel and R D expenses related to our specialty pharmaceutical segment
for the period. R D expenses includes $220,781 related to our specialty pharmaceutical segment for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. We also incurred $0 and $28,877 of stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
After adjusting for the specialty pharmaceutical R D expenses and the non-cash stock-based compensation expense, R D costs
related to our consumer products segment decreased by $285,150. This decrease resulted primarily from the Company transitioning
R D activities in its consumer product segment into production of consumer products. 

Interest income/expense    
Interest income was $0 and $36,939 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest
income is due to interest earned on the issuance of notes receivable in 2015. Interest expense was $321,006 and $116,509 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015 relates
primarily to interest on the Company s notes payable. The increase in interest expense for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 was due to increased borrowings, accrued interest and the amortizations of debt
discounts and the beneficial conversion feature. 

Interest income was $27,658 and $107,427
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest income is due to interest earned
on the issuance of notes receivable in 2015. Interest expense was $840,315 and $132,633 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same
period in 2015 was due to increased borrowings, accrued interest and the amortizations of debt discounts and the beneficial conversion
feature. 

Litigation settlement income  
  Litigation revenue of $756,714 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 relates to the Company s settlement
agreement with Medical Marijuana, Inc., HempMeds PX, LLC, Kannaway, LLC, General Hemp, LLC, HDDC Holdings, LLC, Rabbit Hole Technologies,

On January 29, 2016, the Company issued
an unsecured promissory note to a lender in the principal amount of $850,000 ( Promissory Note ). The Promissory Note
bears interest at 12% per annum, and the Company is obligated to make monthly interest-only payments in the amount of $8,500, commencing
March 1, 2016. All principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due under the Promissory Note on February 1, 2018. The Company
has the right to prepay the Promissory Note without penalty or premium. In connection with the Promissory Note, the Company incurred
an original issue discount of $30,000 and $18,570 of other debt issuance costs, which will be amortized over the Promissory Note
term. 

On May 25, 2016 (the  Purchase Price
Date ), the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( Iliad SPA ) with Iliad Research and Trading,
L.P. (the  Lender  or  Iliad ) pursuant to which the Lender loaned the Company $2,000,000. On the Purchase
Price Date, the Company issued to Lender a Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the  Iliad Note ) in the principal
amount of $2,055,000 in exchange for payment by Lender of $2,000,000. The principal sum of the Iliad Note reflects the amount invested,
plus a 2.25%  Original Issue Discount  ( OID ) and a $10,000 reimbursement of Lender s legal fees.
Out of the proceeds from the Iliad Note, the Company paid the sum of $25,000 to its placement agent, Myers   Associates, L.P.
The Company received net proceeds of $1,975,000 in exchange for the Iliad Note. The Iliad Note requires the repayment of all principal
and any interest, fees, charges and late fees on the date that is thirteen months after the Purchase Price Date (the  Maturity
Date ). Interest is to be paid on the outstanding balance at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the Purchase Price
Date until the Iliad Note is paid in full. Interest is accrued during the term of the Iliad Note and all interest calculations
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve (12) thirty (30)-day months and shall compound daily. Subject
to adjustment as set forth in the Iliad Note, the conversion price for each Lender conversion shall be $0.50 (the  Lender
Conversion Price ), convertible into shares of fully paid and non-assessable common stock. Beginning on the date that is
six months after the Purchase Price Date and continuing until the Maturity Date, Iliad shall have the right to redeem a portion
of the Iliad Note in any amount up to the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount ($275,000, which is the maximum aggregate redemption
amount that may be redeemed in any calendar month), for which payments may be made in cash or by converting the redemption amount
into shares of Company common stock at a conversion price which is the lesser of (a) the Lender Conversion Price of $0.50 and (b)
the Market Price, defined as 70% ( the Conversion Factor ), subject to adjustment as follows: if at any time (1) the
average of the three lowest closing bid prices in the previous twenty (20) trading days is below $0.25 per share then the Conversion
Factor will be reduced by 10%, (2) the Company is not Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian eligible, then the Conversion Factor will
be reduced by an additional 5%, or (3) there has occurred a  Major Default  then the Conversion Factor will be reduced
by an additional 5%. The Company may prepay the Iliad Note at any time by payment to Lender of 125% of the principal, interest
and other amounts then due under the Note. The Company may prepay the Iliad Note notwithstanding an earlier notice of conversion
from the Lender, provided that in such event the Lender may convert an amount not to exceed $300,000 under the Iliad Note. In connection
with the Iliad Note, as set forth above, the Company incurred an original issue discount of $45,000 and $35,000 of other debt issuance
costs, which will be amortized over the Iliad Note term. The Iliad Note is securitized by the Company s accounts receivable,
inventory and equipment. 

The Company has yet to attain a level of
operations which allows it to meet operating and working capital cash flow needs. We expect to realize revenue to fund a portion
of our working capital needs through the sale of finished products and raw materials to third parties. However, in order to fund
our pharmaceutical product development efforts, we will need to raise additional capital through either the issuance of equity
and/or debt. We expect to be dependent upon obtaining additional financing in order to adequately fund working capital, infrastructure
and expenses in order to execute plans for future operations so that we can achieve a level of revenue adequate to support our
cost structure, none of which can be assured. 

Liquidity   

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company had net losses of $1,900,736 and $989,549, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company had net losses of $5,660,755 and $5,641,426, respectively. In addition, for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had negative cash flows from operations of $1,429,277 and $2,924,177, respectively. Management believes
the Company has the funds needed to continue its consumer product business segment and meet its other obligations over the next
year solely from current revenues and cash flow due to increased sales and because our current inventory levels are sufficient
to support sales through the third quarter of 2017, resulting in reduced cash outflow for inventory purchases. In addition, we
do not intend to purchase raw inventory from our supply chain arrangements from the 2016 crop. 

The Company s pharmaceutical business
segment will require additional capital of approximately $1,500,000 over the next 12 months. Management believes that it will be
able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the Company, however, there can be no assurances that the Company will be
successful. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, the Company would likely be forced to curtail pharmaceutical
development. 

We expect to realize revenue to fund our
working capital needs for our consumer product business segment through the sale of raw and finished products to third parties.
However, we cannot be assured that our working capital needs to develop, launch, market and sell our products will be met through
the sale of raw and finished products to third parties. If not, we may not be able to maintain profitable operations. If we are
unable to maintain profitable operations sufficient to fund our business, we would need to raise additional capital through either
the issuance of debt or equity. In the event we are unable to maintain profitable operations or raise sufficient additional capital,
our ability to continue as a going concern would be in jeopardy and investors could lose all of their investment in the Company. 

Numerous other consumer products are currently
in development and we will continue to scale up our processing capability to accommodate new products in our pipeline. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has two supply arrangements
in place with European farmers to supply raw material in future years. The first arrangement contemplates growth and processing
of 2,600 kilograms of product and the second contract provides up to 1 million kilograms of raw product to the Company. At September
30, 2016, there was approximately $110,000 remaining to be paid under this second contract related to the 2015 crop. We have contractual
rights for the growth and processing of hemp oil for delivery through October 2018 under both of these contracts. We anticipate
the cost under both contracts will remain consistent with current year prices. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Not applicable to a  smaller reporting company 
as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Our management, which is comprised of one
person holding the offices of President and Chief Executive Officer and one person holding the offices of Chief Financial Officer
and Secretary, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term
is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report
(the  Evaluation Date ). Based on such evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective, at a reasonable assurance level, as of the Evaluation Date, to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in reports that we file or submit under that Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. 

An evaluation was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of the Company s management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s
procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, the Company used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework of 1992 (the  1992 COSO Framework ). 

Management is aware of and has identified
the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting: the Company has not completed implementation
of our procedures and internal control over financial reporting as set forth in the 2013 version of the 1992 COSO Framework. 

Remediation efforts to address this material
weakness in evaluation and implementation of internal controls over financial reporting, include the following: we have dedicated
resources to, and anticipate final adoption and implementation of the 2013 version of the 1992 COSO Framework by the end of 2016. 

A material weakness is a deficiency or
combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s
internal controls. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING  

Except as noted above, there was no change
in our internal control over financial reporting identified with our evaluation that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

On April 23, 2014, Tanya
Sallustro filed a purported class action complaint (the  Complaint ) in the Southern District of New York (the  Court )
alleging securities fraud and related claims against the Company and certain of its officers and directors and seeking compensatory
damages including litigation costs. Ms. Sallustro alleges that between March 18-31, 2014, she purchased 325 shares of the Company s
common stock for a total investment of $15,791. The Complaint refers to Current Reports on Form 8-K and Current Reports on Form
8-K/A filings made by the Company on April 3, 2014 and April 14, 2014, in which the Company amended previously disclosed sales
(sales originally stated at $1,275,000 were restated to $1,082,375 - reduction of $192,625) and restated goodwill as $1,855,512
(previously reported at net zero). Additionally, the Complaint states after the filing of the Company s Current Report on
Form 8-K on April 3, 2014 and the following press release, the Company s stock price  fell $7.30 per share, or more
than 20%, to close at $25.30 per share.  Subsequent to the filing of the Complaint, six different individuals filed a motion
asking to be designated the lead plaintiff in the litigation.  On March 19, 2015, the Court issued a ruling appointing Steve
Schuck as lead plaintiff.  Counsel for Mr. Schuck filed a  consolidated amended complaint  on September 14, 2015.
On December 11, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.  After requesting several
extensions, counsel for Mr. Schuck filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on March 21, 2016.  The Company s reply
brief was filed on April 25, 2016.  Defendant Stuart Titus was served with the Summons   Complaint in the case and he
has recently completed briefing his motion to dismiss, through separate counsel. No hearing date has been set by the Court at this
time with respect to the motions to dismiss.  Management intends to vigorously defend the allegations and an estimate of possible
loss cannot be made at this time. 

On March 17, 2015, stockholder
Michael Ruth filed a shareholder derivative suit in Nevada District Court alleging two causes of action: 1) Breach of Fiduciary
Duty, and 2)  Gross Mismanagement.  The claims are premised on the same event as the already-pending securities class
action case in New York discussed above   it is alleged that the Form 8-K filings misstated goodwill and sales of the Company,
which when corrected, lead to a significant drop in stock price. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the suit on June 29, 2015. 
Instead of opposing the Company s motion, Mr. Ruth filed an amended complaint on July 20, 2015.  Thereafter, Mr. Ruth
and the Company agreed to stay the action pending the outcome of the securities class action case in New York discussed above. 
Management intends to vigorously defend the allegations.  Since no discovery has been conducted and the case remains stayed,
an estimate of the possible loss or recovery cannot be made at this time.

relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates (including all trade secrets) in whatever form, whether oral, written, or electronic
(collectively, the  Confidential Information ), to which Executive has, or is given (or has had or been given), access
during the course of his employment with the Company. It is agreed that the Confidential Information is confidential and proprietary
to the Company because such Confidential Information encompasses technical know-how, trade secrets, or technical, financial, organizational,

legal process, or any order or mandate of a court or other governmental authority to be disclosed, or (c) is reasonably believed
by Executive, based upon the advice of legal counsel, to be required to be disclosed in defense of a lawsuit or other legal or
administrative action brought against Executive;  provided, however,  that in the case of clause (b) or (c), Executive shall

opportunity related to the business of the Company, Executive shall promptly notify the Board of Directors of such opportunity.
Executive shall not appropriate for himself or for any other Person other than the Company (or any Affiliate) any such opportunity
unless, as to any particular opportunity, the Board of Directors fails to take appropriate action within thirty (30) days. Executive's
duty to notify the Board of Directors and to refrain from appropriating all such opportunities for thirty (30) days shall neither
be limited by, nor shall such duty limit, the application of the general laws relating to the fiduciary duties of an agent or employee. 

7.2               
  Failure to Notify . In the event that Executive fails to notify the Board of Directors or so appropriates any such

 The capacity in which Executive shall have acquired such opportunity; or 

(b)               
 The probable success in the hands of the Company of such opportunity. 

8.         No
Prior Agreements . Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that the execution of this Agreement by Executive,
his employment by the Company, and the performance of his duties hereunder will not violate or be a breach of any agreement with
a former employer or any other Person. Further, Executive agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its officers, directors
and representatives for any claim, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation, of
any such third party that such third party may now have or may hereafter come to have against the Company or such other persons,
based upon or arising out of any non-competition agreement, invention, secrecy or other agreement between Executive and such third
party that was in existence as of the effective date of this Agreement. To the extent that Executive had any oral or written employment
agreement or understanding with the Company, this Agreement shall automatically supersede such agreement or understanding, and
upon execution of this Agreement by Executive and the Company, such prior agreement or understanding automatically shall be deemed
to have been terminated and shall be null and void. 

9.         Representation .
Executive acknowledges that he (a) has reviewed this Agreement in its entirety, (b) has had an opportunity to obtain the advice
of separate legal counsel prior to executing this Agreement, and (c) fully understands all provisions of this Agreement. 

10.         Assignment:
Binding Effect . Executive understands that he has been selected for employment by the Company on the basis of his personal
qualifications, experience and skills. Executive agrees, therefore, that he cannot assign or delegate all or any portion of his
performance under this Agreement. This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by the Company without the prior written consent
of Executive. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Executive accepts employment with an Affiliate, unless Executive and his new employer agree otherwise in writing, this Agreement
shall automatically be deemed to have been assigned to such new employer (which shall thereafter be an additional or substitute
beneficiary of the covenants contained herein, as appropriate), with the consent of Executive, such assignment shall be considered
a condition of employment by such new employer, and references to the  Company  in this Agreement shall be deemed to
refer to such new employer. 

11.
        Complete Agreement; Waiver: Amendment . Executive has no oral representations,
understandings or agreements with the Company or any of its officers, directors or representatives covering the same subject matter
as this Agreement. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive statement and expression of the agreement between the Company
and   Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and cannot be varied,
contradicted, or supplemented by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements. This Agreement may not be
later modified except by a further writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and Executive, and no term of this
Agreement may be waived except by writing signed by the party waiving the benefit of such term.  

12.         Notices. 
All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be given or made by personally delivering the same to or sending the same by prepaid certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, or by reputable overnight courier, or by facsimile machine to the party to which it is directed at the address
set out on the signature page to this Agreement, with copies to counsel as indicated, or at such other address as such party shall
have specified by written notice to the other party as provided in this Section, and shall be deemed to be given if delivered personally
at the time of delivery, or if sent by certified or registered mail as herein provided three (3) days after the same shall have
been posted, or if sent by reputable overnight courier upon receipt, or if sent by facsimile machine as soon as the sender receives
written or telephonic confirmation that the facsimile was received by the recipient and such facsimile is followed the same day
by mailing by prepaid first class mail. 

13.         Severability:
Headings . If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or inoperative, the other portions of this Agreement shall be deemed
valid and operative and, so far as is reasonable and possible, effect shall be given to the intent manifested by the portion held
invalid and inoperative. This severability provision shall be in addition to, and not in place of, the provisions of  Section
5.3  above. The Sections headings herein are for reference purposes only and are not intended in any way to describe, interpret,
define or limit the extent or intent of this Agreement or of any part hereof. 

14.
  Equitable Remedy . Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to the Company as a result of a breach of
the restrictive covenants set forth in  Sections 5  and  6   hereof, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage
that would be caused to the Company for which monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy, it is hereby agreed that in addition

to be employed by the Company and enter into a business or pursue other activities that, at such time, are not in competition with
the Company or any of its Affiliates, Executive shall not be chargeable with a violation of this  Section 5  if the Company
subsequently enters the same (or a similar) competitive business or activity. In addition, if Executive has no actual knowledge
that his actions violate the terms of this  Section 5 , Executive shall not be deemed to have breached the restrictive covenants
contained herein if, promptly after being notified by the Company of such breach, Executive ceases the prohibited actions. 

5.3              
  Severability . The covenants in this  Section 5  are severable and separate, and the unenforceability of any
specific covenant shall not affect the provisions of any other covenant. If any provision of this  Section 5  relating to
the time period or geographic area of the restrictive covenants shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed
the maximum time period or geographic area, as applicable, that such court deems reasonable and enforceable, such time period or
geographic area shall be deemed to be, and thereafter shall become, the maximum time period or largest geographic area that such
court deems reasonable and enforceable and this Agreement shall automatically be considered to have been amended and revised to
reflect such determination. 

5.4              
  Fair and Reasonable . Executive has carefully read and considered the provisions of this  Section 5  and, having
done so, agrees that the restrictive covenants in this  Section 5  impose a fair and reasonable restraint on Executive and
are reasonably required to protect the interests of the Company, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees
and stockholders. It is further agreed that the Company and Executive intend that such covenants be construed and enforced in accordance
with the changing activities, business and locations of the Company throughout the term of these covenants. 

6.         Confidential
Information . 

6.1               
  Confidential Information . Executive hereby agrees to hold in strict confidence and not to disclose to any third party,
other than employees and agents of the Company or persons retained by the Company to represent its interests, any of the valuable,
confidential and proprietary business, financial, technical, economic, sales and/or other types of proprietary business information
relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates (including all trade secrets) in whatever form, whether oral, written, or electronic
(collectively, the  Confidential Information ), to which Executive has, or is given (or has had or been given), access
during the course of his employment with the Company. It is agreed that the Confidential Information is confidential and proprietary
to the Company because such Confidential Information encompasses technical know-how, trade secrets, or technical, financial, organizational,
sales or other valuable aspects of the business and trade of the Company or its Affiliates, including without limitation, technologies,
products, processes, plans, clients, personnel, operations and business activities. This restriction shall not apply to any Confidential
Information that (a) becomes known generally to the public through no fault of the Executive, (b) is required by applicable law,
legal process, or any order or mandate of a court or other governmental authority to be disclosed, or (c) is reasonably believed
by Executive, based upon the advice of legal counsel, to be required to be disclosed in defense of a lawsuit or other legal or
administrative action brought against Executive;  provided, however,  that in the case of clause (b) or (c), Executive shall
give the Company reasonable advance written notice of the Confidential Information intended to be disclosed and the reasons and
circumstances surrounding such disclosure, in order to permit the Company to seek a protective order or other appropriate request
for confidential treatment of the applicable Confidential Information. 

6.2               
  Return of Company Property . In the event of termination of Executive's employment with the Company for whatever reason
or no reason, (a) Executive agrees not to copy, make known, disclose or use, any of the Confidential Information without the Company's
prior written consent, and (b) Executive or Executive's personal representative shall return to the Company (i) all Confidential
Information, (ii) all other records, designs, patents, business plans, financial statements, manuals, memoranda, lists, correspondence,
reports, records, charts, advertising materials and other data or property delivered to or compiled by Executive by or on behalf
of the Company or its respective representatives, vendors or customers that pertain to the business of the Company or any of its
Affiliates, whether in paper, electronic or other form, and (iii) all keys, credit cards, vehicles and other property of the Company.
Executive shall not retain or cause to be retained any copies of the foregoing. Executive hereby agrees that all of the foregoing
shall be and remain the property of the Company and the applicable Affiliates and be subject at all times to their discretion and
control. 

7.         Corporate
Opportunities . 

7.1               
  Duty to Notify.  During the Term of this Agreement, in the event that Executive shall become aware of any business
opportunity related to the business of the Company, Executive shall promptly notify the Board of Directors of such opportunity.
Executive shall not appropriate for himself or for any other Person other than the Company (or any Affiliate) any such opportunity
unless, as to any particular opportunity, the Board of Directors fails to take appropriate action within thirty (30) days. Executive's
duty to notify the Board of Directors and to refrain from appropriating all such opportunities for thirty (30) days shall neither
be limited by, nor shall such duty limit, the application of the general laws relating to the fiduciary duties of an agent or employee. 

7.2               
  Failure to Notify . In the event that Executive fails to notify the Board of Directors or so appropriates any such
opportunity without the express written consent of the Board of Directors, Executive shall be deemed to have violated the provisions
of this Section notwithstanding the following: 

(a)                
 The capacity in which Executive shall have acquired such opportunity; or 

(b)               
 The probable success in the hands of the Company of such opportunity. 

8.         No
Prior Agreements . Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that the execution of this Agreement by Executive,
his employment by the Company, and the performance of his duties hereunder will not violate or be a breach of any agreement with
a former employer or any other Person. Further, Executive agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its officers, directors
and representatives for any claim, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation, of
any such third party that such third party may now have or may hereafter come to have against the Company or such other persons,
based upon or arising out of any non-competition agreement, invention, secrecy or other agreement between Executive and such third
party that was in existence as of the effective date of this Agreement. To the extent that Executive had any oral or written employment
agreement or understanding with the Company, this Agreement shall automatically supersede such agreement or understanding, and
upon execution of this Agreement by Executive and the Company, such prior agreement or understanding automatically shall be deemed
to have been terminated and shall be null and void. 

9.         Representation .
Executive acknowledges that he (a) has reviewed this Agreement in its entirety, (b) has had an opportunity to obtain the advice
of separate legal counsel prior to executing this Agreement, and (c) fully understands all provisions of this Agreement. 

10.         Assignment:
Binding Effect . Executive understands that he has been selected for employment by the Company on the basis of his personal
qualifications, experience and skills. Executive agrees, therefore, that he cannot assign or delegate all or any portion of his
performance under this Agreement. This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by the Company without the prior written consent
of Executive. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Executive accepts employment with an Affiliate, unless Executive and his new employer agree otherwise in writing, this Agreement
shall automatically be deemed to have been assigned to such new employer (which shall thereafter be an additional or substitute
beneficiary of the covenants contained herein, as appropriate), with the consent of Executive, such assignment shall be considered
a condition of employment by such new employer, and references to the  Company  in this Agreement shall be deemed to
refer to such new employer. 

11.
        Complete Agreement; Waiver: Amendment . Executive has no oral representations,
understandings or agreements with the Company or any of its officers, directors or representatives covering the same subject matter
as this Agreement. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive statement and expression of the agreement between the Company
and   Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and cannot be varied,
contradicted, or supplemented by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements. This Agreement may not be
later modified except by a further writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and Executive, and no term of this
Agreement may be waived except by writing signed by the party waiving the benefit of such term.  

12.         Notices. 
All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be given or made by personally delivering the same to or sending the same by prepaid certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, or by reputable overnight courier, or by facsimile machine to the party to which it is directed at the address
set out on the signature page to this Agreement, with copies to counsel as indicated, or at such other address as such party shall
have specified by written notice to the other party as provided in this Section, and shall be deemed to be given if delivered personally
at the time of delivery, or if sent by certified or registered mail as herein provided three (3) days after the same shall have
been posted, or if sent by reputable overnight courier upon receipt, or if sent by facsimile machine as soon as the sender receives
written or telephonic confirmation that the facsimile was received by the recipient and such facsimile is followed the same day
by mailing by prepaid first class mail. 

13.         Severability:
Headings . If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or inoperative, the other portions of this Agreement shall be deemed
valid and operative and, so far as is reasonable and possible, effect shall be given to the intent manifested by the portion held
invalid and inoperative. This severability provision shall be in addition to, and not in place of, the provisions of  Section
5.3  above. The Sections headings herein are for reference purposes only and are not intended in any way to describe, interpret,
define or limit the extent or intent of this Agreement or of any part hereof. 

14.
  Equitable Remedy . Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to the Company as a result of a breach of
the restrictive covenants set forth in  Sections 5  and  6   hereof, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage
that would be caused to the Company for which monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy, it is hereby agreed that in addition
to all other remedies that may be available to the Company or Executive at law or in equity, the Company or Executive shall be
entitled to specific performance and any injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any breach or threatened breach
of the aforementioned restrictive covenants.  

15.         Arbitration. 
Any unresolved dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration
conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The arbitrators shall not have the
authority to add to, detract from, or modify any provision hereof nor to award punitive damages to any injured party. A decision
by a majority of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrators' award in any court
having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief,
as contemplated by  Section 14  hereof, from any court of competent jurisdiction, without the need to resort to arbitration.
Should judicial proceedings be commenced to enforce or carry out this provision or any arbitration award, the prevailing party
in such proceedings shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in addition to other relief. 

16.         Governing
Law . This Agreement shall in all respects be construed according to the laws of the State of California, without regard to
its conflict of flaws principles. 

17.         Counterparts .
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which may be executed by less than all of the parties to
this Agreement, each of which shall be enforceable against the parties actually executing such counterparts, and all of which together
shall constitute one instrument. 

18.         Signatures .
The parties shall be entitled to rely upon and enforce a facsimile of any authorized signatures as if it were the original.

 Any other material breach by the Company of this Agreement which is not cured within twenty (20) days of delivery of written

 6  hereof shall survive such termination in accordance with their respective terms. 

(b)               
 In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any agreement with respect thereto, (i) upon
termination of Executive's employment pursuant to  Sections 4.3  or  4.5  (termination with Cause or voluntary termination
without Good Reason) all Stock Options, other equity options, restricted equity grants and similar rights held by Executive with
respect to securities of the Company, shall stock opt to the extent not then fully vested, immediately terminate and revert to
the Company, (ii) upon termination of Executive's employment pursuant to  Section 4.4  or  Section 4.6  (termination

be affected by such termination, and shall continue to vest based upon the organizational performance goals set forth in  Exhibit
B , and (iii) upon termination of Executive's employment pursuant to  Section 4.1  or  Section 4.2  (Executive s
death or Disability), all Stock Options, other equity options, restricted equity grants and similar rights held by Executive with
respect to securities of the Company shall, to the extent not then fully vested, immediately become fully vested. 

4.8               
  No Termination by Merger; Transfer of Assets or Dissolution . This Agreement shall not be terminated by any dissolution
of the Company resulting from either merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the consolidated or surviving corporation
or other entity or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. In such event, the rights, benefits and obligations
herein shall automatically be deemed to be assigned to the surviving or resulting corporation or other entity or to the transferee
of the assets, as the case may be, with the consent of Executive. 

4.9               
   Non-Disparagement . During the Term and at all times thereafter, Executive agrees not to make or solicit or
encourage others to make or solicit directly or indirectly any disparaging, derogatory or negative statement or communication,
oral or written, about the Company or its business practices, programs, products, services, operations, policies, activities, current
or former officers, directors, managerial personnel, or other employees, or its customers to any other person or entity;  provided,
however , that such restriction shall not prohibit truthful testimony compelled by valid legal process or to the extent made
in connection with filing or asserting any claims relating to employment. The Company agrees not to make any disparaging, derogatory
or negative statement or communication, oral or written, about Executive;  provided, however , that such restriction shall
not prohibit truthful testimony compelled by valid legal process. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
 Section 4.11  shall prevent any party to this Agreement from exercising its or his authority or enforcing its or his rights
or remedies hereunder or that such party may otherwise be entitled to enforce or assert under another agreement or applicable law,
or limit such rights or remedies in any way. 

5.         Restriction
on Competition.  

5.1              
  Covenant Not to Compete . During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months from the termination
of this Agreement, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly, for himself
or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other Person if such activities would necessarily involve the disclosure or use of any
of the Company s trade secrets, confidential or other proprietary information (i) own, manage, operate, control, be employed
by, participate in, render services to, or be associated in any manner with the ownership, management, operation or control of,
any business similar to the type of business conducted by the Company or any of its Affiliates within any of the geographic territories
in which the Company or any of its Affiliates conducts business, (ii) solicit business of the same or similar type being carried
on by the Company or any of its Affiliates from any Person known by Executive to be a customer of the Company or any of its Affiliates,
whether or not Executive had personal contact with such Person during and by reason of Executive's employment with the Company,
or (iii) endeavor or attempt in any way to interfere with or induce a breach of any contractual relationship that the Company or
any of its Affiliates may have with any employee, customer, contractor, supplier, representative or distributor. 

5.2              
  No Breach for Activities Deemed Not Competitive . It is further agreed that, in the event that Executive shall cease
to be employed by the Company and enter into a business or pursue other activities that, at such time, are not in competition with
the Company or any of its Affiliates, Executive shall not be chargeable with a violation of this  Section 5  if the Company
subsequently enters the same (or a similar) competitive business or activity. In addition, if Executive has no actual knowledge
that his actions violate the terms of this  Section 5 , Executive shall not be deemed to have breached the restrictive covenants
contained herein if, promptly after being notified by the Company of such breach, Executive ceases the prohibited actions. 

5.3              
  Severability . The covenants in this  Section 5  are severable and separate, and the unenforceability of any
specific covenant shall not affect the provisions of any other covenant. If any provision of this  Section 5  relating to
the time period or geographic area of the restrictive covenants shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed
the maximum time period or geographic area, as applicable, that such court deems reasonable and enforceable, such time period or
geographic area shall be deemed to be, and thereafter shall become, the maximum time period or largest geographic area that such
court deems reasonable and enforceable and this Agreement shall automatically be considered to have been amended and revised to
reflect such determination. 

5.4              
  Fair and Reasonable . Executive has carefully read and considered the provisions of this  Section 5  and, having
done so, agrees that the restrictive covenants in this  Section 5  impose a fair and reasonable restraint on Executive and
are reasonably required to protect the interests of the Company, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees
and stockholders. It is further agreed that the Company and Executive intend that such covenants be construed and enforced in accordance
with the changing activities, business and locations of the Company throughout the term of these covenants. 

6.         Confidential
Information . 

6.1               
  Confidential Information . Executive hereby agrees to hold in strict confidence and not to disclose to any third party,
other than employees and agents of the Company or persons retained by the Company to represent its interests, any of the valuable,
confidential and proprietary business, financial, technical, economic, sales and/or other types of proprietary business information
relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates (including all trade secrets) in whatever form, whether oral, written, or electronic
(collectively, the  Confidential Information ), to which Executive has, or is given (or has had or been given), access
during the course of his employment with the Company. It is agreed that the Confidential Information is confidential and proprietary
to the Company because such Confidential Information encompasses technical know-how, trade secrets, or technical, financial, organizational,
sales or other valuable aspects of the business and trade of the Company or its Affiliates, including without limitation, technologies,
products, processes, plans, clients, personnel, operations and business activities. This restriction shall not apply to any Confidential
Information that (a) becomes known generally to the public through no fault of the Executive, (b) is required by applicable law,
legal process, or any order or mandate of a court or other governmental authority to be disclosed, or (c) is reasonably believed
by Executive, based upon the advice of legal counsel, to be required to be disclosed in defense of a lawsuit or other legal or
administrative action brought against Executive;  provided, however,  that in the case of clause (b) or (c), Executive shall
give the Company reasonable advance written notice of the Confidential Information intended to be disclosed and the reasons and
circumstances surrounding such disclosure, in order to permit the Company to seek a protective order or other appropriate request
for confidential treatment of the applicable Confidential Information. 

6.2               
  Return of Company Property . In the event of termination of Executive's employment with the Company for whatever reason
or no reason, (a) Executive agrees not to copy, make known, disclose or use, any of the Confidential Information without the Company's
prior written consent, and (b) Executive or Executive's personal representative shall return to the Company (i) all Confidential
Information, (ii) all other records, designs, patents, business plans, financial statements, manuals, memoranda, lists, correspondence,
reports, records, charts, advertising materials and other data or property delivered to or compiled by Executive by or on behalf
of the Company or its respective representatives, vendors or customers that pertain to the business of the Company or any of its
Affiliates, whether in paper, electronic or other form, and (iii) all keys, credit cards, vehicles and other property of the Company.
Executive shall not retain or cause to be retained any copies of the foregoing. Executive hereby agrees that all of the foregoing
shall be and remain the property of the Company and the applicable Affiliates and be subject at all times to their discretion and
control. 

7.         Corporate
Opportunities . 

7.1               
  Duty to Notify.  During the Term of this Agreement, in the event that Executive shall become aware of any business
opportunity related to the business of the Company, Executive shall promptly notify the Board of Directors of such opportunity.
Executive shall not appropriate for himself or for any other Person other than the Company (or any Affiliate) any such opportunity
unless, as to any particular opportunity, the Board of Directors fails to take appropriate action within thirty (30) days. Executive's
duty to notify the Board of Directors and to refrain from appropriating all such opportunities for thirty (30) days shall neither
be limited by, nor shall such duty limit, the application of the general laws relating to the fiduciary duties of an agent or employee. 

7.2               
  Failure to Notify . In the event that Executive fails to notify the Board of Directors or so appropriates any such
opportunity without the express written consent of the Board of Directors, Executive shall be deemed to have violated the provisions
of this Section notwithstanding the following: 

(a)                
 The capacity in which Executive shall have acquired such opportunity; or 

(b)               
 The probable success in the hands of the Company of such opportunity. 

8.         No
Prior Agreements . Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that the execution of this Agreement by Executive,
his employment by the Company, and the performance of his duties hereunder will not violate or be a breach of any agreement with
a former employer or any other Person. Further, Executive agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its officers, directors
and representatives for any claim, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation, of
any such third party that such third party may now have or may hereafter come to have against the Company or such other persons,
based upon or arising out of any non-competition agreement, invention, secrecy or other agreement between Executive and such third
party that was in existence as of the effective date of this Agreement. To the extent that Executive had any oral or written employment
agreement or understanding with the Company, this Agreement shall automatically supersede such agreement or understanding, and
upon execution of this Agreement by Executive and the Company, such prior agreement or understanding automatically shall be deemed
to have been terminated and shall be null and void. 

9.         Representation .
Executive acknowledges that he (a) has reviewed this Agreement in its entirety, (b) has had an opportunity to obtain the advice
of separate legal counsel prior to executing this Agreement, and (c) fully understands all provisions of this Agreement. 

10.         Assignment:
Binding Effect . Executive understands that he has been selected for employment by the Company on the basis of his personal
qualifications, experience and skills. Executive agrees, therefore, that he cannot assign or delegate all or any portion of his
performance under this Agreement. This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by the Company without the prior written consent
of Executive. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Executive accepts employment with an Affiliate, unless Executive and his new employer agree otherwise in writing, this Agreement
shall automatically be deemed to have been assigned to such new employer (which shall thereafter be an additional or substitute
beneficiary of the covenants contained herein, as appropriate), with the consent of Executive, such assignment shall be considered
a condition of employment by such new employer, and references to the  Company  in this Agreement shall be deemed to
refer to such new employer. 

11.
        Complete Agreement; Waiver: Amendment . Executive has no oral representations,
understandings or agreements with the Company or any of its officers, directors or representatives covering the same subject matter
as this Agreement. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive statement and expression of the agreement between the Company
and   Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and cannot be varied,
contradicted, or supplemented by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements. This Agreement may not be
later modified except by a further writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and Executive, and no term of this
Agreement may be waived except by writing signed by the party waiving the benefit of such term.  

12.         Notices. 
All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be given or made by personally delivering the same to or sending the same by prepaid certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, or by reputable overnight courier, or by facsimile machine to the party to which it is directed at the address
set out on the signature page to this Agreement, with copies to counsel as indicated, or at such other address as such party shall
have specified by written notice to the other party as provided in this Section, and shall be deemed to be given if delivered personally
at the time of delivery, or if sent by certified or registered mail as herein provided three (3) days after the same shall have
been posted, or if sent by reputable overnight courier upon receipt, or if sent by facsimile machine as soon as the sender receives
written or telephonic confirmation that the facsimile was received by the recipient and such facsimile is followed the same day
by mailing by prepaid first class mail. 

13.         Severability:
Headings . If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or inoperative, the other portions of this Agreement shall be deemed
valid and operative and, so far as is reasonable and possible, effect shall be given to the intent manifested by the portion held
invalid and inoperative. This severability provision shall be in addition to, and not in place of, the provisions of  Section
5.3  above. The Sections headings herein are for reference purposes only and are not intended in any way to describe, interpret,
define or limit the extent or intent of this Agreement or of any part hereof. 

14.
  Equitable Remedy . Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to the Company as a result of a breach of the
restrictive covenants set forth in  Sections 5  and  6   hereof, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage
that would be caused to the Company for which monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy, it is hereby agreed that in addition
to all other remedies that may be available to the Company or Executive at law or in equity, the Company or Executive shall be
entitled to specific performance and any injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any breach or threatened breach of
the aforementioned restrictive covenants.        

15.         Arbitration. 
Any unresolved dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration
conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The arbitrators shall not have the
authority to add to, detract from, or modify any provision hereof nor to award punitive damages to any injured party. A decision
by a majority of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrators' award in any court
having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief,
as contemplated by  Section 14  hereof, from any court of competent jurisdiction, without the need to resort to arbitration.
Should judicial proceedings be commenced to enforce or carry out this provision or any arbitration award, the prevailing party
in such proceedings shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in addition to other relief. 

16.         Governing
Law . This Agreement shall in all respects be construed according to the laws of the State of California, without regard to
its conflict of flaws principles. 

17.         Counterparts .
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which may be executed by less than all of the parties to
this Agreement, each of which shall be enforceable against the parties actually executing such counterparts, and all of which together
shall constitute one instrument. 

18.         Signatures .
The parties shall be entitled to rely upon and enforce a facsimile of any authorized signatures as if it were the original.

Exhibit 10.4 

CV SCIENCES,
INC.   

  NON-QUALIFIED
STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT   

This
NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this  Agreement ) is made and entered into as of July 6, 2016, by and between CV
Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ) and Michael Mona, Jr. ( Optionee ). 

RECITALS 

A.     
       The Company granted options to Optionee pursuant to the resolutions of the Board of Directors
dated July 6, 2016 ( Grant Date ) to provide an incentive to Optionee to focus on the long-term growth of the Company. 

B.        
    The parties wish to memorialize the grant and in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set
forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows: 

AGREEMENT 

1.          
   Grant of Option .  The Company hereby grants to Optionee the right and option (the  Option )
to purchase an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company (the  Stock ) (such number being subject
to adjustment as set forth herein) on the terms and conditions herein set forth. This Option may be exercised in whole
or in part and from time to time as hereinafter provided.  The Option granted under this Agreement is not intended to
be an  incentive stock option  as set forth in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). 

2.         
    Vesting of Option .   

(a)          
 Subject to the provisions set forth in this Agreement, the Option shall vest and become exercisable in accordance with the
following schedule: 

(i)                 
 the first time the Company completes development of a U.S. Food   Drug Administration ( FDA ) current good
manufacturing practice grade batch of successfully synthetically formulated CBD for use in drug development activities (25% vesting
of the Option); and 

(ii)               
 the first time the Company files an investigational new drug application with the FDA in connection with a development program
utilizing CBD as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (a  CBD Drug Product ) (25% vesting of the Option); 

(iii)             
 the first time the Company commences a Phase I clinical trial as authorized by the FDA for a CBD Drug Product (25% vesting
of the Option); and 

(iv)              
 the first time the Company commences a Phase II clinical trial as authorized by the FDA for a CBD Drug Product (25% vesting
of the Option). 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, vesting shall accelerate upon a Disposition Event as defined under the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated
December 30, 2015 by and among CannaVest Corp., CannaVest Merger Sub, Inc. CannaVest Acquisition LLC, CanX, Inc. and The Starwood
Trust, as Shareholder Representative. 

(b)                
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to exercise the Option shall accelerate automatically and vest in full (notwithstanding
the provisions above) effective as of immediately prior to the consummation of the  Change in Control  (as defined
below) unless this Option is to be assumed by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent thereof) or a new option or New Incentives
(as defined below) are to be issued in exchange therefor, as provided in subsection (c) below. 

(c)                
 The vesting of the Option shall not accelerate if and to the extent that: (i) the Option (including the unvested portion
thereof) is to be assumed by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent thereof) or a new option of comparable value is to be
issued in exchange therefor pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction, or (ii) the Option (including the unvested
portion thereof) is to be replaced by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent thereof) with other incentives of comparable
value under a new incentive program ( New Incentives ) containing such terms and provisions as the Company s
Board of Directors in its discretion may consider equitable. If the Option is assumed, or if a new option of comparable value is
issued in exchange therefor, then the Option or the new option shall be appropriately adjusted, concurrently with the Change in
Control, to apply to the number and class of securities or other property that the Optionee would have received pursuant to the
Change in Control transaction in exchange for the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option had the Option been exercised immediately
prior to the Change in Control, and appropriate adjustment also shall be made to the Purchase Price such that the aggregate Purchase
Price of this Option or the new option shall remain the same as nearly as practicable. 

(d)

In connection with the purchase of the
above-listed Securities, the undersigned Optionee represents to the Company the following: 

Optionee is aware of the Company's business
affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable
decision to acquire the Securities. Optionee is acquiring these Securities for investment for Optionee's own account only and not
with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any  distribution  thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). 

Optionee acknowledges and understands that
the Securities constitute  restricted securities  under the Securities Act and have not been registered under the Securities
Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon among other things, the bona fide nature of Optionee's
investment intent as expressed herein. Optionee further understands that the Securities must be held indefinitely unless they are
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Optionee further acknowledges
and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Securities. Optionee understands that the certificate evidencing
the Securities will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the Securities unless they are registered or such
registration is not required in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company. 

Optionee further understands that in the
event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance with
Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive,
the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement
securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof
in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective
brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk. Optionee understands that no assurances can be given that
any such other registration exemption will be available in such event. 

Optionee represents that he is a resident
of the state of _________________.

INC.   

  NON-QUALIFIED

This
NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this  Agreement ) is made and entered into as of July 6, 2016, by and between CV
Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ) and Joseph Dowling ( Optionee ). 

RECITALS 

A.     
       The Company granted options to Optionee pursuant to the resolutions of the Board of Directors
dated July 6, 2016 ( Grant Date ) to provide an incentive to Optionee to focus on the long-term growth of the Company. 

B.        
    The parties wish to memorialize the grant and in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set
forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows: 

AGREEMENT 

1.          
   Grant of Option .  The Company hereby grants to Optionee the right and option (the  Option )
to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company (the  Stock ) (such number being subject
to adjustment as set forth herein) on the terms and conditions herein set forth. This Option may be exercised in whole
or in part and from time to time as hereinafter provided.  The Option granted under this Agreement is not intended to
be an  incentive stock option  as set forth in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). 

2.         
    Vesting of Option .   

(a)          
 Subject to the provisions set forth in this Agreement, the Option shall vest and become exercisable in accordance with the
following schedule: 

(i)                 
 the first time the Company completes development of a U.S. Food   Drug Administration ( FDA ) current good
manufacturing practice grade batch of successfully synthetically formulated CBD for use in drug development activities (25% vesting
of the Option); and 

(ii)               
 the first time the Company files an investigational new drug application with the FDA in connection with a development program
utilizing CBD as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (a  CBD Drug Product ) (25% vesting of the Option); 

(iii)             
 the first time the Company commences a Phase I clinical trial as authorized by the FDA for a CBD Drug Product (25% vesting
of the Option); and 

(iv)              
 the first time the Company commences a Phase II clinical trial as authorized by the FDA for a CBD Drug Product (25% vesting
of the Option). 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, vesting shall accelerate upon a Disposition Event as defined under the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated
December 30, 2015 by and among CannaVest Corp., CannaVest Merger Sub, Inc. CannaVest Acquisition LLC, CanX, Inc. and The Starwood
Trust, as Shareholder Representative. 

(b)                
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to exercise the Option shall accelerate automatically and vest in full (notwithstanding
the provisions above) effective as of immediately prior to the consummation of the  Change in Control  (as defined
below) unless this Option is to be assumed by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent thereof) or a new option or New Incentives
(as defined below) are to be issued in exchange therefor, as provided in subsection (c) below. 

p 

 (c)                
 The vesting of the Option shall not accelerate if and to the extent that: (i) the Option (including the unvested portion
thereof) is to be assumed by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent thereof) or a new option of comparable value is to be
issued in exchange therefor pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction, or (ii) the Option (including the unvested
portion thereof) is to be replaced by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent thereof) with other incentives of comparable
value under a new incentive program ( New Incentives ) containing such terms and provisions as the Company s
Board of Directors in its discretion may consider equitable. If the Option is assumed, or if a new option of comparable value is
issued in exchange therefor, then the Option or the new option shall be appropriately adjusted, concurrently with the Change in
Control, to apply to the number and class of securities or other property that the Optionee would have received pursuant to the
Change in Control transaction in exchange for the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option had the Option been exercised immediately
prior to the Change in Control, and appropriate adjustment also shall be made to the Purchase Price such that the aggregate Purchase
Price of this Option or the new option shall remain the same as nearly as practicable. 

(d)                
 If the provisions of subsection (c) above apply, then the Option, the new option or the New Incentives shall continue to
vest as provided above for the remainder of the term of the Option in accordance with the terms hereof. However, in the event of
an Involuntary Termination (as defined below) of Optionee s service with the Company or the acquiring or successor entity
(or parent thereof) within twelve (12) months following such Change in Control, then vesting of this Option, the new option or
the New Incentives shall accelerate in full automatically effective upon such Involuntary Termination. 

(e)                
  Involuntary Termination  shall mean a termination of service by reason of: (i) Optionee s involuntary
dismissal or discharge by the Company, or by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent or any subsidiary thereof employing the
Optionee) for reasons other than Misconduct (as defined below), or (ii) Optionee s voluntary resignation following (x)
a reduction in Optionee s compensation by more than ten percent (10%), or (y) a relocation of Optionee s principal
place of employment by more than fifty (50) miles, provided and only if such change, reduction or relocation is effected without
Optionee s written consent. 

(f)                 
  Misconduct  shall mean (i) the commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement or dishonesty by Optionee which
affects the business of the Company, the acquiring or successor entity (or parent or any subsidiary thereof), (ii) any unauthorized
use or disclosure by Optionee of confidential information or trade secrets of the Company, the acquiring or successor entity (or

intent of this agreement. 

Entire Agreement. The Option Agreement
is incorporated herein by reference and together with this Exercise Notice constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and

In connection with the purchase of the
above-listed Securities, the undersigned Optionee represents to the Company the following: 

Optionee is aware of the Company's business
affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable
decision to acquire the Securities. Optionee is acquiring these Securities for investment for Optionee's own account only and not
with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any  distribution  thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). 

Optionee acknowledges and understands that
the Securities constitute  restricted securities  under the Securities Act and have not been registered under the Securities
Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon among other things, the bona fide nature of Optionee's
investment intent as expressed herein. Optionee further understands that the Securities must be held indefinitely unless they are
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Optionee further acknowledges
and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Securities. Optionee understands that the certificate evidencing
the Securities will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the Securities unless they are registered or such
registration is not required in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company. 

Optionee further understands that in the
event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance with
Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive,
the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement
securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof
in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective
brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk. Optionee understands that no assurances can be given that
any such other registration exemption will be available in such event. 

Optionee represents that he is a resident
of the state of _________________.

Exhibit 10.6 

CV SCIENCES,
INC.   

  NON-QUALIFIED
STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT   

This
NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this  Agreement ) is made and entered into as of July 6, 2016, by and between CV
Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ) and Michael Mona III ( Optionee ). 

RECITALS 

A.     
       The Company granted options to Optionee pursuant to the resolutions of the Board of Directors
dated July 6, 2016 ( Grant Date ) to provide an incentive to Optionee to focus on the long-term growth of the Company. 

B.        
    The parties wish to memorialize the grant and in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set
forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows: 

AGREEMENT 

1.          
   Grant of Option .  The Company hereby grants to Optionee the right and option (the  Option )
to purchase an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company (the  Stock ) (such number being subject
to adjustment as set forth herein) on the terms and conditions herein set forth. This Option may be exercised in whole
or in part and from time to time as hereinafter provided.  The Option granted under this Agreement is not intended to
be an  incentive stock option  as set forth in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). 

2.         
    Vesting of Option .   

(a)          
 Subject to the provisions set forth in this Agreement, the Option shall vest and become exercisable in accordance with the
following schedule: 

(i)                 
 the first time the Company completes development of a U.S. Food   Drug Administration ( FDA ) current good
manufacturing practice grade batch of successfully synthetically formulated CBD for use in drug development activities (25% vesting
of the Option); and 

(ii)               
 the first time the Company files an investigational new drug application with the FDA in connection with a development program
utilizing CBD as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (a  CBD Drug Product ) (25% vesting of the Option); 

(iii)             
 the first time the Company commences a Phase I clinical trial as authorized by the FDA for a CBD Drug Product (25% vesting
of the Option); and 

(iv)              
 the first time the Company commences a Phase II clinical trial as authorized by the FDA for a CBD Drug Product (25% vesting
of the Option). 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, vesting shall accelerate upon a Disposition Event as defined under the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated
December 30, 2015 by and among CannaVest Corp., CannaVest Merger Sub, Inc. CannaVest Acquisition LLC, CanX, Inc. and The Starwood
Trust, as Shareholder Representative. 

(b)                
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to exercise the Option shall accelerate automatically and vest in full (notwithstanding
the provisions above) effective as of immediately prior to the consummation of the  Change in Control  (as defined
below) unless this Option is to be assumed by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent thereof) or a new option or New Incentives
(as defined below) are to be issued in exchange therefor, as provided in subsection (c) below. 

(c)                
 The vesting of the Option shall not accelerate if and to the extent that: (i) the Option (including the unvested portion
thereof) is to be assumed by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent thereof) or a new option of comparable value is to be
issued in exchange therefor pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction, or (ii) the Option (including the unvested
portion thereof) is to be replaced by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent thereof) with other incentives of comparable
value under a new incentive program ( New Incentives ) containing such terms and provisions as the Company s
Board of Directors in its discretion may consider equitable. If the Option is assumed, or if a new option of comparable value is
issued in exchange therefor, then the Option or the new option shall be appropriately adjusted, concurrently with the Change in
Control, to apply to the number and class of securities or other property that the Optionee would have received pursuant to the
Change in Control transaction in exchange for the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option had the Option been exercised immediately
prior to the Change in Control, and appropriate adjustment also shall be made to the Purchase Price such that the aggregate Purchase
Price of this Option or the new option shall remain the same as nearly as practicable. 

(d)                
 If the provisions of subsection (c) above apply, then the Option, the new option or the New Incentives shall continue to
vest as provided above for the remainder of the term of the Option in accordance with the terms hereof. However, in the event of
an Involuntary Termination (as defined below) of Optionee s service with the Company or the acquiring or successor entity
(or parent thereof) within twelve (12) months following such Change in Control, then vesting of this Option, the new option or
the New Incentives shall accelerate in full automatically effective upon such Involuntary Termination. 

(e)                
  Involuntary Termination  shall mean a termination of service by reason of: (i) Optionee s involuntary
dismissal or discharge by the Company, or by the acquiring or successor entity (or parent or any subsidiary thereof employing the
Optionee) for reasons other than Misconduct (as defined below), or (ii) Optionee s voluntary resignation following (x)
a reduction in Optionee s compensation by more than ten percent (10%), or (y) a relocation of Optionee s principal
place of employment by more than fifty (50) miles, provided and only if such change, reduction or relocation is effected without
Optionee s written consent. 

(f)                 
  Misconduct  shall mean (i) the commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement or dishonesty by Optionee which
affects the business of the Company, the acquiring or successor entity (or parent or any subsidiary thereof), (ii) any unauthorized
use or disclosure by Optionee of confidential information or trade secrets of the Company, the acquiring or successor entity (or
parent or any subsidiary thereof), (iii) the refusal or omission by the Optionee to perform any duties required of him if such
duties are consistent with duties customary for the position held with the Company, the acquiring or successor entity (or parent
or any subsidiary thereof), (iv) any act or omission by the Optionee involving malfeasance or gross negligence in the performance
of Optionee s duties to, or material deviation from any of the policies or directives of, the Company or the acquiring or
successor entity (or parent or any subsidiary thereof), (v) conduct on the part of Optionee which constitutes the breach of any
statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company, the acquiring or successor entity (or parent or any subsidiary thereof),
or (vi) any illegal act by Optionee which materially and adversely affects the business of the Company, the acquiring or successor
entity (or parent or any subsidiary thereof), or any felony committed by Optionee, as evidenced by conviction thereof. The provisions
of this paragraph shall not limit the grounds for the dismissal or discharge of Optionee or any other individual in the service
of the Company, the acquiring or successor entity (or parent or any subsidiary thereof). 

(g)                 Change in Control  shall
mean: 

(i)                 
 The direct or indirect sale or transfer, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, by the stockholders
of the Company of voting securities, in which the holders of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior

 Attention: Secretary 

Effective as of today, ______________,
___ the undersigned (the  Optionee ) hereby elects to exercise the Optionee's option to purchase ___________ shares of
the Common Stock (the  Shares ) of CV Sciences, Inc. (the  Company ) under and pursuant to the Non-Qualified
Stock Option Award Agreement (the  Option Agreement ) dated July 6, 2016. 

Representations of the Optionee. The Optionee
acknowledges that the Optionee has received, read and understood the Option Agreement and agrees to abide by and be bound by their
terms and conditions. 

Rights as Stockholder. Until the stock
certificate evidencing such Shares is issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized
transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect
to the Shares, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate
promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior
to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in the Option Agreement. 

Delivery of Payment. The Optionee herewith
delivers to the Company the full Exercise Price for the Shares in the form(s) provided for in the Option Agreement, or, if approved,
the Shares shall be delivered pursuant to a net issuance. 

Tax Consultation. The Optionee understands
that the Optionee may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of the Optionee's purchase or disposition of the Shares. The
Optionee represents that the Optionee has consulted with any tax consultants the Optionee deems advisable in connection with the
purchase or disposition of the Shares and that the Optionee is not relying on the Company for any tax advice. 

Taxes. The Optionee agrees to satisfy all
applicable foreign, federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding obligations and herewith delivers to the Company
the full amount of such obligations or has made arrangements acceptable to the Company to satisfy such obligations. 

Restrictive Legends. The Optionee understands
and agrees that the Company shall cause the legends set forth below or legends substantially equivalent thereto, to be placed upon
any certificate(s) evidencing ownership of the Shares together with any other legends that may be required by the Company or by
state or federal securities laws: 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE
NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE  ACT ) AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED,
PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR, IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER OF THESE
SECURITIES, SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION IS IN COMPLIANCE THEREWITH.

assign any of its rights under this Exercise Notice to single or multiple assignees, and this agreement shall inure to the benefit
of the successors and assigns of the Company. Subject to the restrictions on transfer herein set forth, this Exercise Notice shall
be binding upon the Optionee and his or her heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. 

Headings. The captions used in this Exercise
Notice are inserted for convenience and shall not be deemed a part of this agreement for construction or interpretation. 

Interpretation. Any dispute regarding the
interpretation of this Exercise Notice shall be submitted by the Optionee or by the Company forthwith to the Board, which shall
review such dispute at its next regular meeting. The resolution of such a dispute by the Board shall be final and binding on all
persons. 

Governing Law; Severability. This Exercise
Notice is to be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State
of Delaware to the rights and duties of the parties. Should any provision of this Exercise Notice be determined by a court of law
to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions shall nevertheless remain effective and shall remain enforceable. 

Notices. Any notice required or permitted
hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon personal delivery or upon deposit in the United
States mail by certified mail, with postage and fees prepaid, addressed to the other party at its address as shown below beneath
its signature, or to such other address as such party may designate in writing from time to time to the other party. 

Further Instruments. The parties agree
to execute such further instruments and to take such further action as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and
intent of this agreement. 

Entire Agreement. The Option Agreement
is incorporated herein by reference and together with this Exercise Notice constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and
the Optionee with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the Optionee's interest except by
means of a writing signed by the Company and the Optionee.

In connection with the purchase of the
above-listed Securities, the undersigned Optionee represents to the Company the following: 

Optionee is aware of the Company's business
affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable
decision to acquire the Securities. Optionee is acquiring these Securities for investment for Optionee's own account only and not
with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any  distribution  thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). 

Optionee acknowledges and understands that
the Securities constitute  restricted securities  under the Securities Act and have not been registered under the Securities
Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon among other things, the bona fide nature of Optionee's
investment intent as expressed herein. Optionee further understands that the Securities must be held indefinitely unless they are
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Optionee further acknowledges
and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Securities. Optionee understands that the certificate evidencing
the Securities will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the Securities unless they are registered or such
registration is not required in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company. 

Optionee further understands that in the
event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance with
Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive,
the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement
securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof
in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective
brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk. Optionee understands that no assurances can be given that
any such other registration exemption will be available in such event. 

Optionee represents that he is a resident
of the state of _________________.
