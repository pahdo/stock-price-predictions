Note
1   ORGANIZATION   

DSG
Global, Inc. (formerly Boreal Productions Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 24, 2007.
We were formed to option feature films and TV projects to be packaged for sale to movie studios and production companies.  

Previously,
in anticipation of the share exchange agreement with DSG Tag Systems, Inc. ( DSG TAG ), we undertook to change our
name and effect a reverse stock split of our authorized and issued common stock. Accordingly, on January 19, 2015, our board of
directors approved an agreement and plan of merger to merge with our wholly-owned subsidiary DSG Global Inc., a Nevada corporation,
to effect a name change from Boreal Productions Inc. to DSG Global, Inc. Our company remains the surviving company. DSG Global,
Inc. was formed solely for the change of our name.  

Subsequent
to the closing of the share exchange agreement with DSG TAG, we have adopted the business and operations of DSG TAG.  

DSG
TAG was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 17, 2008 and extra provincially registered in British Columbia,
Canada in 2008. In March 2011, DSG TAG formed DSG Tag Systems International, Ltd. in the United Kingdom ( DSG UK ).
DSG UK is a wholly owned subsidiary of DSG TAG.  

Note
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States ( US GAAP ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to U.S. GAAP rules and regulations for presentation of interim financial information. Therefore,
the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and the notes thereto, included in the Company s Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Current
and future financial statements may not be directly comparable to the Company s historical financial statements. However,
except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In the opinion of Management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely
of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are
not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DSG Global Inc. and its subsidiary DSG Tag Systems, Inc. and its wholly
owned subsidiary DSG Tag Systems International, Ltd., collectively referred to as the Company. All material intercompany accounts,
transactions and profits were eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are
reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined.  

Exchange
(Loss) Gain   

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, the transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries were denominated
in foreign currencies and were recorded in Canadian dollar (CAD), or British Pounds (GBP), at the rates of exchange in effect
when the transactions occurred. Exchange gains and losses are recognized for the different foreign exchange rates applied when
the foreign currency assets and liabilities are settled.  

Foreign
Currency Translation and Comprehensive (Loss) Income   

The
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries were maintained, and its financial statements were expressed, in CAD and GBP. Such
financial statements were translated into United States dollars (USD) with the CAD or GBP as the functional currency. All assets
and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date, stockholders  deficit is translated at the
historical rates and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Transactions in foreign
currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of transaction. Any differences between the
initially recorded amount and the settlement amount are recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency transaction in the consolidated
statements of operations. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income as a component of
shareholders  equity.  

Reportable
Segment   

The
Company has one reportable segment. The Company s activities are interrelated and each activity is dependent upon and supportive
of the other. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based on analysis of financial products provided as a single
global business.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable,
and collectability is reasonably assured. In instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer, revenue
is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. The Company accrues for warranty costs, sales returns, and other allowances
based on its historical experience.  

Research
and Development   

Research
and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development.
Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate
software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to
software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached.
Research and development is expensed and is included in operating expenses.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income tax. Under the liability method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are provided based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities measured
by the current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which these differences are expected to reverse.  

The
Company has adopted accounting standards for the accounting for uncertain income taxes. These standards provide guidance for the
accounting and disclosure about uncertain tax positions taken. Management believes that all of the positions taken in its federal
and states income tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk   

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash, accounts receivable and other receivables
arising from its normal business activities. The Company places its cash in what it believes to be credit-worthy financial institutions.
The Company has a diversified customer base, most of which are in Canada, United States and the United Kingdom. The Company controls
credit risk related to accounts receivable through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures. The Company routinely
assesses the financial strength of its customers and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk, establishes an allowance,
if required, for uncollectible accounts and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond
such allowance is limited.  

Risks
and Uncertainties   

The
Company is subject to risks from, among other things, competition associated with the industry in general, other risks associated
with financing, liquidity requirements, rapidly changing customer requirements, limited operating history, foreign currency exchange
rates and the volatility of public markets.  

Contingencies   

Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will
only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company s management and legal counsel assess
such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal
proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company s
legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of
the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.  

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements. If the assessment
indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be
estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable
and material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they
involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

Cash
and equivalents include cash in hand and cash in demand deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments
with original maturities of three months or less. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no uninsured balances
for accounts in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts
and believes it is not exposed to any risks on its cash in bank accounts.  

Trade
Receivable   

All
trade receivables are due thirty (30) days from the date billed. If the funds are not received within thirty (30) days the customer
is contacted to arrange payment. The Company uses the allowance method to account for uncollectable trade receivables. The allowance
for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 was $14,239 and $14,368, respectively.  

Financing
Receivables and Guarantees   

The
Company provides financing arrangements, including operating leases and financed service contracts for certain qualified customers.
Lease receivables primarily represent sales-type and direct-financing leases. Leases typically have two- to three-year terms and
are collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. The Company makes an allowance for uncollectible financing
receivables based on a variety of factors, including the risk rating of the portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, historical experience,
and other market factors. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 management determined that there was no allowance necessary.
The Company also provides financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements to channel
partners and other customers. The Company could be called upon to make payment under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment
to the third party.  

Advertising
Costs   

The
Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $335,034 and $278,516 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Inventory   

Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a weighted average basis) or market. Management compares the cost of inventories
with the market value and allowance is made to write down inventories to market value, if lower. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, inventory only consisted of finished goods. During the third quarter, we determined that the touch tablets
we ordered from our supplier in China in 2015 were no longer suitable for installations due to technical and quality issues that
we discovered over the last year at various installation sites. An estimated value of $109,170 has been written off from inventory.  

Fixed
Assets   

Fixed
assets are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the
asset or the lease term. The useful life for rental equipment was adjusted for the tag to 5 years from 10 years, and for the Touch/Text,
the useful life was adjusted to 5 years from 8 years. The adjustment properly reflects the average lease term for the rental equipment
and the average life of the product. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows:  

Rental
    equipment  

Tag  
      5
    year useful life   
 
      Touch/Text  
      5

      5
    year useful life   
 
      Computer
    equipment  
      3
    year useful life   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, fixed assets consisted of the following:  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, leased equipment consisted of the following:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, total depreciation expense was $11,755 and $6,924 for the fixed assets and
leased equipment, respectively.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, total depreciation expense was $39,692 and $25,377 for the fixed assets and
leased equipment, respectively.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

For
certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.
ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ,  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial
instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825,   Financial Instruments ,  defines fair value, and establishes
a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value
measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify
as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination
of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy
are defined as follows:  

Level
1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  

Level
2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.  

Level
3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.  

The
Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC Topic 480,   Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity ,  and ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging .   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not identify any assets and liabilities that are required to be presented
on the balance sheet at fair value.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share   

Basic
and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Our potentially dilutive shares, which include
outstanding convertible loans and notes, have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable
to common stockholders for all periods presented, as the results would be antidilutive. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded
when the effect would be to reduce net loss per share.  

The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015:  

Intangible
Assets   

The
Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each
asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of software development capitalized. Finite-lived intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 1 to 20 years.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

We
recognize all share-based payments to employees and to non-employee directors as compensation for service on our board of directors
as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair values of such payments. Stock-based compensation
expense recognized each period is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected
to vest during the period. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  

For
share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the  measurement date. 
The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation
expense remains uncertain. We record compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards
to consultants and other third-parties are then revalued, or the total compensation is recalculated based on the then current
fair value, at each subsequent reporting date.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

There
have been no new accounting pronouncements during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that we believe would have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.  

Going
Concern   

As
reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $25,955,168 as of September 30,
2016 and had a net loss of $1,486,677 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

While
the Company is attempting to grow revenues, improve margins and lower costs, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient
to support the Company s daily operations. Management is seeking to raise additional funds by way of a public or private
offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues
provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy
to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and
generate revenues.  

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

Reclassification   

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no
effect on the reported results of operations or cash flow.

12   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

On March 31, 2015 the Company entered into
an agreement with a marketing firm that is owned by one of the directors of the Company. The terms included cash payment of $17,500

$280,000 and the remaining $30,000 is recorded as a prepaid deposit. As of September 30, 2016, the Director of the Company has
filed a notice of default on March 31, 2016 in regards to the related party convertible note on the financial statements of DSG
TAG. The note was issued in lieu of marketing services, the note maturity date is March 31, 2016. DSG TAG is currently

The
following are the components of income before income tax reflected in the Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015:  

Component
of Loss Before Income Tax and Noncontrolling Interest  

Deferred
income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating
the ability to recover the deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, the Company considered all available
positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax
planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, the Company began with historical results
adjusted for changes in accounting policies and incorporates assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income,
the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions
require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimate the Company
are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, the Company
consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss).  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had net operating losses, or NOLs, of approximately $26.0 million to offset future taxable
income in Canada and the United Kingdom. The deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016 were fully reserved. Management believes
it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized in the near future.  

Note
14   GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT INFORMATION

15   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

Lease
Obligations   

The
Company leases offices in Canada under a renewable operating lease which will expire on January 31, 2017, following which the
term of the lease is month to month, with 30 days  notice to terminate. The lease term was extended by an additional nine
months subject to leasing our current space or another office in the building. The annual rent for the premises in Canada is approximately
$66,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate rental expense was $52,695 and $62,110, respectively.
Rent expense included other amounts paid in Canada and the United Kingdom for warehouse storage and offices on a month-to-month
or as-needed basis.  

The
Company signed an operating lease agreement through National Leasing for a photocopier. The lease terms are for 60 months commencing
on May 22, 2015 and ending April 22, 2020 with a monthly lease payment of approximately $183.  

The
following table summarizes our future minimum payments under these arrangements as of September 30, 2016:  

Product
Warranties   

The
Company s product warranty costs are part of its cost of sales based on associated material product costs, labor costs for
technical support staff, and associated overhead. The products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year.
As of December 31, 2015 the Company has set up a reserve for future warranty costs, at September 30, 2016 the recorded reserve
was $115,305. The Company s past experience with warranty related costs was used as a basis for the reserve. Prior to December
31, 2015 the Company expensed warranty costs as incurred. The warranty expense incurred was $161,762 and $148,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

In
the normal course of business, the Company indemnifies other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions
with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed to hold the other parties harmless against losses arising
from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain
parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In
addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, and the Company s bylaws
contain similar indemnification obligations to the Company s agents. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential
amount under these indemnification agreements due to the Company s limited history with prior indemnification claims and
the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these
agreements have not had a material effect on the Company s operating results, financial position, or cash flows.

Corporate
History   

DSG
Global, Inc. (formerly Boreal Productions Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 24, 2007.
We were formed to option feature films and TV projects to be packaged and sold to movie studios and production companies.  

In
January 2015, we changed our name to DSG Global, Inc. and effected a one-for-three reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding
common stock in anticipation of entering in a share exchange agreement with DSG TAG Systems, Inc., a corporation incorporated
under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 17, 2008 and extra provincially registered in British Columbia, Canada in 2008.  

On
April 13, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement with DSG TAG Systems Inc. and the shareholders of DSG TAG Systems who
become parties to the agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, we agreed to acquire not less than 75%
and up to 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares in the capital stock of DSG TAG Systems in exchange for the issuance
to the selling shareholders of up to 20,000,000 shares of our common stock on the basis of 1 common share for 5.4935 common shares
of DSG TAG Systems.  

On
May 6, 2015, we completed the acquisition of approximately 75% (82,435,748 common shares) of the issued and outstanding common
shares of DSG TAG Systems as contemplated by the share exchange agreement by issuing 15,185,875 shares of our common stock to
shareholders of DSG TAG Systems who became parties to the agreement. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the share exchange
agreement, we issued an additional 179,823 shares of our common stock to Westergaard Holdings Ltd. in partial settlement of accrued
interest on outstanding indebtedness of DSG TAG Systems.  

Following
the initial closing of the share exchange agreement and through October 22, 2015, we acquired an additional 101,200 shares of
common stock of DSG TAG Systems from shareholders who became parties to the share exchange agreement, and issued to these shareholders
an aggregate of 18,422 shares of our common stock. Following completion of these additional purchases, DSG Global owns approximately
100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of DSG TAG Systems. An aggregate of 4,229,384 shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock of DSG TAG Systems continues to be held by Westergaard Holdings Ltd., an affiliate of Keith Westergaard, a member
of our board of directors.  

The
reverse acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein DSG TAG Systems is considered
the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity have been brought
forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized. We adopted the business and operations of DSG TAG Systems upon
the closing of the share exchange agreement.  

Overview
of Our Business   

DSG
Global, Inc. is a technology development company based in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, engaged in the design, manufacture,
and marketing of fleet management solutions for the golf industry, as well as commercial, government and military applications.
Our principal activities are the sale and rental of GPS tracking devices and interfaces for golf vehicles, and related support
services. We were founded by a group of individuals who have dedicated their careers to fleet management technologies and have
been at the forefront of the industry s most innovative developments, and our executive team has over 50 years of experience
in the design and manufacture of wireless, GPS, and fleet tracking solutions. We have developed the TAG suite of products that
we believe is the first completely modular fleet management solution for the golf industry. The TAG suite of products is currently
sold and installed around the world in golf facilities and as commercial applications through a network of established distributors
and partnerships with some of the most notable brands in fleet and equipment manufacture.  

DSG
stands for  Digital Security Guard , which is our primary value statement giving fleet operator s new capabilities
to track and control their vehicles. We have developed a proprietary combination of hardware and software that is marketed around
the world as the TAG system. We have primarily focused on the golf industry where the TAG system is deployed to help golf course
operators manage their fleet of golf carts, turf equipment, and utility vehicles. We are a leader in the category of fleet management
in the golf industry and were awarded  Best Technology of the Year  in 2010 by Boardroom magazine, a publication of
the National Golf Course Owners Association. To date the TAG system is installed on over 8,000 vehicles and has been used to monitor
over 6,000,000 rounds of golf.  

The
TAG system fills a void in the marketplace by offering a modular structure that allows the customer to customize their system
to meet desired functionality and budget constraints. In addition to the core TAG system vehicle control functionality, which
can operate independently, we offer two golfer information display systems   the alphanumeric TEXT and high definition TOUCH
  providing the operator with two display options which is unique in the industry.  

The
primary market for our TAG system is the 40,000 golf operations worldwide. While the golf industry remains the primary focus of
our sales and marketing efforts, we have completed several successful pilots of the TAG system in other markets such as agriculture
and commercial fleet operations. With appropriate resources, we intend to expand our sales and marketing efforts into these new
markets.  

We
have a direct sales force in North America, which comprises the most significant portion of the golf fleet market, and have developed
key relationships with distributors and golf equipment manufacturers such as E-Z-GO, Yamaha and Ransomes Jacobsen to help drive
sales for the North American and worldwide markets.  

In
order to successfully deliver products, increase sales, and maintain customer satisfaction, we need to have a reliable supplier
of our hardware units and components at competitive prices. Presently, we source our TOUCH units from one supplier in China and
our TAG units from one supplier in the United Kingdom. We have recently established a new relationship with a supplier for our
TOUCH units in China to provide us with higher quality, newer technology at competitive pricing. We are also exploring the opportunity
of a partnership with a US manufacturer.  

In
addition, DSG is currently in negotiations with a telecommunications provider to provide new technology in hardware and wireless
access.  

Our
Revenue Model   

We
derive revenue from four different sources, as follows:  

Systems
    Sales Revenue  , which consists of the sales price paid by those customers who purchase or lease our TAG system hardware.   

Monthly
    Service Fees   are paid by all customers for the wireless data fee charges required to operate the GPS tracking on the
    TAG systems.   

Monthly
    Rental Fees   are paid by those customers that rent the TAG system hardware. The amount of a customer s monthly
    payment varies based on the type of equipment rented (a TAG, a TAG and TEXT, or a TAG and TOUCH).   

Advertising
    Revenue   is a new source of revenue that we believe has the potential to be strategic for us in the future. We are
    in the process of implementing and designing software to provide advertising and other media functionality on our TOUCH units.   

We
recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable,
and collectability is reasonably assured. In instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer, revenue
is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. We accrue for warranty costs, sales returns, and other allowances based
on its historical experience.  

Our
revenue recognition policies are discussed in more detail under   Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
in the notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.  

Cost
of Revenue    

Our
cost of revenue consists primarily of hardware purchases, wireless data fees, mapping, installation costs, freight expenses and
inventory adjustments.  

Hardware
    purchases.   Our equipment purchases consist primarily of TAG system control units, TEXT display, and TOUCH display
    tablets. The TAG system control unit is sold as a stand-alone unit or in conjunction with our TEXT alphanumeric display or
    TOUCH high definition  touch activated  display. Hardware purchases also include costs of components used during
    installations, such as cables, mounting solutions, and other miscellaneous equipment.   

Wireless
    data fees.   Our wireless data fees consist primarily of the data fees charged by outside providers of GPS tracking
    used in all of our TAG system control units.   

Mapping.
      Our mapping costs consist of aerial mapping, course map, geofencing, and 3D flyovers for golf courses. This cost is
    incurred at the time of hardware installation.   

Installation.
      Our installation costs consist primarily of costs incurred by our employed service technicians for the cost of travel,
    meals, and miscellaneous components required during installations. In addition, these costs also include fees paid to external
    contractors for installations on a project by project basis.   

Freight
    expenses and Inventory adjustments.   Our freight expenses consist primarily of costs to ship hardware to courses for
    installations. Our inventory adjustments include inventory write offs, write downs, and other adjustments to the cost of inventory.   

Operating
    Expenses   Other Income (Expenses)   We classify our operating expenses and other income (expenses) into six categories:
    compensation, research and development, general and administrative, warranty, foreign currency exchange, and finance costs.
    Our operating expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing, salaries and wages, consulting fees, professional fees, trade
    shows, software development, and allocated costs. Allocated costs include charges for facilities, office expenses, telephones
    and other miscellaneous expenses. Our other income (expenses) primarily consists of financing costs and foreign exchange gains
    or losses.   

Compensation
    expense.   Our compensation expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, such as employee salaries, payroll expenses,
    and employee benefits. This includes salaries for management, administration, engineering, sales and marketing, and service
    support technicians. Salaries and wages directly related to projects or research and development are expensed as incurred
    to their operating expense category.   

Research
    and development  . Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and professional services
    associated with the ongoing development and maintenance of our technology.   

Research
    and development expenses include payroll, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research
    and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs. Such costs related to software development
    are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached. Research and development
    is expensed and is included in operating expenses.   

General
    and administrative  . Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing, commissions,
    travel, trade shows, consultant fees, insurance, and compliance and other administrative functions, as well as accounting
    and legal professional services fees, allocated costs and other corporate expenses. Sales and marketing includes brand marketing,
    marketing materials, and media management.   

Warranty
    expense.   Our warranty expenses consist primarily of associated material product costs, labor costs for technical support
    staff, and other associated overhead. Warranty costs are expensed as they are incurred.   

Foreign
    currency exchange.   Our foreign currency exchange consists primarily of foreign exchange fluctuations recorded in Canadian
    dollar (CAD), British Pounds (GBP), or Euro (EUR) at the rates of exchange in effect when the transaction occurred.   

Finance
    costs.   Our finance costs consist primarily of investor interest expense, investor commission fees, and other financing
    charges for obtaining debt financing.   

We
expect to continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and incur additional expenses associated with being a public company,
including increased legal and accounting costs, investor relations costs, higher insurance premiums and compliance costs associated
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute
dollars in future periods. In particular, we expect to incur additional marketing costs to support the expansion of our offerings
in new markets like commercial fleet management and agriculture.  

Additional
Capital    

We
require additional capital to continue to develop software and products, meet our contractual obligations, and execute our business
plan. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all, which would adversely
affect our ability to achieve our business objectives.  

Results
of Operations   

We
had a net loss of $673,937 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, which was $152,052 more than the net loss of $521,885
for the three month period ended September 30, 2015.  

We
had a net loss of $1,486,677 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, which was $70,774 more than the net loss of $1,415,903
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  

The
following table summarizes key items of comparison and their related increase (decrease) for the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Comparison
of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Revenue    

Revenue
decreased by $194,976, or 44.5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015 and decreased by $716,946, or 42.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The decreases was primarily due to lower sales in 2016 and continued design and redevelopment of our product
line.  

Due
to the redevelopment of our product line, it has created lower sales overall than anticipated. We have been forced to move to
a 3G/4G GPS cellular device, require redevelopment of our advertising, and also software development delays in integrating the
tournament software onto the TOUCH screen, all of which that has caused delays in sales. Our company along with the new sales
team is aggressively building its pipeline for the next year.  

Cost
of Revenue    

Cost
of revenue decreased by $43,912, or 18.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months September
30, 2015 and decreased by $537,889 or 55.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The table below outlines the differences in detail:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, the decrease was primarily
due to lower level of equipment sales. As a result, cost of goods decreased by $74,411 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Installation costs, such as direct labor decreased by $17,409,
mapping and freight costs decreased by $168, and wireless fees decreased by $36,430. During the third quarter, we determined that
the touch tablets we ordered from our supplier in China in 2015 were no longer suitable for installations due to technical and
quality issues that we discovered over the last year at various installation sites. An estimated value of $85,185 has been written
off for the touch tablets.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the overall decrease of 55.8%
was due to the decrease in hardware leases and sales. Lower costs of revenue as mentioned above was also due to a contract lease
renewal that had no hardware costs associated. Lower sales also resulted in lower installation costs, freight charges, mapping,
and direct labor costs in the nine months ended in September 30, 2016 in comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Installation costs, such as direct labor decreased by $46,048, cost of goods decreased by $470,188, mapping and freight costs
decreased by $30,896. Wireless fees also decreased by $85,549 which was due to new lower negotiated wireless fee rates. An
estimated value of $109,170 has been written off for the touch tablets.  

Compensation
Expense    

Compensation
expense decreased by $68,494, or 26.9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015 and decreased by $11,752, or 2.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to our continued efforts to reduce costs.  

Research
and Development    

Research
and development expense increased by $11,253, or 164.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015 and increased by $12,752, or 30.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As indicated, we expect research and development expenses to increase as we enter new
markets like commercial fleet management, agriculture, and advertising. This increase in costs will be required to develop the
new 3G/4G GPS cellular device.  

General
and Administration Expense    

General
  administration expense decreased by $52,118, or 15.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015 and decreased 278,206, or 25.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The table below outlines the differences in detail:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, the decrease of $36,430 in
accounting and legal fees was due to the costs associated with the merger in May 6, 2015. In the three months ended September
30, 2016, the costs primarily consisted of regular fees associated with the filing requirements. Marketing and advertising increased
by $90,274, this was a result of more aggressive marketing efforts. Subcontractors and commissions decreased by $49,185, this
was due to the hiring of more employees instead of contract workers. Office expense, rent, software, bank   credit card charges,
telephone, and travel and meals combined has decreased by $55,953 or 40%, reflecting increased efforts to minimize costs.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the decrease of $116,957 in
accounting and legal fees was overall due to the higher costs associated with the merger in May 2015, as well the decrease was
also due to efforts in decreasing legal costs for public filing requirements. There was a decrease of $113,425 in subcontractor
and commissions due to the hiring of more employees instead of contract workers and lower sales resulting in less commissions
being paid. There was an increase of $11,111 in hardware design for the development of the new hardware prototype for tradeshows.
Overall, there was a decrease of $278,205 or 26% in office and computer expense, rent, operations software, bank and interest
charges, travel, and meals for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
reflecting our efforts of saving costs.  

Warranty
Expense    

Warranty
expense increased by $6,727, or 15.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015 and increased by $13,762, or 9.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in warranty expense was mostly due to the additional repairs required because of the technical issues with
our touch tablets that we ordered in 2015 from a supplier in China. As of September 30, 2016, our balance sheet included a reserve
of $114,355 for future warranty costs. No reserve was used in prior periods, and warranty costs were expensed as incurred.  

Foreign
Currency Exchange    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a $23,816 loss in foreign currency transaction as compared to $27,174
in foreign currency transaction loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we recognized a $27,386 gain in foreign currency transactions as compared to $62,556 in foreign exchange losses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease and increase was primarily due to the gains or losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations
on payables, receivables, and other foreign exchange transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies
of the legal entities in which the transactions are recorded. Foreign currency fluctuations are primarily from the Canadian Dollar,
Euro and British pound.  

Finance
Costs    

Finance
costs increased by $105,199 or 220.1%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015 and increased $244,004, or 128.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase overall was primarily due to accrued interest expensed from additional loans and note convertible loans
obtained after the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
Loss Attributable to DSG Global    

As
a result of the above factors, net loss after noncontrolling interest attributable to DSG Global increased by $126,379, or 28.8%
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and increased $61,925,
or 5.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The overall increase
was primarily due to increased finance costs despite of efforts to lower operating costs in general and administrative expenses.  

In
addition, for the months ended September 30, 2016, Total Other Expenses represented 27.5% of the net loss, and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, Total Other Expenses represented 28.0% of the net loss. These expenses include foreign exchange differences
and fluctuations, and accrued interest on loans payable and other convertible notes.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

From
our incorporation in April 17, 2008 through September 30, 2016, we have financed our operations, capital expenditures and working
capital needs through the sale of common shares and the incurrence of indebtedness, including term loans, convertible loans, revolving
lines of credit and purchase order financing. At September 30, 2016, we had $2,544,775 in outstanding indebtedness, which all
matures within the next twelve months.  

We
had cash in the amount of $0 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $39,123 as of September 30, 2015. We had a working capital
deficit of $ 4,595,002 as of September 30, 2016 compared to working capital deficit of $ 2,267,226 as of September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Financial Condition    

Our
financial position as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the changes for the periods then ended are as follows:  

Working
Capital    

Cash
Flow Analysis    

Our
cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are summarized as follows:  

Net
Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities  . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in operations
totaled $472,808. This reflects the net loss of $1,486,677 less $1,013,869 provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities
and adjustments for non-cash items. Cash provided by working capital items was primarily impacted by a decrease in prepaid expense
and deposits of $63,435, a decrease in related party receivable of $79,471, a decrease of $254,359 in inventories, an increase
in trade payables of $487,653, and an increase in deferred revenue of $55,794.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in operations totaled $292,829. This reflects a net loss of $1,186,046 less
$893,217 provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities and adjustments for non-cash items. Cash provided by working
capital items was primarily impacted by $297,700 for non-cash financing costs for notes issued for services, a decrease of prepaid
expense and deposits of $255,584, an increase of inventory of $155,576, and an increase in trade payables of $557,872.  

Net
Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities  . Investing activities reduced cash by $6,713 in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, and increased cash by $106,119 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, of which $85,531 was acquired
as part of our reverse acquisition transaction.  

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities  . Net cash from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
totaled $484,903, mostly from various note and loan facilities entered during the period. Net cash provided by financing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $141,909, from various note and loan facilities entered during the period.  

Outstanding
Indebtedness    

Our
current indebtedness as of September 30, 2016 is comprised of the following. For loans that have expired terms, we are in talks
with the lenders to extend them. The company must increase revenue or raise more equity capital to meet the payment obligations.  

Preferred
Stock Redemption Obligations    

Westergaard
Holdings Ltd., an affiliate of Keith Westergaard, a former member of our board of directors, owns 4,229,384 shares (the  Series
A Shares ) of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of DSG TAG Systems. Pursuant to a Subscription / Debt Settlement Agreement
dated September 26, 2014 between DSG TAG Systems and Westergaard Holdings, as amended on April 29, 2016, DSG TAG Systems has agreed
that DSG Global, Inc. will complete financings for gross proceeds of at least $10 million and use a portion of the proceeds to
redeem all of the Series A Shares at a price of $1.25 per share, as follows:  

If
we fail to satisfy the above described financing and share redemption schedule, we will be in default of the Subscription and
Debt Settlement Agreement which would entitle the holder of the Preferred Shares to convert the Series A Convertible Preferred
Shares into common shares in the capital of DSG Global at the price of $1.25 per share.  

Prospective
Capital Needs    

We
estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the twelve month period beginning October 1, 2016 to be as
follows:  

As
noted earlier, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in operations totaled $472,808. The relatively low level
of cash used compared to our estimated working capital needs in the future was the result of accumulation of vendor payables.
We need to reduce the current level of payables in the near future to keep a good relationship with our vendors and expand our
sales and service team to achieve our operational objectives. At present, our cash requirements for the next 12 months outweigh
the funds available. Of the $2,920,000 that we require for the next 12 months, we had $0 in cash as of December 1, 2016, and a
working capital deficit of $4,595,002. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from product sales. In order to achieve
sustained profitability and positive cash flows from operations, we will need to increase revenue and/or reduce operating expenses.
Our ability to maintain, or increase, current revenue levels to achieve and sustain profitability will depend, in part, on demand
for our products.  

In
order to improve our liquidity, we also plan to pursue additional equity financing from private investors or possibly a registered
public offering. We do not currently have any definitive arrangements in place for the completion of any further private placement
financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further private placement financings. To help
finance our day to day working capital needs, the founder and CEO of the company has made a total payment of $108,651 since late
2015. If we are unable to achieve the necessary additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our
business activities and administrative expenses in order to be within the amount of capital resources obligations, and execute
our business plan. We have already suspended payments of management compensation to our CEO since October 2015. There can be no
assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all, which would adversely affect our ability
to achieve our business objectives.  

On
November 7, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Coastal Investment Partners. Pursuant to the agreement,
Coastal Investment provided us with cash proceeds of $125,000 on November 10, 2016. In exchange, we issued a secured convertible
promissory note in the principal amount of $138,888.89 (the  $138,888.89 Note ), inclusive of an 8% original issue
discount, which bears interest at 8% per annum to the holder. The $138,888.89 Note matures six months from issuance and is convertible
at the option of the holder into our common shares at a price per share that is the lower of $0. 12 or the closing price of our
common stock on the conversion date.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Transactions   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements
also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and
expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management.
To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statements presentation,
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.  

We
believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, foreign currency and foreign currency transactions
and comprehensive loss have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these
to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see
the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

The
phrase  disclosure controls and procedures  refers to controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange
Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed
to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our interim chief executive officer,
or Interim CEO, and chief financial officer, or CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decision regarding required disclosure.  

Our
management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2016,
our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules
13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the first quarter of 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures   

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  

PART
II: OTHER INFORMATION    

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    

On
June 4, 2015, a lawsuit was commenced against DSG TAG Systems Inc. in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, captioned Amanda
McGuire v. DSG TAG Systems Inc., No. S-154634, Vancouver Registry. The plaintiff alleges that a promissory note in the principal
amount of $100,000 CDN issued by DSG TAG Systems was not converted into common shares of DSG TAG Systems, as asserted by DSG TAG
Systems, and the plaintiff seeks repayment of indebtedness in the amount of $100,000 CDN plus interest and costs. An agreement
was reached on August 13, 2015 between DSG TAG Systems and the plaintiff, pursuant to which DSG TAG Systems agreed to pay the
plaintiff $119,700 CDN in monthly installations of $17,100 CDN, the first payment commencing on October 1, 2015, and the plaintiff
agreed to exchange 101,200 shares of common stock of DSG Tag Systems for 18,422 shares of common stock of DSG Global, which exchange
occurred on October 22, 2015.  

On
December 3, 2015, a second action lawsuit was commenced against DSG TAG Systems Inc. in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,
captioned Amanda McGuire v. DSG TAG Systems and DSG Global Inc., No. S-1510050, Vancouver Registry. The plaintiff filed a claim
for default on the settlement agreement entered in on August 13, 2015 due to non-payment. On February 20, 2016, a new agreement
was reached between DSG TAG Systems and the plaintiff, pursuant to which DSG TAG Systems agreed to pay the plaintiff $86,780 CDN

schedule to the shareholder per the settlement agreement. DSG TAG was ordered to repay the remaining loan plus costs in the amount
of $77,589 to the shareholder in 14 monthly payments of $5,500 each plus $589 at the 15th month starting February 15, 2017.  

On
September 7, 2016, a vendor has filed a Complaint for Damage in Florida (Case Number: CACE-16-016663) to recover unpaid invoice
amount of $27,335 plus interest of $4,939. The invoice was not paid due to a dispute that DSG TAG did not think that vendor had
delivered the service according to the agreement between the two parties.

cannot be predicted with certainty, and the resolution of any future matters could materially affect our future financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

On
November 7, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Coastal Investment Partners. Pursuant to the agreement,
Coastal Investment provided us with cash proceeds of $125,000 on November 10, 2016. In exchange, we issued a secured convertible
promissory note in the principal amount of $138,888.89 (the  $138,888.89 Note ), inclusive of an 8% original issue
discount, which bears interest at 8% per annum to the holder. The $138,888.89 Note matures six months from issuance and is convertible
at the option of the holder into our common shares at a price per share that is the lower of $0. 12 or the closing price of our
common stock on the conversion date. In addition, under the same terms, the company also issued a secured convertible note of
$50,000 in consideration of cash proceeds of $10,000 and another secured convertible note of $75,000 in consideration of cash
proceeds of $10,000.
