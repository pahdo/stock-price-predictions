  (Unaudited)  

Note 1   Basis of presentation   

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included herein, presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and stated in US dollars,   have been prepared by All-American SportPark, Inc. (the  Company ), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  

These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein.  It is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K.  The Company follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of consolidated interim reports.  

Results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of annual results.  

Certain reclassifications have been made in prior periods  financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current period.  

On June 10, 2016, the Company entered into a Transfer Agreement for the sale and transfer of the Company s 51% interest in All American Golf Center, Inc. ( AAGC ), which constituted substantially all of the Company s assets.  On October 18, 2016, the Company completed the closing of the Transfer Agreement pursuant to which the Company transferred the 51% interest in AAGC to Ronald Boreta and John Boreta (the  Boretas ), and also issued to the Boretas 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, in exchange for the cancellation of promissory notes held by the Boretas and the interest accrued thereon totaling approximately $8,613,000.  

In connection with the closing of the Transfer Agreement, AAGC assumed the obligation of the Company to pay Ronald Boreta for deferred salary which currently totals approximately $320,000. In addition, AAGC cancelled approximately $4,125,000 in advances previously made by it to the Company to fund its operations.  

Also in connection with the closing of the Transfer Agreement, entities controlled by the Boretas cancelled approximately $1,367,000 owed to them by the Company. The Company cancelled approximately $27,605 owed to the Company by entities controlled by the Boretas.  

As a result of the closing of the Transfer Agreement, the Company now has no or nominal operations and no or nominal assets and is therefore considered to be a  Shell Company  as that

term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.  

Note 2   Discontinued Operations   

As of September 30, 2016 the business activities of All-American Golf Center (AAGC) are deemed held for sale in accordance with ASC 205. All references to discontinued operations included the operations of AAGC only.   

Results of Discontinued Operations:  

The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are set forth as below:  

5 

6  

Note 3   Going concern   

   As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $28,662,139.  The Company s management believes that its operations may not be sufficient to fund operating cash needs and debt service requirements over at least the next 12 months. As described in Note 1, the Company s Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of the Company to enter into the Transfer Agreement with the Boretas.  The closing of that agreement would result in the elimination of nearly all of the debt of the Company.  However, after the closing, the Company would have no significant assets and would continue to depend on affiliates to provide funds to pay its ongoing expenses.   

  The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Note 4   Recent accounting policies   

The Company believes there are no new accounting pronouncements adopted but not yet effective that is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.  

Note 5   Non controlling interest   

Non-controlling interest represents the minority stockholders  proportionate share of the equity of All-American Golf Center ("AAGC') which is a 51% owned subsidiary of the Company. At September 30, 2015, we owned 51% of AAGC s capital stock, representing voting control and a majority interest. Our controlling ownership interest required that AAGC s operations be included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. The 49% equity interest that is not owned by us is shown as  Non-controlling interest in consolidated subsidiary  in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.    

Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, at the closing on October 18, 2016, we transferred our 51% interest in AAGC, which constituted substantially all of our assets, to the Boretas.  

Note 6   Related party transactions   

Due to related parties   

Prior to October 18, 2016, the Company s employees provided administrative/accounting support for (a) three golf retail stores,  named Saint Andrews Golf Shop ("SAGS"), Las Vegas Golf and Tennis ("Boca Store") and Las Vegas Golf and Tennis Superstore ( Westside 15 Store ), owned by Ronald Boreta, the Company's President, and his brother, John Boreta, a Director of the Company. The SAGS store is the retail tenant in the TMGE.   

Administrative/accounting payroll and employee benefits expenses were allocated based on an annual review of the personnel time expended for each entity. Amounts allocated to these related parties by the Company approximated $21,903 and $  20,409   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded this allocation by reducing the related expenses and allocating them to the related parties.    

7 

In addition to the administrative/accounting support provided by the Company to the above stores, the Company received funding for operations from these and various other stores owned by the Company s President and his brother, and the former Chairman. These funds helped pay for office supplies, phone charges, postages, and salaries. The net amount due to these stores totaled $1,247,582 and $1,213,066 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The amounts were non-interest bearing and due out of available cash flows of the Company. Additionally, the Company has the right to offset the administrative/accounting support against the funds received from these stores.   

  Through October 18, 2016, both Ronald Boreta and John Boreta continued to defer half of their monthly salaries until the Company is in a more positive financial state.  The amounts deferred for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 were $73,125 and $73,125, respectively. The obligations to pay the deferred salaries were assumed by AAGC in connection with the closing of the Transfer Agreement.   

   Notes and Interest Payable to Related Parties:   

  The Company had various notes and interest payable to the following entities as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively:

Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to transfer a 49% interest in our wholly owned subsidiary, AAGC as a partial principal payment in the amount of $600,000 on the Company s outstanding loan due to St. Andrews Golf Shop, Ltd. In March 2009, the Company engaged the services of an independent third party business valuation firm, Houlihan Valuation Advisors, to determine the fair value of the business and the corresponding minority interest. Based on the Minority Value Estimate presented in connection with this appraisal, which included valuations utilizing the income, market and transaction approaches in its valuation methodology, the fair value of a 49% interest totaled $600,000.  

  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued interest payable - related parties related to the notes payable   related parties totaled $5,564,106 and $5,336,996, respectively   .    On October 18, 2016 all of the notes and accrued interest were cancelled as part of the closing of the Transfer Agreement.

  AAGC subleases space in the clubhouse to SAGS. Base rent includes $13,104 per month through July 2013 with a 5% increase for each of two 5-year options to extend in July 2013 and July 2017. For the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized rental income totaling $122,850 and $122,850, respectively.  

   Note 7   Commitments   

Lease Agreements From Discontinued Operation   

The land underlying the TMGE is leased under an operating lease that was to initially expire in 2013 and had two five-year renewal options.  In March 2006, the Company exercised the first of two options, extending the lease to 2018.  Also, the lease has a provision for contingent rent to be paid by AAGC upon reaching certain levels of gross revenues.  The Company recognized the minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, which included the renewal options.  

9 

At September 30, 2016, minimum future lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases   were as follows: 

Total rent expense for this operating lease was $397,380 and $397,380 for the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015.  

Capital Lease From Discontinued Operation   

The Company entered into a capital lease for new Club Car gas powered golf carts.  The lease is 48 months in length and started on December 8, 2013.  The Company paid $2,887 a month in principal and interest expense related to the lease.  

The following is a schedule by year of future minimum payments required under these lease agreements.  

Customer Agreement From Discontinued Operation   

  On June 19, 2009, AAGC entered into a Customer Agreement with Callaway Golf Company ("Callaway") and Saint Andrews pursuant to which Callaway has agreed to make certain cash payments and other consideration to AAGC and Saint Andrews in exchange for an exclusive marketing arrangement for the golf center operated by AAGC. Callaway is a major golf equipment manufacturer and supplier.  

  On March 9, 2013, AAGC entered into an amendment to its Customer Agreement with Callaway (the  Amendment ). The Amendment provided that AAGC was to use all reasonable efforts to negotiate and enter into a non-exclusive written contract with an alternative retail branding partner. In the event that AAGC was successful in executing a written contract with an alternative retail branding partner, the Customer Agreement would terminate on June 30, 2013.  

  Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment, Callaway was not required to pay any marketing funds or other fees or expenses required under the Customer Agreement during the first two quarters of   

 10

2013. The Amendment also provided that Callaway could, at its option, continue to feature its products in a second position at the golf center  ,   of which they have chosen to do,   after   termination of the Customer Agreement, under certain terms and conditions.  

   Sponsorship Agreement   

  On March 27, 2013, AAGC entered into a Golf Center Sponsorship Agreement ( Sponsorship Agreement ) with Taylor Made Golf Company, Inc., doing business as TaylorMade-adidas Golf Company ( TMaG ) pursuant to which the golf center operated by AAGC was to be rebranded using TaylorMade  and other TMaG trademarks.  

  As part of the Sponsorship Agreement, TMaG agreed to reimburse AAGC for the reasonable costs associated with the rebranding efforts, including the costs associated with the build-out of the golf center and a new performance lab (described below), up to a specified maximum amount. In addition AAGC received a payment of $200,000 upon execution of the Sponsorship Agreement and, so long as AAGC continues to operate the golf center and comply with the terms and conditions of the Sponsorship Agreement TMaG was to make additional payments to AAGC on each of March 26, 2014 and March 26, 2015.  

  The Sponsorship Agreement provides that TMaG would install a performance lab at AAGC's facility that would include one nine-camera motion analysis system and one putting lab, and would provide additional services, equipment, supplies and resources for the golf center. The performance lab was installed in 2013.  Phase I of the remodeling of the golf center included the entire golf shop, activities area/golf check-in and restaurant area and was completed in the first quarter of 2015.  Phase II began in the third quarter of 2015 and involved remodeling the driving range area and additional construction in the golf shop.  

  The Sponsorship Agreement includes provisions concerning the display of TMaG merchandise, payment terms, retail sales targets and other related matters. Also, Saint Andrews Golf Shop, a tenant of AAGC which is owned by Ronald Boreta, the Company's President, and John Boreta, a Director of the Company, will receive a quarterly rebate based on the wholesale price of the TMaG merchandise purchased at the golf center. In addition, provided that the Las Vegas Golf and Tennis stores owned by Ronald Boreta and John Boreta maintain TMaG as their premier vendor at its locations, TMaG will pay such stores a quarterly rebate based on the wholesale price of the TMaG merchandise purchased at those locations.  

  The initial term of the Sponsorship Agreement is for five years. AAGC and TMaG may mutually agree in writing to extend the Sponsorship Agreement for an additional four year period; provided that the option to renew the Agreement shall be determined by the parties not later than ninety (90) days prior to the end of the initial term and shall be consistent with the AAGC's lease on its golf center property.

Note 8   Subsequent Events   

After a review of all business dealings, the Company determined that it had no subsequent events to disclose except as set forth below.  

On October 18, 2016, the Company completed the closing of its previously disclosed Transfer Agreement for the sale and transfer of the Company s 51% interest in All American Golf Center, Inc. ( AAGC ), which constituted substantially all of the Company s assets.  Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, the Company transferred the 51% interest in AAGC to Ronald Boreta and John Boreta (the  Boretas ), and also issued to the Boretas 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, in exchange for the cancellation of promissory notes held by the Boretas and the interest accrued thereon totaling approximately $8,613,000.  

In connection with the closing of the Transfer Agreement, AAGC assumed the obligation of the Company to pay Ronald Boreta for deferred salary which currently totals approximately $320,000. In addition, AAGC cancelled approximately $4,125,000 in advances previously made by it to the Company to fund its operations.  

Also in connection with the closing of the Transfer Agreement, entities controlled by the Boretas cancelled approximately $1,367,000 owed to them by the Company. The Company cancelled approximately $27,605 owed to the Company by entities controlled by the Boretas.  

As a result of the closing of the Transfer Agreement, the Company now has no or nominal operations and no or nominal assets and is therefore considered to be a  Shell Company  as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.

Forward-Looking Statements   

This document contains  forward-looking statements.  All statements other than statements of historical fact are  forward-looking statements  for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objections of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements or belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.  

Forward-looking statements may include the words  may,   could,   estimate,   intend,   continue,   believe,   expect  or  anticipate  or other similar words. These forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. We do not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the dates they are made. You should, however, consult further disclosures we make in future filings of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.  

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties. The factors affecting these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:

Overview of Current Operations   

On October 18, 2016 the Company completed the closing of the   Transfer Agreement for the sale and transfer of the Company s 51% interest in All American Golf Center, Inc. ( AAGC ), which constituted substantially all of the Company s assets. As a result of the closing of the Transfer Agreement, the Company now has no or nominal operations and no or nominal assets and is therefore considered to be a  Shell Company  as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act   of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )  .  

At this time, our purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of a corporation whose securities are registered pursuant to the Exchange Act.  We will not restrict our search to any specific business or geographical location.  

This discussion of our proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities.

Management anticipates that we may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because we have nominal assets and limited financial resources. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to our shareholders because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.  

We may seek a business opportunity with entities that have recently commenced operations, or that wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.  

The Company has not entered into any definitive or binding agreements and there are no assurances that such transactions will occur.  Such a combination would normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange.  The Company may determine to structure any business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  

It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such business combination would be issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of its transaction, the Company may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after the Company has entered into an agreement for a business combination or has consummated a business combination. The issuance of additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market in the Company's securities may depress the market value of the Company's securities in the future.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The following table summarizes our current assets, liabilities, and working capital at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.  

16 

Internal and External Sources of Liquidity     

Cash Flow   . Since inception, we have primarily financed our cash flow requirements through related party debt transactions.  If that source of funding is eliminated it may have a material, adverse effect on our operations. We are currently operating at a loss but with positive cash flow because of deferring related party payables and interest payments.  Though this has allowed us to currently minimize the deferral of our payables, we continue to depend on this source of financing. Should we lose our ability to defer those payables, without a return to profitability, our cash resources will be limited.   

Going Concern     

The financial statements included in this filing have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles that contemplate the continuance of the Company as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue existence.   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    

Stock-based Compensation:     In accordance with accounting standards concerning Stock-based Compensation, the Company accounts for all compensation related to stock, options or warrants using a fair value based method in which compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period.  Stock issued for   

17

compensation is valued on the date of the related agreement and using the market price of the stock.  

Related party transactions:      In accordance with accounting standards concerning related party transactions, there now are established requirements for related party disclosures and the policy provides guidance for the disclosures of transactions between related parties.  

Recent Accounting Developments    

The Company believes there is no additional new accounting guidance adopted but not yet effective that are relevant to the readers of our financial statements.
