1.  ORGANIZATION 
    
  The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted according to such rules and regulations. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in Hines Global REIT, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments and eliminations, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly and in conformity with GAAP the financial position of Hines Global REIT, Inc. as of   September 30, 2016  , the results of operations for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been included.  The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. 
    
  Hines Global REIT, Inc. (the  Company ), was formed as a Maryland corporation on December 10, 2008 under the General Corporation Law of the state of Maryland for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in and owning commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments. The Company conducts most of its operations through Hines Global REIT Properties, LP (the  Operating Partnership ) and subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Company operates in a manner to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes. The business of the Company is managed by Hines Global REIT Advisors LP (the  Advisor ), an affiliate of Hines Interests Limited Partnership ( Hines ), pursuant to the Advisory Agreement between the Company, the Advisor and the Operating Partnership (the  Advisory Agreement ). 
    
  The Company raised the equity capital for its real estate investments through   two   public offerings from   August 5, 2009   through   April 11, 2014  .  The Company continues to offer up to   $500.0 million   of shares of its common stock under its distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to an offering which commenced on   April 24, 2014   (the  DRP Offering ).  The Company has raised gross offering proceeds of approximately   $3.0 billion   through its public offerings, including the DRP Offering, all of which have been invested in the Company s real estate portfolio. 
    
  In March 2015, the Company completed its investment of the proceeds raised through its public offerings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned interests in   42   real estate investments, consisting of the following types of investments: 

Domestic office investments (  11   investments) 
                
    Domestic other investments (  9   investments) 
                
    International office investments (  10   investments) 
                
    International other investments (  12   investments) 
       
  Discussed below are additional details related to the Company s investments in real estate-related debt as of   September 30, 2016  .  Each of these investments is included in the Company s domestic other investments segment.  All other investments are operating real estate investments. 

Flagship Capital JV     97%   interest in a joint venture with Flagship Capital GP, which was formed to provide real estate loans. The joint venture has   two   loans receivable, totaling   $15.1 million  , outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company is not affiliated with Flagship Capital GP.  See Note 5   Real Estate Loans Receivable for additional information regarding these loans receivable. 

The Rim Loan Receivable   the Company committed to provide construction financing to the developer of additional retail parcels at The Rim, an outdoor retail center located in San Antonio, Texas.  In April 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the first of these additional parcels, consisting of   259,316   square feet.  In December 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of an additional parcel, consisting of   28,901   square feet.  The total amount of the commitment, as amended in April and December 2015, is   $20.8 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding loans of   $17.9 million   to the developer.  The Company is not affiliated with the developer of the project.

Consolidated VIEs 
    
  The WaterWall Place JV, Aviva Coral Gables JV, and Flagship Capital JV were each determined to be variable interest entities ( VIE ) in which the Company is the primary beneficiary and the Company has consolidated these joint ventures accordingly.  A summary of the assets and liabilities of these consolidated VIEs, as well as the maximum loss exposure of the Company from these consolidated VIEs, is as follows (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Represents the Company's contributions, net of distributions, made to the consolidated VIEs.    
       
  Restrictions on the use of a VIE s assets are significant because they serve as collateral for such VIE s debt, and the Company is generally required to obtain its partners  approval in accordance with the respective joint venture agreements for any major transactions.  Transactions with these joint ventures on the Company s consolidated financial statements primarily relate to (i) contributions for the funding of loans receivable or distributions related to the receipt of proceeds from the collection of loans receivable at the Flagship JV or (ii) operating distributions received from the WaterWall Place JV and the Aviva Coral Gables JV, respectively.  The Company and its partners are subject to the provisions of the joint venture agreements for the VIEs, which include provisions for when additional contributions may be required.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company received distributions of   $20.4 million  , net of capital contributions of   $0.1 million   in accordance with the Company s respective joint venture agreements.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company   made   capital contributions of   $6.0 million  , net of received distributions of   $11.5 million   in accordance with the Company s respective joint venture agreements.  This activity is eliminated in consolidation of the VIEs, but increases, or decreases in the case of distributions received, the Company s maximum risk of loss. 
    
  Unconsolidated VIEs 
    
  The Rim Loan Receivable 
    
  In February 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of The Rim, an outdoor retail center located in San Antonio, Texas. In August 2014, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Central Rim LLC (the  Rim Borrower ), as amended in April 2015 and December 2015, to provide   $20.8 million   of construction financing at The Rim.  In April 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of an additional   259,316   square feet of retail space at The Rim. In December 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of an additional parcel, consisting of   28,901   square feet.   Following the completion of the development of each parcel, the Company will have certain rights or obligations to purchase each parcel. As a result of these purchase rights or obligations, and due to the fact that the Rim Borrower lacks the obligation to absorb losses upon the achievement of certain metrics, the Company has determined that the entity that owns these parcels is considered to be a VIE.  Additionally, the Rim Borrower was determined to be the primary beneficiary of this VIE since it is the party most directly responsible for the success of the entity.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had loans of   $17.9 million   outstanding to the developer.    The Company's maximum exposure to loss is the amount borrowed under the facility agreement, plus any unpaid interest.    The most significant source of the Company's exposure to the VIE is the variability related to the Rim Borrower's credit risk and its ability to repay the amounts funded. 
    
  The @1377 Equity Method Investment 
    
    The Company formed a joint venture with an affiliate of Hines in 2011 related to the construction of @1377, a multi-family development project in Atlanta, Georgia. The Company provided a preferred equity investment in the partnership of   $3.6 million   during 2012, representing a   51.7%   ownership in the project and a   $3.2 million   mezzanine loan commitment plus accrued interest made by the Company. In addition, the partnership obtained a   $23.3 million   secured loan from Cadence Bank, N.A., which is solely guaranteed by the Company s joint venture partner (the  JV Partner ). The Company has concluded that @1377 qualifies as a VIE. The JV Partner was the manager of the project, which allowed the JV Partner to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s financial performance. Based upon the loan guarantees and the JV Partner s ability to direct the activities that significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, the Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of this VIE and determined to account for its preferred equity investment in the project as an equity method investment. Other than the initial capital contributions provided by the Company, the Company did not provide any additional subordinated financial support.

     Table of Contents  

The construction of @1377 was completed in   March 2014   and in June 2016, the partnership sold @1377 for   $51.0 million  , excluding transaction costs and closing prorations.  As a result of the sale of the property, the Company s equity in earnings of the partnership included a gain of   $7.5 million   and the Company received distributions of   $8.7 million   as well as   $4.0 million   related to the repayment of its mezzanine loan.

The table below summarizes the Company s maximum loss exposure related to its unconsolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , (in thousands) which is equal to the carrying value of its investment in the unconsolidated VIEs included in the balance sheet line item  Investment in unconsolidated entities  and the Company s outstanding loan receivable balances of   $17.9 million   and   $16.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, held by the VIEs which is included in the balance sheet line item  Real estate loans receivable  in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Described below are certain of the Company s significant accounting policies. The disclosures regarding several of the policies have been condensed or omitted in accordance with interim reporting regulations specified by Form 10-Q. Please see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a complete listing of all of its significant accounting policies. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the accounts of Hines Global REIT, Inc., the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as the related amounts of noncontrolling interests.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02, the Company has determined that the Operating Partnership is considered a VIE.  However, the Company meets the disclosure exemption criteria under ASU 2015-02, as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and the Company s partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  
    
  The Company has retroactively changed, for all prior periods presented, its classification of distributions in its consolidated balance sheets and statements of equity by reflecting such distributions as charges against  accumulated distributions in excess of earnings.   This presentation change had no impact on the total equity balances in any of the periods presented.

Tenant and Other Receivables 
    
  Tenant and other receivables are shown at cost in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of   $2.0 million   and   $1.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Deferred Financing Costs 
    
  Deferred financing costs consist of direct costs incurred in obtaining debt financing (see Note 6   Debt Financing).  These fees are presented as a reduction to the related debt liability for permanent mortgages and as an asset for revolving credit arrangements.  In total, deferred financing costs (net of amortization) were   $12.2 million   and   $15.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  These costs are amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the terms of the obligations.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   $1.2 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, were amortized into interest expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   $3.8 million   and   $4.7 million  , respectively, were amortized into interest expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
    
  Other Assets 
    
  Other assets included the following (in thousands): 

Revenue Recognition 
    
  Rental payments are generally paid by the tenants prior to the beginning of each month or quarter to which they relate.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, the Company recorded liabilities of   $29.3 million   and   $33.4 million   related to prepaid rental payments, which were included in other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease, including rent holidays, if any. Straight-line rent receivable was   $88.3 million   and   $72.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Straight-line rent receivable consists of the difference between the tenants  rents calculated on a straight-line basis from the date of acquisition or lease commencement over the remaining terms of the related leases and the tenants  actual rents due under the lease agreements and is included in tenant and other receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Revenues associated with operating expense recoveries are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred based upon the tenant lease provisions. Revenues relating to lease termination fees are recognized on a straight-line basis amortized from the time that a tenant s right to occupy the leased space is modified through the end of the revised lease term. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance that eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.  Pursuant to the new guidance, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment.  This new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption was permitted.  The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires the impairment of financial instruments to be based on expected credit losses.  These amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in the ASU are effective for public entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities for annual

periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements.

9.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  Financial Instruments Fair Value Disclosures 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimated that the fair value of its notes payable, which had a book value of   $2.5 billion  , was   $2.5 billion  . As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company estimated that the fair value of its notes payable, which had a book value of   $2.6 billion  , was   $2.6 billion  . Management has utilized market information as available or present value techniques to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed. Although the Company has determined the majority of the inputs used to value its notes payable fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit quality adjustments associated with its fair value of notes payable utilize Level 3 inputs. However, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit quality adjustments on the overall valuations of its fair market value of notes payable and has determined that they are not significant. As a result, the Company has determined these financial instruments utilize Level 2 inputs. Since such amounts are estimates that are based on limited available market information for similar transactions, there can be no assurance that the disclosed values could be realized. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimated that the book values of its real estate loans receivable approximate their fair values.  Although the Company has determined the majority of the inputs used to value its real estate notes receivable fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit quality adjustments associated with its fair value of real estate notes receivable utilize Level 3 inputs. However, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit quality adjustments on the overall valuations of its fair market value of real estate notes receivable and has determined that they are not significant. As a result, the Company has determined these financial instruments utilize Level 2 inputs. Since such amounts are estimates that are based on limited available market information for similar transactions, there can be no assurance that the disclosed values could be realized. 
    
  Other financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, distributions receivable, tenant and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other liabilities, due to affiliates and distributions payable.  The carrying value of these items reasonably approximates their fair value based on their highly-liquid nature and/or short-term maturities. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. 
    
  Financial Instruments Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis 
    
  Certain long-lived assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments (i.e., impairments) in certain circumstances. The inputs associated with the valuation of long-lived assets are generally included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , there were no events that have occurred which indicated that fair value adjustments of the Company s long-lived assets were necessary. 

10. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
    
  The Company s investments in real estate are geographically diversified and management evaluates the operating performance of each at an individual investment level and considers each investment to be an operating segment. The Company has aggregated all of its operating segments into   four   reportable segments based on the location of the segment and the underlying asset class.  Management has aggregated the Company's investments that are not office properties in  other  based on the geographic location of the investment, due to the Company's ownership of interests in various different types of investments that do not stand alone as their own reportable segment.  The Company s reporting segments consist of the following, based on the Company s investments as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Domestic office investments (  11   investments) 
                
    Domestic other investments (  9   investments)

  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as amended. Such statements include statements concerning future financial performance and distributions, future debt and financing levels, acquisitions and investment objectives, payments to Hines Global REIT Advisors Limited Partnership (the  Advisor ), and its affiliates and other plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto as well as all other statements that are not historical statements. These statements are only predictions. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees. Actual events or our investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as  may,   should,   expect,   could,   intend,   plan,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,   predict,   potential  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. 
    
  The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, the availability of future financing and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Any of the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements could prove to be inaccurate. To the extent that our assumptions differ from actual results, our ability to meet such forward-looking statements, including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, pay distributions to our shareholders and maintain the value of any real estate investments and real estate-related investments in which we may hold an interest in the future, may be significantly hindered.

     Table of Contents  

The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in certain forward-looking statements:                   

Whether we will have the opportunity to invest debt proceeds and proceeds from the sale of assets to acquire properties or other investments or whether such proceeds will be needed to redeem shares or for other purposes, and if proceeds are available for investment, our ability to make such investments in a timely manner and at appropriate amounts that provide acceptable returns; 

Competition for tenants and real estate investment opportunities, including competition with affiliates of Hines Interests Limited Partnership ( Hines  

Our reliance on our Advisor, Hines and affiliates of Hines for our day-to-day operations and the selection of real estate investments, and our Advisor s ability to attract and retain high-quality personnel who can provide service at a level acceptable to us; 

Risks associated with conflicts of interests that result from our relationship with our Advisor and Hines, as well as conflicts of interests certain of our officers and directors face relating to the positions they hold with other entities; 

The potential need to fund tenant improvements, lease-up costs or other capital expenditures, as well as increases in property operating expenses and costs of compliance with environmental matters or discovery of previously undetected environmentally hazardous or other undetected adverse conditions at our properties; 

The availability and timing of distributions we may pay is uncertain and cannot be assured; 

Our distributions have been paid using cash flows from financing activities, including proceeds from our public offerings, proceeds from debt financings and cash from the waiver of fees, and some or all of the distributions we pay in the future may be paid from similar sources or sources such as cash advances by our Advisor or cash resulting from a deferral or waiver of fees. When we pay distributions from certain sources other than our cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for the acquisition of properties, and your overall return may be reduced; 

Risks associated with debt and our ability to secure financing; 

Risks associated with adverse changes in general economic or local market conditions, including terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, which may affect the markets in which we and our tenants operate; 

Catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and terrorist attacks; and our ability to secure adequate insurance at reasonable and appropriate rates; 

The failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could reduce the amount of cash we have available to pay distributions and make additional investments; 

Changes in governmental, tax, real estate and zoning laws and regulations and the related costs of compliance and increases in our administrative operating expenses, including expenses associated with operating as a public company; 

International investment risks, including the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and the uncertainty of such laws, the tax treatment of transaction structures, political and economic instability, foreign currency fluctuations, and inflation and governmental measures to curb inflation may adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions; 

The lack of liquidity associated with our assets; and 

Our ability to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes. 

Risks related to the result of the non-binding referendum of June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted in favor of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (the "Brexit" vote), including, but not limited to the decline of revenue derived from, and the market value of, properties located in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. 

Our ability to refinance or sell properties located in the United Kingdom and continental Europe may be impacted by the economic and political uncertainty following the "Brexit" vote. 

These risks are more fully discussed in, and all forward-looking statements should be read in light of, all of the factors discussed in  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Executive Summary 
    
  Hines Global REIT, Inc. ( Hines Global  and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries,  we ,  us  or the  Company ) was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on December 10, 2008, primarily for the purpose of investing in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments located throughout the United States and internationally.  Hines Global raised the equity capital for its real estate investments through two public offerings from August 2009 through April 2014.  Hines Global continues to offer up to   $500.0 million   of shares of its common stock under its distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to an offering which commenced on   April 24, 2014   (the  DRP Offering ). Hines Global has raised approximately   $3.0 billion   through its public offerings, including the DRP Offering.  Hines Global engaged Hines Securities, Inc. (the  Dealer Manager ), an affiliate of Hines, to serve as the dealer manager for its public offerings.  
    
  Although we expect to continue to make select investments from time to time, we have substantially completed our investment phase and have accomplished one of our primary investment objectives of investing in a real estate portfolio that is diversified by asset type, geographic area, lease expirations and tenant industries.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned interests in   42   real estate investments which contain, in the aggregate,   16.7 million   square feet of leasable space.  Our portfolio includes the following investments: 

Domestic office investments (  11   investments) 
                
    Domestic other investments (  9   investments) 
                
    International office investments (  10   investments) 
                
    International other investments (  12   investments) 
       
  Our portfolio is comprised of approximately     63%   domestic and     37%   international investments (based on our pro rata share of the estimated value of each of the investments) and consists of a variety of real estate asset classes.  Our current investment types encompass approximately   62%   office,   17%   retail,   9%   mixed-use,   9%   industrial and   3%   multi-family (based on our effective interests of the estimated value of each of the investments).  We believe that this diversification is directly in-line with our investment strategies of maintaining a well-diversified real estate portfolio and providing additional diversification across currencies. 
    
  As previously disclosed, we commenced the process of evaluating various strategic alternatives to execute a liquidity event (e.g. a sale of our assets, our sale or merger, a listing of our shares on a national securities exchange, a tender offer for our shares, or another similar transaction).  That process is ongoing, and we are continuing to evaluate strategic alternatives.  There is no set timetable for the execution of such an event, and there is no assurance that any such event will occur. 
    
  The following table provides additional information regarding each of the properties in which we owned an interest as of   September 30, 2016  .

    Represents the percentage leased based on the effective ownership of the Operating Partnership in the properties listed. On   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned a   99.99%   interest in the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner. Affiliates of Hines owned the remaining   0.01%   interest in the Operating Partnership. We own a 60% interest in the Brindleyplace Project. 
       
           (2) 
    For acquisitions denominated in a foreign currency, amounts have been translated to U.S. dollars at a rate based on the exchange rate in effect on the acquisition date. 
       
           (3) 
    The estimated going-in capitalization rate is determined as of the date of acquisition by dividing the projected property revenues in excess of expenses for the first fiscal year following the date of acquisition by the net purchase price (excluding closing costs and taxes). Property revenues in excess of expenses includes all projected operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, parking and any other property-related income) less all projected operating expenses (property operating and maintenance expenses, property taxes, insurance and property management fees).  
     
   24 

     Table of Contents  

The projected property revenues in excess of expenses includes assumptions which may not be indicative of the actual future performance of the property, and the actual economic performance of each property for our period of ownership may differ materially from the amounts used in calculating the estimated going-in capitalization rate. These include assumptions, with respect to each property, that in-place tenants will continue to perform under their lease agreements during the 12 months following our acquisition of the property.  In addition, with respect to the Brindleyplace Project, Hock Plaza, Southpark, Fifty South Sixth, Komo Plaza, the Poland Logistics Portfolio, the Minneapolis Retail Center, 465 Victoria, One Westferry Circus, Riverside Center, 825 Ann, the Campus at Playa Vista, The Markets at Town Center, the Avenue at Murfreesboro, 55 M Street, 818 Bourke and The Summit, the projected property revenues in excess of expenses include assumptions concerning estimates of timing and rental rates related to re-leasing vacant space. 
    
           (4) 
    The Domestic Other Investments presented in the table excludes the Flagship Capital JV.  This investment is described in more detail below under  Other Real Estate Investments.  
       
           (5) 
    Construction has been completed for these multi-family development properties. The estimated going-in capitalization rate is based on the projected revenues in excess of expenses once the property s operations have stabilized divided by the construction cost of the property. The projected property revenues in excess of expenses includes assumptions which may not be indicative of the actual future performance of the property, and the actual economic performance of the property for our period of ownership may differ materially from the amounts used in calculating the estimated going-in capitalization rate. These include assumptions concerning estimates of timing and rental rates related to leasing vacant space and assumptions that in-place tenants will continue to perform under their lease agreements during the 12 months following stabilization of the property.

The Rim Loan Receivable   We have committed to provide construction financing to the developer of additional retail parcels at The Rim, an outdoor retail center located in San Antonio, Texas.  In April 2015, we completed the acquisition of the first of these additional parcels, consisting of   259,316   square feet.  In December 2015, we completed the acquisition of an additional parcel, consisting of   28,901   square feet.  The total amount of the commitment, as amended in April and December 2015, is   $20.8 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding loans of   $17.9 million   to the developer.  We are not affiliated with the developer of the project.  

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Each of our critical accounting policies involves the use of estimates that require management to make assumptions that are subjective in nature. Management relies on its experience, collects historical and current market data, and analyzes these assumptions in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates. In addition, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments regarding assumptions as to future uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. A disclosure of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies during   2016  .

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  To date, our most significant demands for funds have been related to the purchase of real estate properties and other real estate-related investments. Specifically, we funded   $5.1 billion   of real estate investments using   $3.0 billion   of proceeds from our public offerings, including the DRP offerings, and debt proceeds.  We invested all of the proceeds raised through our public offerings by the end of 2015.  As a result, any subsequent real estate investments will be funded using proceeds from the dispositions of other real estate investments and debt proceeds.  Other significant demands for funds include the payment of operating expenses, distributions and debt service. Generally, we expect to meet these operating cash needs using cash flows from operating activities.  
    
  We have not generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions paid. Therefore some or all of our distributions may continue to be paid from other sources, such as proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan, proceeds from the sales of assets, cash advances by our Advisor, and cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees.  We have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from any of these other sources. 
    
  We believe that the proper use of leverage can enhance returns on real estate investments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio was   45%   leveraged, based on the values of our real estate investments.  At that time, we had   $2.5 billion   of principal outstanding under our various loan agreements with a weighted average interest rate of   2.3%  , including the effects of related interest rate swaps. Approximately   $250.7 million   of our loans are maturing during the next year.  We generally expect to refinance these loans, but we may repay them using our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) or other available cash for strategic purposes or if we are unable to refinance them at satisfactory terms. 
    
  The discussions below provide additional details regarding our cash flows. 
    
   Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Our real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, which are used to pay direct leasing costs, property-level operating expenses and interest payments. Property-level operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages of property management personnel, utilities, cleaning, insurance, security and building maintenance costs, property management and leasing fees, and property taxes. Additionally, we incur general and administrative expenses, acquisition fees and expenses and asset management fees.  
    
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $123.2 million   compared to   $93.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by the payment of acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses totaling   $0.7 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $19.8 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses are expensed and therefore reduce cash flows from operating activities.  However, we funded these expenses with proceeds from our public offerings or other equity capital.  Excluding the effect of these fees and expenses, operating cash flows increased by   $10.2 million   primarily due to our acquisitions of The Summit, the Harder Logistics Portfolio, and additional phases of The Rim, the Aviva Coral Gables development project being fully operational during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and distributions from the sale of @1377, by our unconsolidated joint venture.  This increase was partially offset by our disposition of 17600 Gillette in December 2015 as well as declines in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to payments made for the acquisition of our real estate investments including payments for pending acquisitions and capital expenditures at our properties.  Net cash from investing activities primarily relates to collections of our real estate loans receivable.  Net cash used in investing activities decreased   $443.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to less acquisition activity.  The factors that contributed to the change between the two periods are summarized below. 
    
  2016 

We paid   $13.0 million   in capital expenditures at our operating properties.   
                
    We made real estate loans of   $5.9 million   and received proceeds from the collection of real estate loans receivable of   $28.8 million  . 
                
    We received distributions in excess of equity of earnings from our unconsolidated entity of   $2.0 million  , resulting from the sale of @1377. 
                
    We had an increase in restricted cash of   $1.4 million   primarily related to escrows required by several of our outstanding mortgage loans.  
       
  2015 

We had cash outflows of   $431.2 million   related to our acquisition of four real estate investments. 
                
    We paid   $3.6 million   in capital expenditures at our operating properties and paid   $4.9 million   in capital expenditures at our multi-family development projects in Houston, Texas and Miami, Florida.   
                
    We made real estate loans of   $10.3 million   and received proceeds from the collection of real estate loans receivable of   $17.6 million  .   
                
    We had an increase in restricted cash of   $1.7 million   primarily related to escrows required by several of our outstanding mortgage loans.  
       
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Public Offerings 
    
  As described previously, we ceased offering primary shares pursuant to our public offerings in April 2014.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, we redeemed   $50.6 million   and   $43.0 million   in shares of our common stock through our share redemption program. 
    
  Distributions 
    
  We have declared distributions for the months of January 2015 through   November 2016   at an amount equal to   $0.0017808   per share, per day.  Distributions are paid monthly on the first business day following the completion of each month to which they relate. All distributions were or will be paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock for those participating in our distribution reinvestment plan.  Distributions paid to stockholders (including those reinvested in stock) during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $45.2 million   and   $44.7 million  , respectively.  Distributions paid to stockholders (including those reinvested in stock) during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $134.8 million   and   $132.7 million  , respectively.  
    
  Our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be insufficient to fully fund distributions paid to stockholders.  We funded   12%   and   33%   of total distributions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, with cash flows from financing activities, which may include proceeds from our public offerings and proceeds from our debt financings.  Also, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, we paid   $0.7 million   and   $19.8 million   in acquisition fees and expenses.  Under GAAP, acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses are expensed and therefore reduce cash flows from operating activities.  However, we funded these expenses with proceeds from our public offerings or other equity capital.  See    Results of Operations   Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations  for additional information regarding our performance.

Debt Financings 
    
  We utilize permanent mortgage financing to leverage returns on our real estate investments and use borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility to provide funding for near-term investment or working capital needs.  As mentioned previously, our portfolio was   45%   leveraged as of   September 30, 2016   (based on the values of our real estate investments) with a weighted average interest rate of   2.3%  .  
    
  Below is additional information regarding our loan activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  See Note 6   Debt Financing for additional information regarding our outstanding debt:  
    
  2016 

We borrowed approximately   $109.0 million   and made payments of   $114.0 million   under our Revolving Credit Facility.   
                
    The Flagship JV made payments of   $14.4 million   on its revolving credit facility. 
                
    We made payments of   $7.3 million   related to our loan secured by New City, including a one-time payment of $  5.8 million   in July 2016.    
                
    We made payments of   $3.7 million   on our remaining outstanding mortgage loans. 
       
  2015 

We entered into   $221.6 million   of mortgage financing, related to the acquisition of operating properties with an aggregate net purchase price of   $463.4 million  .  Additionally, our multi-family development projects borrowed   $5.1 million   to fund construction costs.   
                
    We borrowed approximately   $1.1 billion   and made payments of   $824.7 million   under our Revolving Credit Facility.   
                
    We also made payments totaling   $51.9 million   on our remaining outstanding mortgage loans. 
                
    We made payments of   $7.6 million   for financing costs related to our loans and   $2.3 million   related to   two     $250 million   interest rate cap corridor agreements as economic hedges against the variability of future interest rates on our Revolving Credit Facility.

Other Expenses 
    
  The tables below provide detail relating to our asset management and acquisition fees, acquisition-related expenses, and general and administrative expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  All amounts in thousands, except percentages: 

The changes identified in the table above are primarily due to the following:

The changes identified in the table above are primarily due to the following: 

The decrease in acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses is due to there being no acquisition activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
                
    Asset management fees were higher for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to our acquisition of additional real estate investments in 2015.  
                
    The increase in our general and administrative costs is primarily due to an increase in legal expenses, consulting expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses of   $2.5 million   incurred related to our consideration of strategic alternatives for a potential liquidity event. 
       
  Foreign Currency Gains (Losses) 
    
  Our international real estate investments use functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date while income statement amounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Gains or losses resulting from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders  equity. By contrast, gains and losses related to transactions denominated in currencies other than an entity s functional currency are recorded in foreign currency gains (losses) on the consolidated statement of operations. An exception is made where an intercompany loan or advance is deemed to be of a long-term investment nature, in which instance foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders  equity.

     Table of Contents  

During the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , these gain/losses were primarily related to the effect of remeasuring our borrowings denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies and the changes to the related exchange rates between the date of the borrowing and the end of each period. 
    
  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
    
  Funds from Operations ( FFO ) is a non-GAAP financial performance measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) widely recognized by investors and analysts as one measure of operating performance of a real estate company. FFO excludes items such as real estate depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization, as applied in accordance with GAAP, implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and also assumes that such assets are adequately maintained and renovated as required in order to maintain their value. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions such as occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, it is management s view, and we believe the view of many industry investors and analysts, that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone is insufficient. In addition, FFO excludes gains and losses from the sale of real estate and impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets and in-substance real estate equity investments, which we believe provides management and investors with a helpful additional measure of the historical performance of our real estate portfolio, as it allows for comparisons, year to year, that reflect the impact on operations from trends in items such as occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs. A property will be evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the property). Undiscounted future cash flows are based on anticipated operating performance, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, stockholders are cautioned that due to the limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.  
    
  In addition to FFO, management uses Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO ), as defined by the Investment Program Association (the  IPA ), as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate our operating performance. The IPA has recommended the use of MFFO as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs to enhance the assessment of the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be useful as a measure of the long-term operating performance of our investments or as a comparative measure to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended and described herein. MFFO includes funds generated by the operations of our real estate investments and funds used in our corporate-level operations. MFFO is based on FFO, but includes certain additional adjustments which we believe are appropriate. Such items include reversing the effects of straight-line rent revenue recognition, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and certain other items as described below. Some of these adjustments are necessary to address changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP such as the accounting for acquisition-related expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP rules for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO. These changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP affected all industries, and as a result of these changes, acquisition fees and expenses are typically accounted for as operating expenses under GAAP. Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. These changes also have prompted a significant increase in the magnitude of non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO, as defined. Such items include amortization of out-of-market lease intangible assets and liabilities and certain tenant incentives.  
    
  Other adjustments included in MFFO are necessary to address issues that are common to publicly registered, non-listed REITs. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operations. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs like us are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.  
    
  The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, including acquisition fees and expenses, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to our stockholders. MFFO excludes acquisition fees payable to our Advisor and acquisition expenses. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to our stockholders. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses with respect to the acquisition of a property negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which the property is acquired and will have negative effects on returns to our stockholders, the potential for future distributions, and future cash flows, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, the related acquisition fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In addition, now that all offering proceeds from our public offerings have been invested, if we acquire a property, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to the Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired. Since MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses, MFFO would only be comparable to the operations of non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics.  
    
  Management uses MFFO to evaluate the financial performance of our investment portfolio, including the impact of potential future investments. In addition, management uses MFFO to evaluate and establish our distribution policy and the sustainability thereof. Further, we believe MFFO is one of several measures that may be useful to investors in evaluating the potential performance of our portfolio following the conclusion of the acquisition phase, as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses, as described herein. 
    
  MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.  
    
  FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO and MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO and MFFO are not intended to be used as liquidity measures indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Please see the limitations listed below associated with the use of MFFO:  

As we are approaching the end of the acquisition phase of our life cycle, acquisition costs and other adjustments that are increases to MFFO are, and may continue to be, a significant use of cash and dilutive to the value of an investment in our shares. 

MFFO excludes acquisition fees payable to our Advisor and acquisition expenses. Although these amounts reduce net income, we generally have funded such costs with proceeds from our public offerings and acquisition-related indebtedness (and, solely with respect to acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of the Brindleyplace Project in July 2010, equity capital contributions from our joint venture partner) and do not consider these fees and expenses in the evaluation of our operating performance and determining MFFO. 

We use interest rate swap contracts and interest rate caps as economic hedges against the variability of interest rates on variable-rate loans. Although we expect to hold these instruments to maturity, if we were to settle these instruments currently, it would have an impact on our operating performance.  Additionally, these derivative instruments are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP.  MFFO excludes gains (losses) related to changes in these estimated values of our derivative instruments because such adjustments may not be reflective of ongoing operations and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. 

We use foreign currency forward contracts as economic hedges against the variability of foreign exchange rates on certain international investments. These derivative instruments are typically short-term and are frequently settled at amounts that result in additional amounts paid or received. However, such gains (losses) are excluded from MFFO since they are not considered to be operational in nature.  Additionally, these derivative instruments are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP.  MFFO excludes gains (losses) related to changes in these estimated values of our derivative instruments because such adjustments may not be reflective of ongoing operations or may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. 

We utilize the definition of FFO as set forth by NAREIT and the definition of MFFO as set forth by the IPA. Our FFO and MFFO as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs, if they use different approaches. 

Our business is subject to volatility in the real estate markets and general economic conditions, and adverse changes in those conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and MFFO. Accordingly, the predictive nature of MFFO is uncertain and past performance may not be indicative of future results.  
       
  Neither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), NAREIT nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.

     Table of Contents  

The following section presents our calculation of FFO and MFFO attributable to common stockholders and provides additional information related to our operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the period from inception (December 10, 2008) through   September 30, 2016  . As we have recently completed the acquisition phase of our life cycle, FFO and MFFO are not useful in comparing operations for the two periods presented below.  

Notes to the table: 
    
           (1) 
    Represents the depreciation and amortization of various real estate assets.  Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that such depreciation and amortization may be of limited relevance in evaluating current operating performance and, as such, these items are excluded from our determination of FFO. 
       
           (2) 
    Represents the loss (gain) on disposition of certain real estate investments that were sold in 2014 and 2015.  Although this loss (gain) is included in the calculation of net income (loss), we have excluded it from FFO because we believe doing so appropriately presents the operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. 
       
           (3) 
    Includes income attributable to noncontrolling interests and all adjustments to eliminate the noncontrolling interests  share of the adjustments to convert our net loss to FFO and MFFO. 
       
           (4) 
    Represents components of net loss related to the estimated changes in the values of our interest rate contract derivatives and foreign currency forwards.  We have excluded these changes in value from our evaluation of our operating performance and MFFO because such adjustments may not be reflective of our ongoing performance and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. 
       
           (5) 
    Represents components of net loss primarily resulting from the remeasurement of loans denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. We have excluded these changes in value from our evaluation of our operating performance and MFFO because such adjustments may not be reflective of our ongoing performance and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. 

35 

     Table of Contents  

(6) 
    Includes the following components of revenues and expenses that we do not consider in evaluating our operating performance and determining MFFO for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

(a) 
    Represents the adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms.  We have excluded these adjustments from our evaluation of our operating performance and in determining MFFO because we believe that the rent that is billable during the current period is a more relevant measure of our operating performance for such period. 
       
           (b) 
    Represents the amortization of lease incentives and out-of-market leases. 
       
           (7) 
    Represents acquisition expenses and acquisition fees paid to our Advisor that are expensed in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. We fund such costs with proceeds from our offering, and therefore do not consider these expenses in evaluating our operating performance and determining MFFO. 
       
  As noted previously, our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be insufficient to fully fund distributions paid. Therefore, some or all of our distributions may continue to be paid from other sources, such as cash advances by the Advisor, cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees, borrowings and/or proceeds from the DRP Offering.  We have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from any of these sources.  
    
  From inception through   September 30, 2016  , we declared distributions to our stockholders totaling   $737.7 million  , compared to total aggregate FFO of   $519.1 million   and cash flows from operating activities of   $467.2 million  .  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we declared distributions to our stockholders totaling   $44.8 million  , compared to total aggregate FFO of   $48.3 million  .  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we declared distributions to our stockholders totaling $  45.2 million  , compared to total aggregate FFO of   $55.0 million  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we declared distributions to our stockholders totaling   $132.4 million  , compared to total aggregate FFO of   $122.9 million  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we declared distributions to our stockholders totaling   $134.4 million  , compared to total aggregate FFO of   $149.8 million  .  During our offering and investment stages, we incur acquisition fees and expenses in connection with our real estate investments, which are recorded as reductions to net income (loss) and FFO. From inception through   September 30, 2016  , we incurred acquisition fees and expenses totaling   $222.7 million  . 

Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
    
  We have entered into agreements with the Advisor, Dealer Manager and Hines or its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees and reimbursements to these entities during the various phases of our organization and operation. During the organization and offering stage, these include payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions and the dealer manager fee and payments to our Advisor for reimbursement of issuer costs. During the acquisition and operational stages, these include payments for certain services related to acquisitions, financing and management of our investments and operations provided to us by our Advisor and Hines and its affiliates pursuant to various agreements we have entered into or anticipate entering into with these entities. See Note 8   Related Party Transactions in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for additional information concerning our related-party transactions. 
    
  The @1377 partnership agreement provided that, subject to the achievement of certain return thresholds, Hines would receive certain incentive distributions.  In connection with the sale of @1377, Hines received total distributions of   $15.7 million   from the @1377 partnership in June 2016, which included a return of capital, preferred return distributions, and incentive distributions based on the achievement of the return thresholds set forth in the @1377 partnership agreement.  The total distributions received by Hines represented   58%   of the total distributions from the @1377 partnership.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market-sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we believe that interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and real estate valuation risk are the primary market risks to which we are exposed. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of debt used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. One of our interest rate risk management objectives is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on cash flows. To achieve this objective, we may borrow at fixed rates or fix the variable rates of interest on variable interest rate borrowings through the use of interest rate swaps and caps. We have and may continue to enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to credit risk of the counterparty to these contracts in the event of non-performance under the terms of the derivative contracts.  In the event of non-performance by the counterparty, if we were not able to replace these contracts, we would be subject to the variability of interest rates on the total amount of debt outstanding under the mortgage. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had fixed-rate debt of   $346.0 million   and variable-rate debt of   $2.1 billion  .  If interest rates were to increase by 1% and all other variables were held constant, we would incur   $21.5 million   in additional annual interest expense associated with our variable-rate debt.  Additionally, we hedged approximately   $0.9 billion   of our variable-rate debt using interest rate caps, which limit our exposure to rising interest rates.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the variable interest rates did not exceed their capped interest rates.  
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
    
  We currently have real estate investments located in countries outside of the U.S. that are subject to the effects of exchange rate movements between the foreign currency of each real estate investment and the U.S. dollar, which may affect future costs and cash flows as well as amounts translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our condensed consolidated financial statements.  Generally, we have entered into mortgage loans denominated in foreign currencies for these investments, which provide natural hedges with regard to changes in exchange rates between the foreign currencies and U.S. dollar and reduces our exposure to exchange rate differences.  Additionally, we are typically a net receiver of these foreign currencies, and, as a result, our foreign operations benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar.  The table below identifies the effect that a 10% immediate, unfavorable change in the exchange rates would have on our equity in these international real estate investments and their net income for the most recently completed period, by foreign currency (in thousands)   (1)(2)   :   

(1) 
    Our real estate assets in Moscow, Russia were purchased in U.S. dollars and we expect that when we dispose of these assets, the sale transactions will also be denominated in U.S. dollars.  Accordingly, we do not expect to have economic exposure to the Ruble upon disposition.  However, changes in the exchange rate between the Ruble and the U.S. dollar could result in realized losses recorded in our consolidated statement of operations at the time of sale. 
       
           (2) 
    Our real estate assets in Warsaw, Wroclaw and Upper Silesia, Poland were purchased in Euros and we expect that when we dispose of these assets, the sale transactions will also be denominated in Euros. Accordingly, we do not expect to have Polish zloty exposure upon disposition.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Change in Internal Controls 
    
  No change occurred in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II- OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.     Legal Proceedings 
    
  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company or its subsidiaries may become subject to legal proceedings, claims or disputes. As of   November 14, 2016  , neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries was a party to any material pending legal proceedings. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
    
  We are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , except for the item described below. 
    
  The United Kingdom s non-binding referendum of June 23, 2016 to exit the European Union could adversely affect market rental rates and commercial real estate values in the United Kingdom and Europe. 
    
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a non-binding referendum in which a majority of voters voted in favor of the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union. Negotiations to determine the terms of the United Kingdom s relationship with the European Union after the exit, including, among other things, the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union are expected to commence. The effects of the exit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The Brexit vote may: 

adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions; 
                
    adversely affect commercial property market rental rates in the United Kingdom and continental Europe; 
                
    adversely affect commercial property market values in the United Kingdom and continental Europe; 
                
    adversely affect the availability of financing for commercial properties in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, which could reduce the price for which we are able to sell properties we have acquired in such geographic locations; and 
                
    create further instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the sterling and euro. 
       
  Each of these effects may occur regardless of whether the United Kingdom departs from the European Union because the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption. A decline in economic conditions could negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our portfolio, which could, among other things, adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

Item 2.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not sell or issue any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

     Table of Contents  

All eligible requests for redemption that were received for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were redeemed and the redemptions were funded with proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan. The following table lists shares we redeemed under our share redemption program during the period covered by this report. 

(1) 
    This amount represents the number of shares available for redemption on   September 30, 2016  . Our share redemption program was first announced at the commencement of our initial public offering in February 2009. Our share redemption program does not have a fixed expiration date, but it is subject to significant restrictions and limitations and our board of directors may terminate, suspend or amend the program without stockholder approval. We may redeem shares on a monthly basis if the shares were held for at least one year and meet certain other conditions. Any such redemptions will be limited to the amount required to redeem 5% of the shares outstanding as of the same date in the prior calendar year, and unless our board of directors determines otherwise, redemptions will be further limited to the amount of proceeds received from our distribution reinvestment plan in the month prior to the month in which the redemption request was received. Per the terms of our share redemption program, we may waive the one-year holding requirement and limitations described above for share redemption requests made in connection with the death or disability of a stockholder.

  CERTIFICATION 
  PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF 
  THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
    
  I, Ryan T. Sims, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Hines Global REIT, Inc.; 
       
           2.
