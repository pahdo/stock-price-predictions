      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1. Basis of Presentation 
  The financial information for Viavi Solutions Inc. ( Viavi  also referred to as  the Company ,  we ,  our  and  us ) as of   October 1, 2016   and for the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   is unaudited, and includes all normal and recurring adjustments Company management ( Management ) considers necessary for a fair statement of the financial information set forth herein, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, such information does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements. For further information, please refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   July 2, 2016  . 
  The balance sheet as of   July 2, 2016   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The results for the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   may not be indicative of results for the fiscal year ending   July 1, 2017   or any future periods. 
  Fiscal Years 
  The Company utilizes a   52  -  53   week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to June 30th. The Company s fiscal   2017   is a   52  -week year ending on   July 1, 2017  . The Company s fiscal   2016   was a   53  -week year ending on   July 2, 2016  . The Company s first quarter of fiscal year   2017   was a 13-week quarter. 
  Lumentum Separation 
  On   August 1, 2015   (the  Separation Date ), Viavi completed the distribution of approximately   80.1%   of the outstanding shares of Lumentum Holdings Inc. ( Lumentum ) common stock (the  Distribution ). Concurrent with the Distribution, JDSU was renamed Viavi Solutions Inc. and, at the time of the Distribution, retained ownership of approximately   19.9%   of Lumentum s outstanding shares. Lumentum was formed to hold Viavi s communications and commercial optical products business segment ( CCOP ) and the WaveReady product line and, as a result of the Distribution, is now an independent public company trading under the symbol  LITE  on The Nasdaq Stock Market ( NASDAQ ). The Distribution was made to Viavi s stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 27, 2015 (the  Record Date ), who received   one   share of Lumentum common stock for every   five   shares of Viavi common stock held as of the close of business on the Record Date and not sold prior to August 4, 2015, the ex-dividend date. The historical results of operations and the financial position have been recasted to present the Lumentum business as discontinued operations as described in    Note 3. Discontinued Operations  .  Unless noted otherwise, discussion in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements pertain to continuing operations. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amount of Net revenues and expenses and the disclosure of commitments and contingencies during the reporting periods. The Company bases estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future believed to be reasonable based on available information. The Company s reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to significant accounting policies. If estimates or assumptions differ from actual results, subsequent periods are adjusted to reflect more current information. 
   
  Note 2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance that requires entities to recognize at the transaction date the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  
   6 

Table of Contents  
      VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC. 
      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of financial assets. Under the new guidance, credit losses for certain types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses. The new guidance also modifies the impairment models for available for-sale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the steps required when assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt instrument. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to how an entity should recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The guidance specifies that an entity who is a lessee under lease agreements should recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under previous FASB guidance. Accounting for leases by lessors is largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance to change the subsequent measurement of inventory from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance related to revenue recognition. This guidance will replace current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition guidance provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. The FASB deferred the effective date for this guidance by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after such date. Earlier application of this guidance is permitted but not before the original date of December 15, 2016. In accordance with the deferred effective date, the Company is required to adopt the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this new accounting guidance and the transition alternatives on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Note 3. Discontinued Operations    
  Lumentum Separation 
  On   August 1, 2015  , the Company completed the separation of the Lumentum business (the  Separation ) and made a tax-free distribution of approximately   80.1%   of the outstanding shares of Lumentum common stock to Viavi shareholders who received   one   share of Lumentum common stock for every   five   shares of Viavi common stock held as of the close of business on July 27, 2015 (the  Record Date ) and not sold prior to August 4, 2015 (the  ex-dividend date ). In connection with the Separation Viavi agreed to contribute   $137.6 million   all of which was contributed during fiscal 2016. As of the Distribution, Viavi retained ownership of approximately   19.9%  , or   11.7 million   shares, of Lumentum s outstanding shares. Lumentum was formed to hold Viavi s CCOP business and the WaveReady product line. As a result of the Distribution, Lumentum is now an independent public company. The Company agreed not to liquidate the retained shares during the first six months following the Distribution. However, in connection with a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, the Company committed to liquidate these shares within three

years from the Distribution. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company owns approximately   3.4 million   shares, of Lumentum s common stock. Refer to   Note 7. Investments, Forward Contracts and Fair Value Measurements   for more information. 
  As the separation of the Lumentum business represented a strategic shift that had and will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results, the results of operations and net assets of the Lumentum business are presented separately as discontinued operations for the   three months ended     October 3, 2015   and as of   July 2, 2016  , in accordance with the authoritative guidance. 
  As of the Separation Date, Lumentum became a stand-alone public company that separately reports its financial results. Due to the difference between the basis of presentation for discontinued operations and the basis of presentation as a stand-alone company, the financial results of Lumentum included within discontinued operations for the Company may not be indicative of actual financial results of Lumentum as a stand-alone company. 
  The removal of Lumentum s net assets and equity related adjustments upon the Separation are presented as an increase of Viavi's accumulated deficit and represents a non-cash financing activity, excluding the cash transferred. Refer to    Note 14. Stock-Based Compensation    for information on modifications to stock-based compensation awards as a result of the Distribution. 
  The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations of the Lumentum business included in the condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations   (in millions)  : 

(1)    No income or expense has been recorded relating to the Lumentum business after the separation from Viavi on   August 1, 2015  . 
  During the   three months ended     October 3, 2015  , the income tax provision for discontinued operations of   $35.0 million  , included approximately   $5.6 million   cash taxes that were due to federal and state authorities as a result of the Separation. In addition, approximately   $29.6 million   of the income tax provision for discontinued operations related to the income tax intraperiod tax allocation rules in relation to continuing operations and other comprehensive income. 
  Discontinued operations also includes other costs incurred by the Company to separate Lumentum. These costs include transaction charges, advisory and consulting fees. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations includes transaction, advisory and other costs to effect the separation of   $14.0 million   for the three months ended   October 3, 2015  .

The following table sets forth the weighted-average potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation of the diluted net income (loss) per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive (  in millions  ): 

(1)   As the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations in the period, potential dilutive securities from employee stock options, employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP ) and Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ) have been excluded from the diluted net loss per share computations as their effects were deemed anti-dilutive. 
    
  (2)   The Company s   0.625%   Senior Convertible 2033 Notes are not included in the table above. The par amount of convertible notes is payable in cash equal to the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest and then the  in-the-money  conversion benefit feature at the conversion price above   $11.28   per share is payable in cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of both at the Company s election. Refer to    Note 10. Debts and Letters of Credit    for more details. 
   
  Note 5. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

(1) Activity before reclassifications to the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   relates to the unrealized gain on the marketable equity securities of Lumentum held by Viavi. The amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income relates to the realized gain from the sale of the marketable equity securities of Lumentum. There was   no     tax impact   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  . 
    
  (2)    The amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income represents the amortization of actuarial losses included as a component of cost of revenues, research and development ( R D ) and selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A ) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  . There was   no   tax impact. Refer to    Note 15. Employee Pension and Other Benefit Plans    for more details on the computation of net periodic cost for pension plans.

Fair Value Measurements 
  Assets measured at fair value as of   October 1, 2016   and   July 2, 2016   are summarized below (  in millions  ): 

(1) $  287.5 million   in cash and cash equivalents,   $558.8 million   in short-term investments,   $10.9 million   in restricted cash, $  1.8 million   in prepayments and other current assets, and   $4.9 million   in other non-current assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   October 1, 2016  .   $295.4 million   in cash and cash equivalents,   $484.7 million   in short-term investments,   $11.3 million   in restricted cash, and   $4.5 million   in other non-current assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   July 2, 2016  . 
           (2) $  1.5 million   in other current liabilities on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   October 1, 2016  . 
  Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. There is an established hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. 
  The Company s cash and investment instruments are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on quoted prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.  
  
   14 

Table of Contents  
      VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC. 
      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Level 1 includes financial instruments for which quoted market prices for identical instruments are available in active markets. Level 1 assets of the Company include money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities as they are traded with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.  
                
    Level 2 includes financial instruments for which the valuations are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 instruments of the Company generally include certain U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate and municipal bonds and notes, asset-backed securities, and foreign currency forward contracts. To estimate their fair value, the Company utilizes pricing models based on market data. The significant inputs for the valuation model usually include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker and dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data, and industry and economic events.  
                
    Level 3 includes financial instruments for which fair value is derived from valuation based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. As of   October 1, 2016   and   July 2, 2016  , the Company did not hold any Level 3 investment securities. 
     Non-Designated Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
  The Company has foreign subsidiaries that operate and sell the Company s products in various markets around the world. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risks. The Company utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts and other instruments to manage foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily certain short-term intercompany receivables and payables, and to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows related to foreign-currency transactions. The Company does not use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes. 
  As of   October 1, 2016   and   July 2, 2016  , the notional amounts of the forward contracts the Company held to purchase foreign currencies were   $119.9 million   and   $110.0 million  , respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts the Company held to sell foreign currencies were   $56.4 million   and   $55.2 million  , respectively. The fair values of the Company s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were not material as of   July 2, 2016  . 
   As of   October 1, 2016   the Company had forward contracts that were effectively closed but not settled with the counterparties by quarter end; therefore, the fair value of these contracts of $  1.8   million and   $1.5   million is reflected as prepayments and other current assets and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   October 1, 2016  , respectively.  
  The change in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is recorded as gain or loss in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of Interest and other income (expense), net. The cash flows related to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts are classified as operating activities 
  The gains on foreign exchange forward contracts were   $0.3 million   and   $0.6 million   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively.

Note 10. Debts and Letters of Credit 
  As of   October 1, 2016   and   July 2, 2016  , the Company s long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represented the carrying amount of the liability component, net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance cost, of the 0.625% Senior Convertible Notes as discussed below. The following table presents the carrying amounts of the liability and equity components (  in millions  ): 

(1) 
    In April   2015  , the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new authoritative guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. This guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal   2017   for its convertible debt, and was applied retrospectively for all periods reported.  
              (2) 
    Included in Accumulated paid-in-capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
     The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants and held   no   short term debt as of   October 1, 2016   and   July 2, 2016  . 
  0.625% Senior Convertible Notes ( 2033 Notes ) 
  On August 21, 2013, the Company issued   $650.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   0.625%   Senior Convertible Notes due 2033 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The proceeds from the 2033 Notes amounted to   $636.3 million   after issuance costs. The 2033 Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at an annual rate of 0.625% payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 2033 Notes mature on August 15, 2033 unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.  
  Following the Separation on   August 1, 2015  , the conversion price per share was adjusted pursuant to the terms of the 2033 Notes relating to the occurrence of the Separation. Effective as of the end of the business day on August 17, 2015, the initial conversion price per share was adjusted to   $11.28   per share of the Company s common stock traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol  VIAV.  The 2033 Notes and its terms are described in  Note 11. Debts and Letters of Credit  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   July 2, 2016  .  
  Based on quoted market prices as of   October 1, 2016   and   July 2, 2016  , the fair value of the 2033 Notes was approximately   $649.3 million   and   $633.0 million  . The 2033 Notes are classified within Level 2 as they are not actively traded in markets.

Payments related to the remaining severance and benefits accrual are expected to be paid by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 
  NE Lease Restructuring Plan 
  During the second quarter of fiscal 2014, Management approved a NE plan to exit the remaining space in Germantown, Maryland. As of June 28, 2014, the Company exited the space in Germantown under the plan.

  The income tax expense related to the income (loss) from continuing operations recorded for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   primarily relates to income tax in certain foreign and state jurisdictions based on the Company s forecasted pre-tax income or loss for the respective year.  In addition, for the three months ended October 3, 2015, the Company s income tax provision includes a tax benefit of   $13.4 million   related to the income tax intraperiod tax allocation rules for discontinued operations and other comprehensive income, and a tax expense of   $8.9 million   related to a one-time increase in valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets transferred to Lumentum in connection with the Separation. 
  The income tax expense related to the income (loss) from continuing operations recorded differs from the expected tax expense (benefit) that would be calculated by applying the federal statutory rate to the Company s income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes primarily due to the changes in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets attributable to the Company s domestic and foreign income (loss)from continuing operations, the income tax benefit recorded in continuing operations under

      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

the income tax intraperiod tax allocation rules, and the increase in valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets transferred to Lumentum in connection with the separation. 
  As of   October 1, 2016   and   July 2, 2016  , the Company s unrecognized tax benefits totaled   $41.8 million   and   $41.7 million  , respectively, and are included in deferred taxes and other non-current tax liabilities, net. The Company had   $1.8 million   accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at   October 1, 2016  . The unrecognized tax benefits that may be recognized during the next twelve months are approximately   $1.0 million  . 
   
  Note 13. Stockholders' Equity    
  Repurchase of Common Stock 
  In September   2016  , the Board of Directors increased the Company s previously authorized stock repurchase program from   $100 million   to   $150 million  . Under the revised repurchase authorization, the Company may repurchase up to   $150 million   of the Company s common stock from time to time at the discretion of the Company s management.  This stock repurchase authorization expires on December 31, 2017. 
    
   During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company repurchased approximately   3.4 million   shares of its common stock for   $25.5 million  . As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had remaining authorization of   $120.0 million   for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including business and financial market conditions. 
    
  All common shares repurchased under this program have been canceled and retired. 
   
  Note 14. Stock-Based Compensation    
  Overview 
  The impact on the Company s results of operations of recording stock-based compensation by function for the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   was as follows (in millions): 

Approximately   $0.8 million   and   $1.3 million   of stock-based compensation was capitalized to inventory at   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   respectively. 
  Full Value Awards 
  Full Value Awards refer to RSUs and Performance Units that are granted with the exercise price equal to   zero   and are converted to shares immediately upon vesting. These Full Value Awards are performance-based, time-based or a combination of both and expected to vest over   one   to   four   years. The fair value of the time-based Full Value Awards is based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of award. 
  During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , the Company granted   3.5 million   and   4.7 million   RSUs, of which   0.4 million   and   0.5 million  , respectively, are performance-based RSUs with market conditions ( MSUs ). These MSU shares represent the target amount of grants, and the actual number of shares awarded upon vesting of the MSUs may be higher or lower depending upon the achievement of the relevant market conditions. The majority of MSUs vest in equal annual installments over   three years   based on the attainment of certain total shareholder return performance measures and the employee s continued service through the vest date. The aggregate grant-date fair value of MSUs granted in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were estimated to be   $3.3 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively, and was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The remaining   3.1 million   and   4.2 million   granted during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively,  
  
   20 

Table of Contents  
      VIAVI SOLUTIONS INC. 
      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

are time-based RSUs. The majority of these time-based RSUs vest over   three years  , with   33%   vesting after   one year   and the balance vesting quarterly over the remaining   two years  .  
  As of   October 1, 2016  ,   $53.1 million   of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to Full Value Awards remains to be amortized. That cost is expected to be recognized over an estimated amortization period of   2.2 years  . 
  Full Value Awards are converted into shares upon vesting. Shares equivalent in value to the minimum withholding tax liability on the vested shares are withheld by the Company for the payment of such taxes. During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , the Company paid   $5.8 million   and   $6.4 million  , respectively, and classified the payments as operating cash outflows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
  Impact on Stock-based Compensation Due to Separation 
  In connection with the separation of the Lumentum business on   August 1, 2015   and in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement, the Company made certain adjustments to the exercise price and number of shares underlying stock-based compensation awards with the intention of preserving the economic value of the awards for Viavi employees. These adjustments resulted in a modification of equity awards with total incremental stock-based compensation of   $13.6 million  , to be amortized over the remaining requisite service period from Separation Date to the end of the vesting term. As of   October 1, 2016  ,   $2.9 million   of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost remains to be amortized. 
  Valuation Assumptions 
  The Company estimates the fair value of the new MSUs granted using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the assumptions described below for the following periods:

Note 15. Employee Pension and Other Benefit Plans    
  The Company sponsors significant qualified and non-qualified pension plans for certain past and present employees in the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) and Germany. The Company also is responsible for the non-pension post-retirement benefit obligation assumed from a past acquisition. All of the plans have been closed to new participants and no additional service costs are being accrued, except for certain plans in Germany assumed in connection with acquisitions during fiscal 2010. Benefits are generally based upon years of service and compensation or stated amounts for each year of service.  
  As of   October 1, 2016   the U.K. plan was partially funded while the other plans were unfunded. The Company s policy for funded plans is to make contributions equal to or greater than the requirements prescribed by law or regulation. For unfunded plans, the Company pays the post-retirement benefits when due. During the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , the Company contributed   $0.6 million   to the U.K. plan. The funded plan assets consist primarily of managed investments.  
  The following table presents the components of the net periodic cost for the pension and benefits plans (  in millions  ): 

Both the calculation of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic cost are based upon actuarial valuations. These valuations use participant-specific information such as salary, age, years of service, and assumptions about interest rates, pension increases and other factors. At a minimum, the Company evaluates these assumptions annually and makes changes as necessary. 
  The Company expects to incur cash outlays of approximately   $6.3 million   related to its defined benefit pension plans during fiscal 2017 to make current benefit payments and fund future obligations. As of   October 1, 2016  , approximately   $1.4 million   had been incurred. These payments have been estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company s projected benefit obligation at   July 2, 2016  . 
   
  Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies    
  Legal Proceedings 
  In June   2016  , the Company received a court decision regarding the validity of an amendment to a pension deed of trust related to one of its foreign subsidiaries which the Company contends contained an error requiring the Company to increase the pension plan s benefit. The Company had subsequently further amended the deed to rectify the error. The court ruled that the amendment increasing the pension plan benefit was valid until the subsequent amendment. The Company determined that the likelihood of loss to be probable as of   July 2, 2016   and accrued GBP   5.7 million  , or   $8.4 million  , in accordance with authoritative guidance on contingencies. The Company has appealed the court decision and is considering pursuing a claim against the U.K. law firm responsible for the error.  
  The Company is subject to a variety of claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against the Company, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. 
  Guarantees 
  In accordance with authoritative guidance which requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. In addition, disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a tabular reconciliation of the changes of the entity s product warranty liabilities, are required.

      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third-party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements, under which the Company may provide customary indemnifications to purchasers of the Company s businesses or assets; (ii) certain real estate leases, under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities, and other claims arising from the Company s use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with the Company s officers, directors and employees, under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship. 
  The terms of such obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and   no   liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheet as of   October 1, 2016   and   July 2, 2016  . 
  Product Warranties 
  In general, the Company offers a   three  -year warranty for most of its products. The Company provides reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. The Company estimates the costs of its warranty obligations based on its historical experience of known product failure rates, use of materials to repair or replace defective products and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise with specific products. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. 
  The following table presents the changes in the Company s warranty reserve during fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016   (  in millions  ): 

Note 17. Operating Segments and Geographic Information    
  The Company evaluates its reportable segments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on segment reporting. The Company s Chief Executive Officer, Oleg Khaykin, is the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ) pursuant to the guidance. The CODM allocates resources to the segments based on their business prospects, competitive factors, net revenue and operating results. 
  The Company is a leading provider of software and hardware platforms and instruments that deliver end-to-end visibility across physical, virtual and hybrid networks.

  The CODM manages the Company in   two   broad business categories: Network and Service Enablement ("NSE") and OSP. NSE operates in   two   segments, NE and SE, whereas OSP operates as a single segment. The CODM evaluates segment performance of the NSE business based on NE and SE segment gross margin and NSE operating margin as a whole. Operating expenses associated with the NSE business are not allocated to the NE and SE segments within NSE, as they are managed centrally at the business unit level. The CODM evaluates segment performance of the OSP business based on OSP segment operating margin.  
  The Company does not allocate stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangibles, restructuring and related charges, impairment of goodwill, non-operating income and expenses, or other non-core operating and non-recurring charges to its segments because Management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. These items are presented as  Reconciling Items  in the table below. Additionally, the Company does not specifically identify and allocate all assets by operating segment. 
  The segment information for all periods presented has been revised to be comparable with the changes in the Company s segment reporting measures.

OUR INDUSTRIES AND QUARTERLY DEVELOPMENTS 
  Viavi Solutions Inc.   ( Viavi,  also referred to as  the Company,   we,   our,  and  us ) is a global provider of network test, monitoring and assurance solutions to communications service providers, enterprises and their ecosystems, supported by a worldwide channel community. We deliver end-to-end visibility across physical, virtual and hybrid networks, enabling customers to optimize connectivity, quality of experience and profitability. Viavi is also a leader in high performance thin film optical coatings, providing light management solutions to anti-counterfeiting, consumer electronics, automotive, defense and instrumentation markets.  
  On   August 1, 2015  , we completed the distribution of approximately   80.1%   of the outstanding shares of Lumentum Holdings Inc. ( Lumentum ) common stock to our stockholders (the  Separation ). We were renamed Viavi and, at the time of the distribution, retained ownership of approximately   19.9%   of Lumentum s outstanding shares. See    Note 1. Basis of Presentation    for additional information. Following the Separation in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we made changes to our segment measures to reflect how the CODM manages the business post-separation as described in    Note 17. Operating Segments and Geographic Information  .  
  To serve our markets we operate in the following business segments: 
             
    Network Enablement ( NE ) 
                
    Service Enablement ( SE ) 
                
    Optical Security and Performance Products ( OSP )  
     Network Enablement 
  NE provides an integrated portfolio of testing solutions that access the network to perform build-out and maintenance tasks. These solutions include instruments, software and services to design, build, turn-up, certify, troubleshoot, and optimize networks. They also support more profitable, higher-performing networks and help speed time-to-revenue. 
  Our solutions address lab and production environments, field deployment and service assurance for wireless and wireline networks, including storage networks. Our test instrument portfolio is one of the largest in the industry, with hundreds of thousands of units in active use by major NEMs, operators and services providers worldwide. Designed to be mobile, these products include instruments and software that access the network to perform installation and maintenance tasks that help service provider technicians assess the performance of network elements and segments and verify the integrity of the information being transmitted across the network. These instruments are highly intelligent and have user interfaces that are designed to simplify operations and minimize the training required to operate them. Our NE solutions are also used by NEMs in the design and production of next-generation network equipment. 
  Viavi also offers a range of product support and professional services designed to comprehensively address our customers  requirements. These services include repair, calibration, software support and technical assistance for our products. We offer product and technology training as well as consulting services. Our professional services, provided in conjunction with system integration projects, include project management, installation and implementation. 
  NE customers include wireless and fixed services providers, NEMs, government organizations and large corporate customers, such as major telecom, mobility and cable operators, chip and infrastructure vendors, storage-device manufacturers, storage-network and switch vendors, and deployed private enterprise customers. Our customers include Alcatel-Lucent International, Am rica M vil, S.A.B. de C.V., AT T Inc., CenturyLink, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Nokia Solutions and Networks, Reliance Industries, Time Warner Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. 
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we re-grouped our NE products and associated services from three product groupings to two as described below: 
  Field Instruments:   Primarily consisting of (a) Access and Cable products; (b) Fiber Instrument products; (c) Metro products; and (d) RF Test products (formerly called out separately). 
  Lab Instruments:   Primarily consisting of (a) Capacity Advisor products; (b) Fiber Optic Production Lab Test ; (c) Optical Transport products; and (d) Storage Network Test products. 
  Additionally, following the Separation we no longer sell products or services from the WaveReady product line. We also moved our Video Assurance products (formerly a component of Media, Access and Content) to our SE segment. For the purposes of providing year-over-year variance analysis in the Results of Operations section below we have reflected these changes for all prior periods presented so that they are comparable with our current groupings.

Service Enablement 
  SE provides embedded systems and enterprise performance management solutions that give global service providers, enterprises and cloud operators visibility into network, service and application data. These solutions - which primarily consist of instruments, microprobes and software - monitor, collect and analyze network data to reveal the actual customer experience and identify opportunities for new revenue streams and network optimization. 
  Our portfolio of SE solutions address the same lab and production environments, field deployment and service assurance for wireless and fixed communications networks, including storage networks, as our NE portfolio. Our solutions let carriers remotely monitor performance and quality of network, service and applications performance throughout the entire network. This provides our customers with enhanced network management, control, and optimization that allow network operators to initiate service to new customers faster, decrease the need for technicians to make on-site service calls, help to make necessary repairs faster and, as a result, lower costs while providing higher quality and more reliable services. Remote monitoring decreases operating expenses, while early detection helps increase uptime, preserve revenue, and helps operators better monetize their networks. 
  SE customers include the same wireless and fixed services providers, NEMs, government organizations, large corporate customers, and storage-segment customers that are served by our NE segment. 
  During the first quarter of fiscal   2017  , we re-grouped our SE products and associated services from three product groupings to two as described below: 
  Data Center:     Consisting of our Network Instrument products. 
  Assurance:   Primarily consisting of our (a) Mature Products (Legacy Assurance, Legacy Wireline, Protocol Test, Video Assurance products and RAN (formerly component of Wireless)) (b) Growth Products (Xsight, Packet Portal products, Location Intelligence (formerly components of Wireless)). 
  For the purposes of providing year-over-year variance analysis in the Results of Operations section below we have reflected these changes for all prior periods presented so that they are comparable with our current groupings. 
  Optical Security and Performance Products  
  OSP leverages its core optical coating technologies and volume manufacturing capability to design, manufacture, and sell products targeting anti-counterfeiting, consumer and industrial, government, healthcare and other markets 
  OSP s security offerings for the currency market include OVP , OVMP  and banknote thread substrates. OVP  enables a color-shifting effect used by banknote issuers and security printers worldwide for anti-counterfeiting applications on currency and other high-value documents and products. OVP  protects the currencies of more than 120 countries today. OSP also develops and delivers overt and covert anti-counterfeiting products that utilize its proprietary printing platform and are targeted primarily at the pharmaceutical and consumer-electronics markets.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  For a description of the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, refer to Item 7 on Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The results of operations for the current period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for future periods. As fiscal 2017 is a 52-week year compared to a 53-week year in fiscal 2016, the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   contains one less week of activity compared to the   three months ended     October 3, 2015  . 
  The following table summarizes selected Consolidated Statements of Operations items (  in millions, except for percentages  ): 

Net Revenue 
   
  Following the Separation, revenue from our service offerings exceeds 10% of our total consolidated net revenue and is presented separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Service revenue primarily consists of maintenance and support, extended warranty, professional services and post-contract support in addition to other services such as rentals, loaners and repair services. When evaluating the performance of our segments, Management focuses on total net revenue, gross profit and operating income and not the product or service categories. Consequently, the following discussion of business segment performance focuses on total net revenue, gross profit, and operating income consistent with our approach for managing the business. 
  Three months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015    
  Net revenue   decrease  d by   $18.9 million  , or   8.2%  , during   three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the same period a year ago. This   decrease   was primarily due to   decrease  s in our SE and OSP segments, partially offset by an   increase   in our NE segment as discussed below. 
  Product revenues   decrease  d   $11.9 million  , or   5.9%  , during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the same period a year ago, primarily due to lower demand for our Anti-Counterfeiting product line in our OSP segment driven by decreased bank-note volume and a decrease in SE product revenue as described below. Service revenues   decrease  d   $7.0 million  , or   23.7%  ,  
  
   30 

Table of Contents  

during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to a decline in support contract renewals for our more mature assurance portfolio solutions in our SE segment. 
   
  NE net revenue   increase  d by   $1.0 million  , or   0.9%  , during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the same period a year ago. This   increase   was driven by a $1.3 million increase in our Lab Instrument product line resulting from new product acceptance from a major customer. Revenue from our Field Instrument business was flat, where an increase in revenue from fiber test instruments, driven by high demand for 100G optical products was offset by weakness in Access and Cable and Metro products due to softness in spending by North America communication service providers.   
   
  SE net revenue   decrease  d by   $11.5 million  , or   24.0%  , during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the same period a year ago. This   decrease   was primarily driven by $7.4 million of net revenue decreases from our Assurance offerings primarily driven by a decline in our more mature solutions as service maintenance contracts expire and $4.1 million of net revenue decreases from our Data Center relating to prior large deals that did not recur in the current quarter. 
   
  OSP net revenue   decrease  d by $  8.4 million  , or   13.1%  , during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the same period a year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by net revenue decreases from our Anti-Counterfeiting product line driven by cyclical demand for our currency products resulting from lower bank-note volume in the current period. The decrease was partially offset by net revenue growth in our Consumer and Industrial product lines. 
   
  Going forward, we expect to continue to encounter a number of industry and market risks and uncertainties that may limit our visibility, and consequently, our ability to predict future revenue, profitability and general financial performance, and that could create quarter over quarter variability in our financial measures. For example, while the majority of our net revenue and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, a portion of our international operations are denominated in foreign currencies. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could negatively impact reported revenue and expenses. Additionally, we have seen demand for our NE and SE products affected by macroeconomic uncertainty. We cannot predict when or to what extent these uncertainties will be resolved. Our revenues, profitability, and general financial performance may also be affected by: (a) strong pricing pressures due to, among other things, a highly concentrated customer base, increasing competition, particularly from Asia-based competitors, and a general commoditization trend for certain products; (b) high product mix variability in our NE and SE markets, which affects revenue and gross margin; (c) fluctuations in customer buying patterns, which cause demand, revenue and profitability volatility; and (d) the current trend of communication industry consolidation, which is expected to continue, that directly affects our NE and SE customer bases and adds additional risk and uncertainty to our financial and business projections. Additionally, we expect to continue to see a decline in net revenue from our more mature Assurance products within our SE segment.

Revenue by Region and Significant Customers 
  We operate in three geographic regions: Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ). Net revenue is assigned to the geographic region and country where our product is initially shipped. For example, certain customers may request shipment of our product to a contract manufacturer in one country, which may differ from the location of their end customers. The following table presents net revenue by geographic regions we operate in and net revenue from countries that exceeded 10% of our total net revenue (  dollars in millions  ):  

Net revenue from customers outside the Americas during the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   represented   51.5%   and   48.2%   of net revenue, respectively. We expect revenue from customers outside of North America to continue to be an important part of our overall net revenue and an increasing focus for net revenue growth opportunities. 
   
  Gross Margin 
   
  Gross margin decreased by   1.9   percentage points during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   from   61.2%   in the same period a year ago to   59.3%   in the current period. This decrease was primarily due to gross margin reduction in our SE segment, which   decrease  d   11.2   percentage points compared to the same period a year ago, on unfavorable product mix from lower Enterprise revenue, coupled with lower margin pass-through hardware revenue mix in our Growth Assurance business as a result of solution acceptance by our key customer.  

As discussed in more detail under  Net Revenue  above, we sell products in certain markets that are consolidating, undergoing product, architectural and business model transitions, have high customer concentrations, are highly competitive (increasingly due to Asia-Pacific-based competition), are price sensitive and/or are affected by customer seasonal and mix variant buying patterns. We expect these factors to continue to result in variability of our gross margin. 
   
  Research and Development 
   
  R D expense   decrease  d by   $8.2 million  , or   18.5%  , during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the same period a year ago. This   decrease   was primarily driven by net cost savings realized from our strategic restructuring activities related to site consolidations and internal reorganizations to align our investment strategy following the Separation, coupled with a lower incremental stock-based compensation charge of $1.1 million due to modification of equity awards in connection with the Separation. As a percentage of net revenue R D   decrease  d by   2.2   percentage points during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the same period a year ago as the Company continued to execute targeted cost savings initiatives.  
   
  We believe that continuing our investments in R D is critical to attaining our strategic objectives. We plan to continue to invest in R D and new products that will further differentiate us in the marketplace.

Table of Contents  

Selling, General and Administrative 
   
  SG A expense   decrease  d by   $19.5 million  , or   20.5%  , during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the same period a year ago. This   decrease   was primarily due to (a) a $8.0 million reduction in labor, facilities and other expenses driven by lower headcount and site consolidations associated with our strategic restructuring activities and ongoing cost reduction efforts, (b) a $6.0 million net reduction in stock-based compensation primarily due to the impact of Separation related activities on equity awards that did not recur this year and (c) a $5.3 million reduction in costs related to Viavi-specific activities to complete the Separation. As a percentage of net revenue SG A   decrease  d   5.5   percentage points during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the same period a year ago, driven by our strategic cost reduction efforts to optimize our expense structure. 
   
  We intend to continue to focus on reducing our SG A expense as a percentage of net revenue. However, we have in the past experienced, and may continue to experience in the future, certain non-core expenses, such as mergers and acquisitions-related expenses and litigation expenses, which could increase our SG A expenses and potentially impact our profitability expectations in any particular quarter. 
   
  Restructuring and Related Charges 
  From time to time we have initiated strategic restructuring events primarily intended to reduce costs, consolidate our operations, rationalize the manufacturing of our products and align our businesses in response to market conditions. We estimate annualized gross cost savings of approximately $18.0 million excluding any one-time charges as a result of the restructuring activities initiated in the past year. Refer to    Note 11. Restructuring and Related Charges    for more information. 
    
  Our restructuring and other lease exit cost obligations are net of sublease income or lease settlement estimates of approximately $2.6 million. Our ability to generate sublease income, as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations and recognize the anticipated related savings, is highly dependent upon the economic conditions, particularly commercial real estate market conditions in certain geographies, at the time we negotiate the lease termination and sublease arrangements with third parties as well as the performances by such third parties of their respective obligations. While the amount we have accrued represents the best estimate of the remaining obligations we expect to incur in connection with these plans, estimates are subject to change. Routine adjustments are required and may be required in the future as conditions and facts change through the implementation period. If adverse macroeconomic conditions continue, particularly as they pertain to the commercial real estate market, or if, for any reason, tenants under subleases fail to perform their obligations, we may be required to reduce estimated future sublease income and adjust the estimated amounts of future settlement agreements, and accordingly, increase estimated costs to exit certain facilities. Amounts related to the lease expense, net of anticipated sublease proceeds, will be paid over the respective lease terms through fiscal   2019  . 
   
  Gain on Sale of Investment 
  We sold   3.9 million   shares of Lumentum common stock during the first quarter of fiscal   2017   and recognized a gross realized gain of approximately   $81.5 million  , reflected in "Gain on sale of investment" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and within the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while the cash proceeds received are reflected in  Sales of available-for-sale investments  within the investing activities section. As of   October 1, 2016  , we owned approximately   3.4 million   shares of Lumentum s common stock with an approximate value of   $141.1 million  . Refer to    Note 8. Investments and Fair Value Measurements    for more information. 
   
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  We recorded an income tax expense of   $5.7 million   and   $2.9 million   related to the income (loss) from continuing operations for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively. 
  The income tax expense related to the income (loss) from continuing operations recorded for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   primarily relates to income tax in certain foreign and state jurisdictions based on our forecasted pre-tax income or loss for the respective year. In addition, for the three months ended   October 3, 2015  , our income tax provision includes a tax benefit of   $13.4 million   related to the income tax intraperiod tax allocation rules for discontinued operations and other comprehensive income, and a tax expense of   $8.9 million   related to a one-time increase in valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets transferred to Lumentum in connection with the Separation. 
  The income tax expense related to the income (loss) from continuing operations recorded differs from the expected tax expense (benefit) that would be calculated by applying the federal statutory rate to our income (loss) from continuing operations  
  
   33 

Table of Contents  

before taxes primarily due to the changes in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets attributable to our domestic and foreign income (loss) from continuing operations, the income tax benefit recorded in continuing operations under the income tax intraperiod tax allocation rules, and the increase in valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets transferred to Lumentum in connection with the Separation. 
  As of   October 1, 2016   and   July 2, 2016  , we had unrecognized tax benefits totaled   $41.8 million   and   $41.7 million  , and are included in deferred taxes and other non-current tax liabilities, net. We had   $1.8 million   accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at   October 1, 2016  . The unrecognized tax benefits that may be recognized during the next twelve months are approximately   $1.0 million  . 
   
  Discontinued Operations 
  Our discontinued operations activities during the three months ended   October 3, 2015  , related to the Separation on   August 1, 2015   and current period activities related to the 2013 sale of the hologram business ( Hologram Business ). 
  Lumentum Separation 
  As of and to the Separation date, the financial results of Lumentum are presented as discontinued operations. For the three months ended   October 3, 2015  , net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to the Lumentum was   $53.7 million  . Refer to   Note 3. Discontinued Operations     for more information. 
  Hologram Business Disposition 
  During the three months ended   October 3, 2015  , we recorded $0.3 million of net income from discontinued operations related to the Hologram Business related to proceeds received following a favorable arbitration ruling to resolve a dispute regarding the amount we were owed under an earn out clause in connection with the sale in 2013. 
   
  Operating Segment Information   (  in millions  ): 

Network Enablement 
  During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , NE gross margin   increase  d   0.9   percentage points from   64.4%   in the same period a year ago to   65.3%   in the current period. This   increase   was primarily due to favorable manufacturing costs resulting from factory utilization in EMEA. 
  Service Enablement

Table of Contents  

During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , SE gross margin   decrease  d   11.2   percentage points from   69.7%   in the same period a year ago to   58.5%   in the current period. This gross margin decrease was primarily due to unfavorable product mix from lower Enterprise revenue, coupled with lower margin pass-through hardware revenue mix in our Growth Assurance business as a result of solution acceptance by our key customer.  
  Network and Service Enablement ( NSE ) 
  During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , NSE operating margin increased   1.1   percentage points from   1.5%   in the same period a year ago to   2.6%   in the current period. This   increase   in operating margin was primarily driven by reductions in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue driven by lower headcount as a result of restructuring plans initiated in fiscal year   2016   and our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by gross margin erosion in our SE segment as discussed above. 
   
  Optical Security and Performance Products 
  OSP operating margin   increase  d   0.9%   during the   three months ended     October 1, 2016   from   41.0%   in the same period a year ago to   41.9%   in the current period. . The   increase   in operating margin was primarily due to higher factory utilization, reductions in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by an un-favorable product mix. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our cash investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and has not changed from that disclosed in our 10-K. All debt securities held were of investment grade (at least BBB-/Baa3). As of   October 1, 2016  , U.S. entities owned approximately   68.4%   of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the majority of our cash investments have maturities of 90 days or less and are of high credit quality. Although we intend to hold these investments to maturity, in the event that we are required to sell any of these securities under adverse market conditions, losses could be recognized on such sales. During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016  , we have not realized material investment losses but can provide no assurance that the value or the liquidity of our investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. In addition, we maintain cash balances in operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions. These balances in the U.S. may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insurance limits. While we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail. 
   
  Three Months Ended     October 1, 2016 
  As of   October 1, 2016   our combined balance of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, including marketable equity securities, and restricted cash   increased   by   $64.4 million   to   $1,044.2 million   from   $979.8 million   as of   July 2, 2016  . 
  During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016     Cash provided by   operating activities was   $10.3 million  , consisted of net income of $  78.0 million   adjusted for non-cash charges (e.g., depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation) which totaled $  31.8 million  , including changes in deferred tax balance less gain on sale of investment of $  81.5 million  , offset by net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of   $18.0 million  . Net decreases in our operating assets and liabilities related primarily to   a decrease in accrued payroll and related expenses   of   $7.3 million   due to the timing of salary and bonus payments,   a decrease in accounts payable   of   $10.2 million   driven by the timing of payments,   an increase in accounts receivable   of   $17.2 million   primarily driven by timing of collections, and   a decrease in deferred revenue   of   $12.2 million   due to amortization of support agreements and the release of revenue upon customer acceptance. This was offset by   an increase in accrued expenses and other current and non-current liabilities   of   $32.8 million   due a customer prepayment offset by restructuring payments,   a decrease in inventories   of   $3.0 million  . 
  During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016     Cash provided by   investing activities was   $1.6 million  , primarily from the sale of 3.9 million shares of marketable equity securities relating to Lumentum stock which generated $  114.6 million   of cash proceeds offset by $  103.7 million   of net purchase, sales and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities and   $11.6 million   of cash used for capital expenditures.  
  During the   three months ended     October 1, 2016     Cash used in   financing activities was   $22.4 million  , primarily resulting from   $25.5 million   in repurchase of our common stock, which was partially offset by   $3.3 million   in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.

Three Months Ended     October 3, 2015 
  As of October 3, 2015 our combined balance of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, including marketable equity securities, and restricted cash increased by $77.5 million to $903.1 million from $825.6 million as of June 27, 2015 including cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $13.8 million transferred to Lumentum. Additionally, the cash provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities below contains activities related to Lumentum through the separation date. 
  During the three months ended October 3, 2015   cash used in   operating activities was $0.3 million, consisted of net loss of $69.1 million adjusted for non-cash charges (e.g., depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation) which totaled $74.5 million, including changes in our deferred tax and other tax liabilities balances, offset by net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $5.7 million. Our cash used by operating activities was also impacted by our separation related activities. Net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities related primarily to   a decrease in accrued payroll and related expenses   of $12.8 million due to timing of salary and bonus payments, a decrease in accrued expenses and other current and non-current liabilities of $11.1 million mainly due to Lumentum related liabilities paid post spin-off and   an increase in inventories   of $4.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in Lumentum related accounts receivable of $21.0 million driven by collections timing prior to spin-off. 
  During the three months ended October 3, 2015 cash provided by investing activities was $110.0 million, primarily resulting from $206.9 million of   proceeds from the sales and maturities of available-for-sale investments and other assets   and a $15.1 million decrease in restricted cash, partially offset by $97.8 million of purchases of available-for-sale investments and $14.2 million of cash used for capital expenditures. 
  During the three months ended October 3, 2015   cash used in   financing activities was $101.5 million, primarily resulting activities related to the Separation during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In accordance with the Contribution Agreement, the Company made cash contributions of $136.7 million to Lumentum which was partially offset by proceeds of $35.8 million from the sale of Lumentum Series A Preferred Stock to Amada Holdings Co., Ltd. ( Amada ) pursuant to a binding commitment under the Securities Purchase Agreement. 

We believe that our existing cash balances and investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements over the next twelve months. However, there are a number of factors that could positively or negatively impact our liquidity position, including: 
             
    global economic conditions which affect demand for our products and services and impact the financial stability of our suppliers and customers; 
                
    changes in accounts receivable, inventory or other operating assets and liabilities which affect our working capital; 
                
    increase in capital expenditure to support the revenue growth opportunity of our business; 
                
    changes in customer payment terms and patterns, which typically results in customers delaying payments or negotiating favorable payment terms to manage their own liquidity positions; 
                
    timing of payments to our suppliers; 
                
    factoring or sale of accounts receivable; 
                
    volatility in fixed income and credit market which impact the liquidity and valuation of our investment portfolios; 
                
    volatility in foreign exchange market which impacts our financial results; 
                
    possible investments or acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies; 
                
    issuance or repurchase of debt or equity securities, which may include open market purchases of our 2033 Notes prior to their maturity or of our common stock; 
                
    potential funding of pension liabilities either voluntarily or as required by law or regulation; and 
                
    compliance with covenants and other terms and conditions related to our financing arrangements.

Contractual Obligations 
  There were   no   material changes to our existing contractual commitments during the first quarter of fiscal   2017  , except for those occurring in the normal course of business. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have   no   off-balance sheet arrangements, other than the guarantees discussed in    Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies  .  
   
  Employee Equity Incentive Plan 
  Our stock-based benefit plans are a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain employees and align stockholder and employee interests. There were   no   material changes to our existing stock-based benefit plans. Refer to    Note 14. Stock-Based Compensation    for more details. 
   
  Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits 
  We sponsor significant pension plans for certain past and present employees in the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) and Germany. We are also responsible for the non-pension post-retirement benefit obligation or PBO assumed from a past acquisition. All of these plans have been closed to new participants and no additional service costs are being accrued, except for certain plans in Germany assumed in connection with acquisitions during fiscal 2010. The U.K. plan is partially funded and the Germany plans, which were initially established as  pay-as-you-go  plans, are unfunded. As of   October 1, 2016  , our pension plans were under funded by   $107.5   million since the PBO exceeded the fair value of its plan assets. Similarly, we had a liability of   $1.2   million related to our non-pension post-retirement benefit plan. Pension plan assets are managed by external third parties and we monitor the performance of our investment managers. As of   October 1, 2016  , the fair value of plan assets had increased approximately   7.4%   since   July 2, 2016  , our most recent fiscal year end. 
  A key actuarial assumption in calculating the net periodic cost and the PBO is the discount rate. Changes in the discount rate impact the interest cost component of the net periodic benefit cost calculation and PBO due to the fact that the PBO is calculated on a net present value basis. Decreases in the discount rate will generally increase pre-tax cost, recognized expense and the PBO. Increases in the discount rate tend to have the opposite effect. We estimate a 50 basis point ( BPS ) decrease or increase in the discount rate would cause a corresponding increase or decrease, respectively, in the PBO of approximately   $8.6 million   based upon data as of   July 2, 2016  . 
  In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider historical returns on plan assets, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, inflation assumptions and the impact of active management of the plan s invested assets. While it is not possible to accurately predict future rate movements, we believe our current assumptions are appropriate. Refer to    Note 15. Employee Pension and Other Benefit Plans    for more details. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks 
  The Company s market risk has not changed materially from the foreign exchange and interest rate risks disclosed in Item 7A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   July 2, 2016  . 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 1, 2016.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  As described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   July 2, 2016  , we identified a material weakness related to the design of certain internal controls related to the accounting for the interim income tax provision. 
  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the preparation of the Company s fiscal   2016   Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company s management identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. Specifically, the internal controls with respect to the determination of the interim income tax provision were not designed at a precision level to identify the use of an inaccurate tax rate. This control deficiency could result in a misstatement of the related account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.  For the quarters ended   October 3, 2015  ,   January 2, 2016   and   April 2, 2016  , this control deficiency did result in misstatements of our income tax expense and income taxes payable. 
  Management's Remediation Initiatives 
  Management has evaluated the design and operation of internal controls related to the interim income tax provision and has implemented additional controls related to the preparation and review of the interim income tax provision designed to ensure the use of accurate tax rates. 
  Management has tested the design of the internal controls related to the remediation of the material weakness described above. However, such controls have not been in place and operating for a sufficient period to validate full remediation of the material weakness. Such remediation is anticipated to be completed during fiscal   2017  . 
  Other than the above changes, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter ended   October 1, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  
  We are subject to a variety of claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended   July 2, 2016  .
