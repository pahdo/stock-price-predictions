    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

 September 30, 2016 

 (Unaudited) 

Note (1) - General:  The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EnviroStar, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ).
All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

 The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial statements and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X related to interim period financial statements. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include certain information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. However, in management s
opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal
recurring accruals and adjustments) which are necessary in order to state fairly the Company s results of operations, financial
position and cash flows as of and for the periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future period. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with audited consolidated financial statements and related notes, including
the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2016. The June 30, 2016 balance sheet information contained herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements as of that date included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

 The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. The estimates and assumptions made may not prove to be correct, and actual results could differ
from the estimates. 

  Note (2) - Earnings Per Share: 
At September 30, 2016, the Company had no outstanding options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock or other dilutive
securities and therefore diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share.

 (Unaudited) 

Note (3) - Debt:  At September 30, 2016,
the Company had a revolving line of credit facility (the  2011 Credit Facility ) which allowed for borrowings of up
to $2,250,000. Borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility, if any, bore bear interest at 2.50% per annum above the Adjusted LIBOR
Market Index Rate. The maturity date under the 2011 Credit Facility was November 1, 2016. The Company s obligations under
the 2011 Credit Facility were guaranteed by the Company s subsidiaries and collateralized by substantially all of the assets
of the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2011 Credit Facility required the maintenance of certain fixed charge coverage and leverage
ratios and contained other restrictive covenants, including limitations on the extent to which the Company and its subsidiaries
could incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, guarantee indebtedness of others, grant liens, sell assets and make investments.
The Company was in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. No amounts were outstanding under the
2011 Credit Facility at September 30, 2016 or June 30, 2016, nor were there any amounts outstanding under the 2011 Credit Facility
at any time during fiscal 2016 or the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Effective October 7, 2016, the 2011
Credit Facility was terminated in connection with the Company s entry into a new $20,000,000 credit agreement, consisting
of a maximum $15,000,000 million revolving line of credit and a $5,000,000 term loan. See Note 10,  Subsequent Events , for
additional information regarding the Company s new credit facility. 

  Note (4) - Income Taxes:  The
Company s income tax expense varies from the federal corporate income tax rate of 34%, primarily due to state income taxes,
net of federal income tax effect, and permanent differences. 

 As of September 30, 2016 and June 30,
2016, the Company had deferred tax assets of $112,752 and $121,489 respectively. Consistent with the guidance of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) regarding accounting for income taxes, the Company regularly estimates its
ability to realize deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce the balance
to amounts expected to be recoverable. This evaluation includes the consideration of several factors, including an estimate of
the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in future periods over which temporary differences reverse, the expected
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, past and projected taxable income, and available tax planning strategies. As of September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, management believed that it was more-likely-than not that the results of future operations will generate
sufficient taxable income to realize the net amount of the Company s deferred tax assets over the periods during which temporary
differences reverse. 

 The Company follows Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) Topic 740-10-25,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ).
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of
a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s
accounting for income taxes in accordance with this standard did not result in any adjustment to the Company s provision
for income taxes. 

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company
was subject to potential federal and state tax examinations for the tax years 2013 through 2016. 

  Note (5)   Vendor Deposits: 
Vendor deposits represent advances made to the Company s vendors for specialized inventory on order.

Note (6) - Segment Information: 
Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company reported the results of its operations through two reportable segments: (i)
the Company s commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning equipment and boiler segment, which was comprised of the
operations of Steiner-Atlantic Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( Steiner-Atlantic ); and (ii) the Company s
license and franchise operations segment, which was comprised of the operations of DRYCLEAN USA License Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company. As a result of the significantly reduced activities of DRYCLEAN USA License Corp., effective June 30, 2016, the
license and franchise operations segment ceased to be a separate reportable segment and, accordingly, the Company currently reports
its results of operations through a single reportable segment. 

  Note (7)   Recently Issued Accounting
Guidance : In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers,  as subsequently amended ( ASU No. 2014-09 ). The standard outlines a single comprehensive model
for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition
guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that  an entity recognizes revenue
to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016. The Company is evaluating the impact that adopting this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

In December 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU No. 2015-17 ).  The
amendments in ASU No. 2015-17 eliminate the current requirement for organizations to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities
into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred
tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.  The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods
presented.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that adopting this standard will have on its consolidated financial
statements. 

 In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU No. 2016-02 ) which is designed to increase transparency and
comparability by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing
arrangements. The new standard will require an entity to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term
leases) at the commencement date (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from
a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right
to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that adopting this standard
will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

 While there can be no assurance, management
believes the impact of other issued accounting standards and updates, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact
on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.

Note (8)   Transactions with
Related Parties:  The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Steiner-Atlantic, leases 27,000 square feet of warehouse and
office space from an affiliate of Michael S. Steiner, a director and Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the
Company, pursuant to a lease agreement dated November 1, 2014. Under the lease, which has a term of three years, monthly base rental
payments were $10,275 during the first year of the lease and are $10,580 during the second year of the lease and $10,900 during
the third year of the lease. In addition to base rent, Steiner-Atlantic is responsible under the lease for costs related to real
estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, repairs and insurance. Payments under this lease totaled approximately $34,000 and $33,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

 See also Note 10,  Subsequent Events ,
for a description of the private placement transaction between the Company and an affiliate of Henry M. Nahmad, the Company s
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, which was consummated during October 2016 and the lease which a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company entered into during October 2016 with an affiliate of Dennis Mack and Tom Marks, each of whom was appointed to serve
as Executive Vice President of the Company during October 2016. 

Note (9)   Equity Incentive Plan: 
In November 2015, the Company s stockholders approved the EnviroStar, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ).
The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to awards granted under
the Plan. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not granted any awards under the Plan. 

Note (10)   Subsequent Events:  On
October 10, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition, indirectly through Western State Design, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company ( Western State Design ), of substantially all of the assets of Western State Design, LLC ( WSD ),
a California-based distributor of commercial and industrial laundry equipment and related parts for new laundry facilities and
to the replacement laundry market. In connection with the acquisition, which was completed pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement,
dated September 7, 2016, between the Company, Western State Design, WSD and Dennis Mack and Tom Marks, the two members of WSD (collectively
with WSD, the  Selling Group ), Western State Design also assumed certain of the liabilities of WSD. The Asset Purchase
Agreement provided for a total purchase price for the acquisition of $28,000,000 (subject to certain working capital and other
adjustments). The purchase price consisted of (i) $18,000,000 in cash (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments)
(the  Cash Consideration ) and (ii) 2,044,990 shares of the Company s Common Stock (the  Stock Consideration ).
Based on working capital adjustments made at the closing of the acquisition, the Cash Consideration was increased to approximately
$18,500,000. At the closing of the transaction, the Company paid a total of $18,500,000 of Cash Consideration, of which $2,800,000
was deposited in an escrow account for no less than 18 months after the date of the closing (subject to extension in certain circumstances).
The Company used approximately $12,500,000 of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility described below and the $6,000,000 of cash
paid to the Company in connection with the Private Placement Transaction described below to fund the Cash Consideration. In addition,
at the closing, the Company issued to the Selling Group a total of 1,656,486 shares of the Company s Common Stock. Under
the rules of the NYSE MKT, the issuance of the remaining 388,504 shares of the Stock Consideration requires stockholder approval.
Such shares are expected to be issued following stockholder approval but, in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement,
not earlier than January 1, 2017. This transaction will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance
with ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations.  As the acquirer, the Company will recognize the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at fair value. The excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired will be allocated to intangible assets
and goodwill.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

 September 30, 2016 

 (Unaudited) 

On October 7, 2016, the Company entered
into a $20,000,000 credit agreement (the  2016 Credit Facility ), consisting of a $15,000,000 revolving line of
credit and a $5,000,000 term loan. The Company used approximately $4,900,000 of borrowings under the term loan and
approximately $7,600,000 of borrowings under the line of credit to partially finance the Cash Consideration. The Company also
used approximately $66,000 of borrowings under the term loan to pay fees, costs and expenses arising in connection with the
closing of the 2016 Credit Facility. Interest on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the 2016 Credit
Facility accrues at an annual rate equal to the daily one-month LIBOR plus (i) 2.25% in the case of borrowings under the line
of credit and (ii) 2.85% in the case of borrowings under the term loan. The 2016 Credit Facility has a term of five years and
matures on October 10, 2021. The obligations of the Company under the 2016 Credit Facility are secured by substantially all
of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Company s subsidiaries have jointly and severally
guaranteed the performance of the Company s payment and other obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility. The 2016
Credit Facility also contains affirmative covenants which require the Company to meet certain financial criteria, a fixed
charge coverage ratio, an asset coverage ratio, a senior leverage ratio and a total leverage ratio, as well as other
covenants which may restrict, among other things, the Company s ability to pay dividends, complete merger, acquisition
or similar transactions, make certain capital expenditures, incur certain operating lease expenses, and repurchase shares of
its Common Stock. As previously described, the 2016 Credit Facility replaced the Company s 2011 Credit Facility. 

In addition, on October 10, 2016, the Company
completed the issuance and sale of 1,290,323 shares of its Common Stock to Symmetric Capital II LLC for a total purchase price
of $6,000,000 (the  Private Placement Transaction ) pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated September 7,
2016, between the Company and Symmetric Capital II LLC. The Company used the $6,000,000 of proceeds received by it in connection
with the Private Placement Transaction to fund a portion of the Cash Consideration in connection with the acquisition of WSD. Henry
M. Nahmad, the Company s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, is the Manager of Symmetric Capital II LLC. 

In connection with the closing of the Company s
acquisition of WSD, on October 10, 2016, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Western State Design, entered into a lease
with Tylertown LLC, an affiliate of Dennis Mack and Tom Marks. Each of Dennis Mack and Tom Marks, the two members of WSD, was appointed
to serve as an Executive Vice President of the Company upon the closing of the Company s acquisition of WSD. In addition,
Dennis Mack has been nominated for election to the Company s Board of Directors at the Corporation s 2016 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders. Pursuant to the lease, Western State Design leases an approximately 17,600 square foot facility from Tylertown
LLC. Monthly base rental payments during the initial term of the lease are $12,000. In addition to base rent, Western State Design
is responsible under the lease for costs related to real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, repairs and insurance. The lease
has an initial term of five years and provides for two successive three-year renewal terms at the option of Western State Design.

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.  

  Overview  

 Revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, or the first quarter of fiscal 2017, were approximately $9.5 million, an increase of approximately 51.9% compared
to revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Net earnings for the first quarter
of fiscal 2017 increased by 124.1% to approximately $352,000, or $0.05 per share, compared to the same period of fiscal 2016. The
increases in revenues and earnings are primarily attributable to a large number of sales made at the end of the first quarter of
fiscal 2017 and lower sales numbers in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to delays in shipments and the Company s backlog
at that time. 

 At September 30, 2016, the Company s
cash position decreased by approximately $2.5 million compared to its cash position at June 30, 2016, primarily resulting from
an increase in accounts and trade notes receivable due to a large number of shipments being made in September 2016 for which payments
were not yet due at September 30, 2016 and a reduction in accounts payable as invoices against these shipments were already paid.
In addition, cash decreased as a result of the payment of year-end commissions which were previously accrued. 

  Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 During the first quarter of fiscal 2017,
cash decreased by approximately $2.5 million, compared to an increase of approximately $4.4 million during the same period of fiscal
2016. The following summarizes the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, operating
activities used cash of approximately $2.5 million compared to approximately $4.4 million of cash provided by operating activities
during the same period of fiscal 2016. The cash used by operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was mostly
due to an increase of approximately $3.2 million in accounts receivable, as a large number of shipments were made in September
2016 for which payments were not yet due at September 30, 2016. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, approximately
$567,000 of cash was used to pay accrued sales commissions and year-end bonuses. Also contributing to the cash used by operating
activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $325,000
related to payments made by the Company in connection with the shipments made by it in September 2016. These uses of cash were
partially offset by the Company s net earnings of approximately $352,000 and a reduction in vendor deposits of approximately
$417,000 as specialized equipment previously ordered was received. Also contributing to cash was an approximate $448,000 decrease
in other current assets and a reduction in inventories of approximately $226,000 primarily attributable to the large shipments
of equipment and parts made at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In addition, cash was provided by an increase of approximately
$140,000 in income taxes payable and approximately $62,000 in taxes refunded to the Company from over deposits in fiscal 2016. 

For the first quarter of fiscal 2016,
operating activities provided cash of approximately $4.4 million compared to approximately $4.7 million of cash used by operating
activities during the same period of fiscal 2015. The cash provided by operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal
2016 was mostly due to an increase of approximately $3.3 million in customer deposits attributable to new orders received  

- 12 - 

       Index   

during
that quarter. In addition, cash increased by approximately $771,000 as a result of a decrease in accounts receivable as payments
were received during the quarter for shipments made at the end of fiscal 2015. A reduction in inventories also resulted in an increase
in cash of approximately $496,000. Cash was also provided by the Company s net profit during the first quarter of fiscal
2016 of approximately $157,000. These increases in cash were partially offset by approximately $338,000 of cash used to pay accrued
sales commissions and year-end bonuses and approximately $126,000 of cash used related to an increase in other current assets. 

 No cash was used or provided by investing
or financing activities during the first quarters of fiscal 2017 or 2016. 

 At September 30, 2016, the Company had
a revolving line of credit facility (the  2011 Credit Facility ) which allowed for borrowings of up to $2,250,000.
See Note 3,  Debt , to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report for additional
information regarding the 2011 Credit Facility. Effective October 7, 2016, the 2011 Credit Facility was terminated in connection
with the Company s entry into the 2016 Credit Facility described below. 

 As described in Note 10,  Subsequent Events ,
to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report, on October 10, 2016, the Company
completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Western State Design, LLC ( WSD ), a California-based
distributor of commercial and industrial laundry equipment and related parts for new laundry facilities and to the replacement
laundry market, for Cash Consideration totaling $18,500,000, all of which was paid at the closing, and Stock Consideration consisting
of 2,044,490 shares of the Company s Common Stock, of which 1,656,486 shares were issued at the closing and 388,504 shares
will be issued in the future, subject to stockholder approval as required by the rules of the NYSE MKT. In connection with the
financing of the acquisition, on October 7, 2016, the Company entered into a $20,000,000 credit agreement (the  2016 Credit
Facility ), consisting of a $15,000,000 revolving line of credit and a $5,000,000 term loan. The Company used approximately
$4,900,000 of borrowings under the term loan and approximately $7,600,000 of borrowings under the line of credit to partially finance
the Cash Consideration paid in connection with the acquisition of WSD. The Company also used approximately $66,000 of borrowings
under the term loan to pay fees, costs and expenses arising in connection with the closing of the 2016 Credit Facility. Interest
on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility accrues at an annual rate equal to the daily one-month
LIBOR plus (i) 2.25% in the case of borrowings under the line of credit and (ii) 2.85% in the case of borrowings under the term
loan. The 2016 Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on October 10, 2021. The obligations of the Company under the
2016 Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Company s
subsidiaries have jointly and severally guaranteed the performance of the Company s payment and other obligations under the
2016 Credit Facility. The 2016 Credit Facility also contains affirmative covenants which require the Company to meet certain financial
criteria, a fixed charge coverage ratio, an asset coverage ratio, a senior leverage ratio and a total leverage ratio, as well as
other covenants which may restrict, among other things, the Company s ability to pay dividends, complete merger, acquisition
or similar transactions, make certain capital expenditures, incur certain operating lease expenses, and repurchase shares of its
Common Stock. 

The balance of the Cash Consideration paid
by the Company at the closing of the WSD acquisition was funded by the $6,000,000 of proceeds received by the Company in connection
with its issuance and sale in a Private Placement Transaction of 1,290,323 shares of its Common Stock for a total purchase price
of $6,000,000. See Note 10,  Subsequent Events , to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item
1 of this Report for additional information regarding the Private Placement Transaction and the WSD acquisition. 

- 13 - 

       Index   

The Company believes that its existing cash,
cash equivalents, net cash from operations, and funds available under the 2016 Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund its operations
and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. The Company may also seek to raise additional funds through
issuances of equity and/or debt securities and/or the incurrence of additional secured or unsecured indebtedness, including in
connection with acquisitions or other transactions consummated by the Company as part of its buy-and-build growth strategy. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing  

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company
did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 

  Results of Operations  

  Revenues  

Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal
2017 increased by approximately $3.3 million (53.3%) from the same period of fiscal 2016. The increase in sales is primarily attributable
to a large number of sales made at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which included certain large orders, and lower
sales numbers in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to delays in shipments. 

 Revenues from license fees, commissions
and other income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by approximately $51,300 (74.2%) compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a reduction in license fees. 

   Operating expenses   

Costs of sales, expressed as a percentage
of net sales, increased to 78.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 77.9% for the same period of fiscal 2016. The small decrease
in margins was attributable to product mix. 

 Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased by approximately $272,000 (23.0%) in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the first quarter of fiscal
2016, mostly due to higher commission expenses associated with an increase in sales and non-recurring charges associated with the
acquisition of WSD. Expressed as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 15.4% during
the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 19.0% for the same period of fiscal 2016. The  

- 14 - 

       Index   

decrease was attributable to the absorption
of these expenses over increased revenues generated by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 

 The change in interest income for the
first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was immaterial. 

  The
Company s effective income tax rate was 37.8% for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

  Inf l ation  

 Inflation did not have a significant
effect on the Company s operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

  Transactions with Related Parties  

 The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary,
Steiner-Atlantic, leases 27,000 square feet of warehouse and office space from an affiliate of Michael S. Steiner, a director and
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, pursuant to a lease agreement dated November 1, 2014. Under
the lease, which has a term of three years, monthly base rental payments were $10,275 during the first year of the lease and are
$10,580 during the second year of the lease and $10,900 during the third year of the lease. In addition to base rent, Steiner-Atlantic
is responsible under the lease for costs related to real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, repairs and insurance. Payments
under this lease totaled approximately $34,000 and $33,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

See also Note 10,  Subsequent Events ,
to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report for a description of the Private
Placement Transaction between the Company and an affiliate of Henry M. Nahmad, the Company s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer
and President, which was consummated in connection with the WSD acquisition during October 2016 and the lease which a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company entered into in connection with the WSD acquisition during October 2016 with an affiliate of Dennis Mack
and Tom Marks, the two members of WSD. Each of Mr. Mack and Mr. Marks was appointed to serve as Executive Vice President of the
Company in connection with the WSD acquisition during October 2016. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

The accounting policies that the Company has
identified as critical to its business operations and to an understanding of the Company s financial statements remain unchanged
from those described in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section
of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. In connection with the preparation of
the Company s financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions, including those that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reported period. Estimates and assumptions made may not prove to be correct, and actual results may differ from the estimates. 

Recently Issued Accounting Guidance  

 See Note 7, to the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report for a description of  Recently Issued Accounting Guidance  

  Forward Looking Statements  

- 15 - 

       Index   

Certain statements in this Report are  forward
looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report,
words such as  may,   should,   seek,   believe,   expect,   anticipate, 
 estimate,   project,   intend,   strategy  and similar expressions are intended
to identify forward looking statements regarding events, conditions and financial trends that may affect future plans, operations,
business strategies, operating results and financial position of the Company. Forward looking statements are subject to a number
of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, trends, performance or achievements of the Company,
or industry trends and results, to differ materially from the future results, trends, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by such forward looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, those associated with: general
economic and business conditions in the United States and other countries in which the Company s customers and suppliers
are located; industry conditions and trends; technology changes; competition and other factors which may affect prices which the
Company may charge for its products and its profit margins; the availability and cost of inventory purchased by the Company; the
relative value of the United States dollar to currencies in the countries in which the Company s customers, suppliers and
competitors are located; changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulation, including environmental regulations;
the Company s ability to implement changes in its business strategies and development plans; the availability, terms and
deployment of debt and equity capital if needed for expansion or otherwise; risks relating to the timing of shipments of customers 
orders and the Company s recognition of revenue relating thereto; risks and uncertainties associated with the Company s
buy-and-build growth strategy, including that the Company may not be successful in identifying or consummating acquisitions or
other strategic opportunities, that the potential benefits of acquisitions (including the recent acquisition of WSD) may not be
realized to the extent anticipated or at all, integration risks, risks related to indebtedness incurred in connection acquisitions
(including the indebtedness incurred in connection with the recent acquisition of WSD), dilution experienced by the Company s
stockholders as a result of shares issued by the Company in connection with acquisitions and the financing of acquisitions (including
the recent acquisition of WSD), and risks related to the business, operations and prospects of acquired companies (including Western
State Design); and other economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other risks and factors discussed in the Company s
filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, those disclosed in the  Risk Factors  section of the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Many of these risks and factors are beyond the Company s
control. In addition, past performance and perceived trends may not be indicative of future results. The Company cautions that
the foregoing factors are not exclusive. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 

Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

 The Company s indebtedness may
subject the Company to interest rate risk. Interest rates are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic
and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve.
The nature and timing of any changes in such policies or general economic conditions and the effect they may have on the Company
are unpredictable. The Company s indebtedness may also have other important impacts on the Company, including that the Company
will be required to utilize cash flow to service the debt, indebtedness may make the Company more vulnerable to economic downturns,
and indebtedness may subject the Company to covenants or restrictions on its operations and activities or on its ability to pay
dividends or take other actions. 

 All of the Company s export sales
require the customer to make payment in United States dollars. Accordingly, foreign sales may be affected by the strength of the
United States dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which the Company s customers are located, as well as
the strength of the economies of the countries in which the Company s customers are located. The Company has, at times in

- 16 - 

       Index   

the past, paid certain suppliers in Euros. The Company had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 30, 2016 or June
30, 2016. 

 The Company s cash and cash equivalents
are maintained in a checking bank account and a money market account which bear interest at prevailing interest rates. At September
30, 2016 bank deposits exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. 

    Item 4. Controls and
Procedures.  

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

 As of the end of the period covered
by this Report, management of the Company, with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based
on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016,
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. It should be noted that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required
to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. 

  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the period covered by this Report,
there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

    PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION  

    Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

 There have been no material changes
with respect to the Company s legal proceedings from those disclosed in the  Legal Proceedings  section of the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

    Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

 There have been no material changes
in the risks and uncertainties that the Company faces from those disclosed in the  Risk Factors  section of the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.
