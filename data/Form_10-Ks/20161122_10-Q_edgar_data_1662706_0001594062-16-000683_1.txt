Note 1   Description of business and basis of presentation  

Organization and nature of business  

Trupal Media, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as  we ,  us ,  our , or  the Company ) has developed a platform for casino-game play in a social media environment.  We were incorporated in the State of Florida on March 14, 2014.  We are headquartered in Miami Beach, Florida and our contracted software development, marketing and implementation providers are based in Peru. The Company launched its flagship social gaming application,    on April 1, 2014. We license over 50 casino based games presently on our social media platform. To date, Cleo s Casino has had a good response by players as shown through its high player retention rate and increasing number of new and returning users. Trupal Media, Inc. is focused on delivering high quality gaming platforms, maintaining low costs and driving a rigorous marketing campaign that will ensure steady growth and value for the Company and its shareholders. 

On May 6, 2015 the Company s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the articles of incorporation to increase to the authorized share capital from 10,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 common shares. The effect of this action has been retroactively impacted in these financial statements. 

On July 13, 2016, the Company s Form S-1 Registration Statement received a notice of effect from the Securities and Exchange commission. The Company is presently pursuing a listing on OTC Markets as well as additional funding as may be required to fully execute its plan of operations.  

Financial Statements Presented 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 210 8-03 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Operating results for the six months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.  For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s registration statement on Form S-1/A as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2016. 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Fiscal year end:  The Company has selected March 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Functional currency:  The Company s functional currency is the United States Dollar. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

TRUPAL MEDIA, INC. 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of reporting within the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all cash on hand, cash accounts not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. 

Revenue Recognition 

We derive revenue from the sale of virtual goods associated with our online games, as well as from services provided for customer events. All sales are recorded in accordance with ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition.   Revenue is recognized when all the criteria have been met: 

When persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. 

The services have been provided to the customer. 

The fee is fixed or determinable. 

Collectability is reasonably assured. 

Online Game 

We operate our flagship social gaming application  Cleo s Casino . Cleo s Casino is available on Facebook. Cleo Casino generates revenue through the sale of virtual currency to players that they may exchange to play at any of our licensed online slot machines, video poker machines, Hold em style poker tables, or for other features and experiences available within Cleo Casino. Players can pay for our virtual currency using Facebook credits or Facebook local currency payments when playing our games through Facebook and can use other payment methods such as credit cards or PayPal on other platforms. 

Revenue from the sale of virtual currency to players is recognized when the service has been provided to the player, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We have determined that an implied obligation exists by the Company to the paying player to continue displaying the purchased virtual goods within the online game over their estimated life or until they are consumed. We recognize revenue upon the sale of the game credits to the customer, and receive such amounts from the payment processor within a period of 30 days from the sale to the customer. 

Cost of Revenue 

Our cost of revenue consists primarily of the direct expenses incurred in order to generate revenue. Such costs are recorded as incurred. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of virtual good transaction fees paid to platform operators such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple and content licensing fees, all of which are expensed as commissions.  We also incur hosting fees and server rental fees.  We also record costs related to the fulfillment of specific customer advertising campaigns. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Company s financial instruments consist of cash, receivables, payables, and due to related party. The carrying amount of cash, receivables and payables approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. The carrying amount of the notes payable approximates fair value as the individual borrowings bear interest at market interest rates.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  

Research and Development And Capitalized Software Development Costs 

Research and development expenses with respect to the Company s online gaming platform including consulting services, internal costs for payroll, overhead and related expenses of its technology development and other employees directly involved in the application development are charged to expense as incurred in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86 ("SFAS No. 86"), Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.  While the Company has launched its application, has determined technological feasibility and is generating revenues from the sale of virtual currency, due to the limited cash flow to date, the Company does not yet consider it has reached the threshold for economic feasibility.  All software development costs have therefore been expensed upon completion of management s impairment analysis at fiscal year-end. As the Company has achieved technological feasibility the Company intends to capitalize ongoing application software and development costs. Amortization of any capitalized software development costs will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the software, which the Company has determined to be 36 months. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

Loss per Common Share 

In accordance with ASC Topic 280    Earnings Per Share , the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  The following potential common shares have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the three months ended June 30, 2016 because the effect would have been anti-dilutive: 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  

Note 3   Going Concern 

The Company has incurred net losses since inception and had a working capital deficit of $612,571 at September 30, 2016 ($497,480 at March 31, 2016).  These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects cash flows from operating activities to improve, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue, although there can be no assurance thereof. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our business and expansion plans.

Trupal Media Inc. is a social-casino-game publisher, incorporated in the State of Florida on March 14, 2014. We operate in the gaming content delivery business. The Company launched its flagship social gaming app  Cleo s Casino  on April 1, 2014. Cleo s Casino which is available on Facebook, is an ancient Egyptian themed app that offers 5 slot games per room, with each room being themed around the life story of Cleopatra. Users download the app and purchase virtual coins from the Company to play the various games in the app. Each user plays the first slot game of each room trying to achieve objectives in order to unlock the next slot game in a progressive fashion. A  User  or  Player  is a person who has downloaded the application, signed in and made use of the games. Playing the slots using purchased virtual coins allows users to earn additional virtual coins to extend play.  Slot tournaments have been added to the app for players to compete against each other and win additional virtual coins.  Trupal generates revenue as the users purchase virtual coins in order to commence and continue game play. Since inception, Trupal has integrated more than 40 slot games and slot tournaments.  The Company s ability to become profitable is dependent on our ability to market to a wider audience and thereby generate continuous in app purchases from a broad user base accelerating the purchase of virtual currency for use in our games. 

Other than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the Notes to our Financial Statements, included herein. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early application permitted. The standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The new guidance will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Under existing accounting guidance, tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies arising from the vesting of share-based payments are recorded in additional paid-in-capital. The new guidance will require such benefits or deficiencies to be recognized as income tax benefits or expenses in the statement of operations.  Companies are required to apply the new guidance prospectively. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires the lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, the Company is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Further, the lease requires a finance lease to recognize both an interest expense and an amortization of the associated expense. Operating leases generally recognize the associated expense on a straight line basis. ASU 2016-02 requires the Company to adopt the standard using a modified retrospective approach and adoption beginning on January 1, 2019. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This new standard provides guidance on how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value. This standard requires that entities measure certain equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. 

The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

As of the end of the quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.

We have engaged an outside consultant to assist in adopting new measures to improve upon our internal controls. Future controls, among other things, will include more checks and balances and communication strategies between the management and the board to ensure efficient and effective oversight over company activities as well as more stringent accounting policies to track and update our financial reporting.
