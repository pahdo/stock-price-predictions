N  ote 1.    
 
   Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies    

  Nature of Business   
 Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company ) was organized in the State of Delaware as a limited liability company on June 2, 2006 to operate as a diagnostic services company. The Company provides   integrated diagnostic   consultations,   information   services   and personalized   medicine   services   tailored   to the   patients   of its referring   physicians,   hospitals   and hospital   systems.   The Company also provides research services to pharmaceutical companies and other research entities. The Company s operations consist of one reportable segment.  
 The Company operates in a highly regulated industry. The manner in which licensed physicians can organize to perform and bill for medical services is governed by state laws and regulations. Businesses like the Company often are not permitted to employ physicians or to own corporations that employ physicians or to otherwise exercise control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians.  
 In states where the Company is not permitted to directly own a medical services provider or for other commercial reasons, it performs only non-medical administrative and support services, does not represent to the public or its clients that it offers medical services and does not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine. In those states, the Company conducts business through entities that it controls, and it is these affiliated entities that employ the physicians who practice medicine. In such states, the Company generally enters into a contract that restricts the owners of the affiliated entity from transferring their ownership interests in the affiliated entity and otherwise provides the Company or its designee with a controlling voting or financial interest in the affiliated entity and its laboratory operations. This controlling financial interest generally is obtained pursuant to a long-term management services agreement between the Company and the affiliated entity. Under the management services agreement, the Company exclusively manages all aspects of the operation other than the provision of medical services. Generally, the affiliated entity has no operating assets because the Company acquired all of its operating assets at the time it acquired the related laboratory operations. In accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, these affiliated entities are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements of Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC.  
 The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 of Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC, and the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and related footnotes that would normally be required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial reporting. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of a normal and recurring nature) that management considers necessary for a fair statement of financial information for the interim periods. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2016.  
  Working Capital  
 The Company requires significant cash flow to service its debt obligations. Reductions in reimbursement from Medicare and other payors in recent years have had a significant negative impact on the Company s cash flows. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $30.0 million available under its revolving credit facility for general operations. The Company may not achieve all of its business goals and objectives and events beyond its control could affect its ability to meet financial tests and ratios under the Company s credit facility and limit its ability to access the amounts otherwise available under its revolving credit facility.

    Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable   
 The Company recognizes revenue at the time services are performed. Unbilled receivables are recorded for services rendered during, but billed subsequent to, the reporting period. Revenue is reported at the estimated realizable amounts from patients, third-party payors and others for services rendered. Revenue under certain third-party payor agreements is subject to audit and retroactive adjustments. Provisions for estimated third-party payor settlements and adjustments are estimated in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. The provision for doubtful accounts and the related allowance are adjusted periodically based upon an evaluation of historical collection experience with specific payors for particular services, anticipated collection levels with specific payors for new services, industry reimbursement trends, and other relevant factors. Changes in these factors in future periods could result in increases or decreases in the Company s provision for doubtful accounts and impact its results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
  Recent Accounting Standards Updates   
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. The Company has not yet selected a transition method under ASU 2014-09. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).  The amendments in ASU 2016-08 affect ASU 2014-09 and are related to the principal versus agent considerations implementation guidance in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  The amendments in ASU 2016-10 clarify the following two aspects in ASU 2014-09: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11,  Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting.  The amendments in ASU 2016-11 rescinded certain SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified, effective upon the adoption of ASU 2014-09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  The amendments in ASU 2016-12 address certain issues identified in ASU 2014-09 in the guidance on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, non-cash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. These ASU s are effective concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2014-09. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of these updates on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.   Under the new guidance, management will be required to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows and the Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption on our related disclosures. 
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this standards update.  The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. An entity should apply the guidance either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative adjustment at the date of the initial application. In connection with the Company s adoption of ASU 2015-03, the deferred debt issue costs related to the issuance of the Company s Senior Notes, as further described in Note 6, and term loans were reclassified to long-term debt.  The net unamortized deferred debt issue costs reflected in long-term debt were approximately $4.1 million and $5.6 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Deferred debt issue costs related to the Company s revolving credit facility continue to be reflected as non-current assets in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.

    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases    (topic 842)  .   The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among orga  nizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods wi  thin those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this update on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which amends Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation.  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company s fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this update on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued  ASU  No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . ASU 2016-13 introduces a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities, which will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expands disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning the first quarter of 2020 with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied using the modified-retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements  and related disclosures .  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued  ASU  No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which  clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU  No. 2016-15  is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 with early adoption permitted and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-13 on the  presentation and classification of the Company s statements of cash flows.

 Acquisitions    

 The Company has made strategic acquisitions of local laboratories to achieve greater economies of scale and expand or augment its geographic presence.    
  2015 Acquisitions  
 On July 15, 2015, the Company acquired the assets of two pathology practices and a billing service, all located in Texas. On October 29, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the equity of a pathology practice in Ohio. The Company paid a combined total of $15.4 million of cash in the aggregate at closing for the two acquisitions and issued contingent notes payable over from three to six years. Payments under the contingent notes will be paid annually, up to a maximum of $11.9 million over the term of the notes, subject to the retention of certain key facility contracts, future financial results and the cash received under specified client contracts. The Company used cash available under its $25.0 million delayed draw term loan to pay the $15.4 million cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisitions.  
  2016 Acquisitions   
 On March 31, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the equity of a hospital-based pathology practice located in Oregon. On April 8, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the equity of a second hospital-based pathology practice in Florida. In connection with these 2016 acquisitions, the Company paid total net cash of $7.2 million and issued contingent notes payable over three years. Payments under the contingent notes will be paid annually, up to a maximum of $1.5 million over the term of the notes, subject to the future financial performance of the acquired practice and the retention of a key facility contract. The Company used cash available under its $40.0 million delayed draw term loan B to pay the $7.2 million cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition.

    The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated aggregate fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities a  ssumed in connection with the 2016 acquisitions (in thousands):  

Intangible assets acquired as the result of a business combination are recognized at fair value as an asset apart from goodwill if the asset arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is separable. The Company s intangible assets, which principally consist of the fair value of customer relationships, health care facility agreements and key physician agreements acquired in connection with the acquisition of diagnostic companies, are capitalized and amortized on the straight-line method over their useful life, which generally ranges from 3 to 15 years.  The Company s preliminary estimate is that approximately $2.1 million of goodwill recognized in the 2016 acquisitions will be deductible over 15 years for federal income tax purposes.  
                                      Pro-forma information (unaudited)  
 The accompanying historical condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions from the date acquired through September 30, 2016. The 2015 and 2016 acquisitions contributed $7.2 million and $19.5 million of revenue for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $1.4 million and $3.5 million of net income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The July 15, 2015 acquisitions contributed revenue of $2.9 million and net income of $0.6 million for both of the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
       The following unaudited pro forma information presents the consolidated results of the Company s operations and the results of the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, after giving effect to amortization, depreciation, income tax, and the reduced level of certain specific operating expenses (primarily compensation and related expenses attributable to former owners) as if the 2015 acquisitions had been consummated on January 1, 2014 and the 2016 acquisitions had been consummated on January 1, 2015. Such unaudited pro forma information is based on historical unaudited financial information with respect to the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions and does not include operational or other changes which might have been effected by the Company. The unaudited pro forma information for the three and nine months ended September 30,       2016 and 2015 presented below is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of results which would have been achieved or results which may be achieved in the future (in thousands):

Note 6.    
 
 Long-Term Debt      

 On December 20, 2010, the Company issued $200.0 million in unsecured senior notes that mature on January 15, 2018, which are referred to as the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 10.75%, which is payable each January 15 and July 15. In accordance with the Senior Notes indenture, the Company is subject to certain limitations on issuing additional debt and is required to submit quarterly and annual financial reports. The Senior Notes are currently redeemable at the Company s option at 102.688% of par, plus accrued interest. The redemption price decreases to 100% of par on January 15, 2017. The Senior Notes rank equally in right of repayment with all of the Company s other senior indebtedness, but are subordinated to the Company s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness.  
 On July 31, 2014, the Company entered into a $220.0 million senior secured credit facility with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC. The credit facility consists of a $165.0 million initial term loan, $30.0 million revolving credit line and $25.0 million delayed draw term loan. Prior to the amendments discussed below, the delayed draw term loan facility was available through July 31, 2015 to pay the consideration for acquisitions, as permitted under the credit facility, including acquisition related fees and expenses. The Company used $145.6 million of the $165.0 million proceeds to retire a previous revolving credit facility due May 2015 and term loan facility due May 2016, including accrued interest and fees.   
 Each of the term loan, revolving credit line and delayed draw term loan under the credit facility has a maturity of five years but is subject to a maturity date of October 14, 2017 if the Senior Notes are not refinanced or their maturity is not extended prior to such date. Under the outstanding term loans, quarterly principal repayments of $0.5 million became due commencing September 30, 2015 and continuing through December 31, 2016. Quarterly principal repayments increase to $0.9 million on March 31, 2017 through June 30, 2018 and to $1.3 million on September 30, 2018 and each quarter end thereafter, with the balance due at maturity. As of September 30, 2016, the balance outstanding under the initial term loan was $162.5 million and the balance outstanding under the delayed draw term loans was $35.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding and the Company had $30.0 million available under its revolving credit facility.   
 The proceeds under the credit facility were reduced by discounts of $5.1 million. Additionally, the Company used $3.9 million of the proceeds to pay issuance costs in connection with the credit facility. The remaining $10.4 million balance of the proceeds under the credit facility initial term loan and the funds available under the $30.0 million revolving credit line were intended to be used to execute future acquisitions and for the Company s general working capital and operational needs.   
 Prior to the second amendment executed on April 10, 2015 discussed below, at the Company s option, interest under the credit facility was at LIBOR, with a 1.25% floor, plus 7%, or at a base rate, with a 2.25% floor, plus 6%.  
 On April 10, 2015, the Company entered into a second amendment to the credit facility. The second amendment to the credit facility added a $40 million delayed draw term loan B facility which was available through April 10, 2016, which was subsequently extended to April 25, 2016 pursuant to a fifth amendment to the credit facility, to pay consideration for acquisitions, as permitted under the credit facility, including acquisition related fees and expenses.  The Company borrowed $10.0 million in March 2016 and the $30.0 million of unused availability under the delayed draw term loan B facility expired on April 25, 2016. The second amendment also increased the interest rate under the credit facility to LIBOR, with a 1.25% floor, plus 7.125%, or to the base rate, with a 2.25% floor, plus 6.125%.

    In connection with the acquisitions consummated by the Company on July 15, 2015, the Company borrowed the remaining $15.3 million available under the delayed draw term loan. The amount borrowed exceeded the total paid by the Company for eligible acq  uisitions, inclusive of related expenses, by $5.4 million. The Company entered into third and fourth amendments to its credit facility that extended the period in which the Company was able to use the remaining $5.4 million availability under the $25.0 mil  lion delayed draw term loan from July 31, 2015, to October 31, 2015. The Company used the remaining $5.4 million for an acquisition completed on October 29, 2015.  
 The credit facility is secured by essentially all of the Company s assets and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain of the Company s existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries and is subject to certain financial covenants.The credit facility requires the Company to maintain certain levels of liquidity and comply on a quarterly basis with certain financial covenants, including a leverage ratio calculation, which generally becomes more restrictive over time, and an interest coverage ratio. Also, on an annual basis the Company must not exceed a specified maximum amount of consolidated capital expenditures. In addition, the credit facility includes negative covenants restricting or limiting the Company s ability to, among other things, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees; incur liens and engage in sale leaseback transactions; make loans and investments; declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock; engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations; prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness; amend or otherwise alter terms of its indebtedness; sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates and alter the business it conducts without prior approval of the lenders.

Note 10.    
 
 Commitments and Contingencies     

 During the ordinary course of business, the Company has become and may in the future become subject to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings. The Company may have liability with respect to its employees and its pathologists. Medical malpractice claims are generally covered by insurance. While the Company believes the outcome of any such pending legal actions and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, if the Company is ultimately found liable under any medical malpractice claims, there can be no assurance the Company s medical malpractice insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any such liability. The Company had accrued approximately $2.0 million and $2.2 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, for future medical malpractice claims.   
 The Company may also, from time to time, be involved with legal actions related to the acquisition of and affiliation with physician practices, the prior conduct of such practices, or the employment (and restriction on competition) of its physicians. There can be no assurance any costs or liabilities for which the Company becomes responsible in connection with such claims or actions will not be material or will not exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of the indemnifying parties. Certain sellers have asserted the Company owes an aggregate of $2.7 million in connection with a contingent note issued in an acquisition. The Company has asserted the sellers owe the Company a repayment of $2.8 million. The Company s management believes its calculations are correct, but at this time cannot estimate what additional amount will ultimately be paid or recovered, if any, in connection with these contingent notes.  
 In January 2016, the Company vacated two of its leased facilities.  The Company has not reached a settlement with the landlord of one of the leased facilities and recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 for the abandoned leasehold improvements and to accrue the present value of the future lease payments stipulated under the lease agreement. 
 - 16 - 
 
    In August 2015, the   Company received a notice of non-compliance for payroll tax withholding related to a reorganization of two of its subsidiaries during 2011.  The Company believes its Form 941 filings for these subsidiaries in 2011 were appropriate and formally appealed app  roximately $0.5 million of additional taxes, interest and penalties accessed by the IRS in November 2015.  The Company cannot currently determine whether or not its appeal will be successful. If the Company s appeal is unsuccessful, it may incur a charge o  f approximately $0.5 million for the additional taxes, interest and penalties.  
 During 2011, the Company received claims of overpayments from the U.S. Veterans Administration, or VA, for a total of $1.6 million. In August 2015, the Company and the VA entered into a final settlement, under which the Company will pay $1.2 million to the VA in twelve monthly installments of $100,000. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded an accrued liability for the settlement of $0.8 million. As of September 30, 2016 the settlement had been paid in full.   
  Contingent Notes   
 As discussed in Note 7, in connection with certain of its acquisitions, the Company agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods based upon the attainment of stipulated levels of operating results by each of the acquired entities, as defined in their respective agreements. The computation of the annual operating results is subject to review and approval by the sellers prior to payment. In the event there is a dispute, the Company will pay the undisputed amount and then take reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute with the sellers. If the sellers are successful in asserting their dispute, the Company could be required to make additional payments in future periods.     
 Future payments under contingent notes will be made if the practices achieve stipulated levels of results and contract retention as outlined in their respective agreements. Any future payments of contingent consideration will be reflected in the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions was $12.0 million, representing the present value of approximately $16.1 million in estimated future payments through 2021.  
  Purchase Obligations   
 The Company has entered into non-cancelable commitments to purchase reagents and other laboratory supplies. Under these agreements, the Company must purchase minimum amounts of reagents and other laboratory supplies through 2021.  
 At September 30, 2016, the remaining minimum purchase commitments are as follows: 

In connection with certain of these commitments, the Company received lab testing equipment, to which the Company has either received title, or will receive title upon fulfillment of its purchase obligations under the respective commitment. The Company recorded the obligation under purchase commitment for the fair market value of the equipment, reduced by the cash paid. The remaining obligations under purchase commitments included in other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets were $1.5 million and $1.6 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

  Recurring Fair Value Measurements   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions was $12.0 million and $13.1 million, respectively. The fair value of contingent consideration is derived using valuation techniques that incorporate unobservable inputs and are considered Level 3 items. The Company utilizes a present value of estimated future payments approach to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration. Estimates for fair value of contingent consideration primarily involve two inputs, which are (i) the projections of the financial performance of the acquired practices that are used to calculate the amount of the payments and (ii) the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future payments. Changes in either of these inputs will impact the estimated fair value of contingent consideration. At September 30, 2016 the discount rates ranged from 14% to 19%.

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements   
 Certain assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are adjusted to fair value only when the carrying values are greater than their fair values. The Company completed its latest annual impairment evaluations as of November 30, 2015 and recorded write-offs of goodwill to reflect the then current estimated fair value of the impaired reporting units. The fair values were derived with fair value models utilizing unobservable inputs that therefore are considered Level 3 items.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short maturity of these instruments. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of the Company s debt was $357.7 million and $332.1 million, respectively. The Company uses quoted market prices and yields for the same or similar types of borrowings in active markets when available to determine the fair value of the Company s debt. These fair values are considered Level 2 items.

The Company is a Delaware limited liability company. For federal income tax purposes, the Company is treated as a partnership. Accordingly, the Company is generally not subject to income taxes and the income attributable to the limited liability company is distributed to the members in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement. However, certain of the Company s subsidiaries are structured as corporations and therefore are subject to federal and state income taxes. The provision for income taxes for these subsidiaries is reflected in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and includes federal and state taxes currently payable and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to acquisitions. The provision for federal and state taxes was $0.6 million and $10,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The benefit for federal and state taxes was $0.5 million and $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 Guarantor Subsidiaries    

 The following information is presented as required by regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Company s 10.75% Senior Notes due 2018. This information is not routinely prepared for use by management. The operating and investing activities of the separate legal entities included in the Company s consolidated financial statements are fully interdependent and integrated. Accordingly, consolidating the operating results of those separate legal entities is not representative of what the actual operating results of those entities would be on a stand-alone basis. Operating expenses of those separate legal entities include intercompany charges for management fees and other services. Certain expense items that are applicable to the Company s subsidiaries are typically recorded in the books and records of Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC. For purposes of this footnote disclosure, such balances and amounts have been  pushed down  to the respective subsidiaries either on a specific identification basis, or when such items cannot be specifically attributed to an individual subsidiary, have been allocated on an incremental or proportional cost basis to Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC and the Company s subsidiaries.  
 The following tables present consolidating financial information as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for (i) Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC, (ii) on a combined basis, the subsidiaries of the Company that are guarantors of the Company s Senior Notes (the  Subsidiary Guarantors ) and (iii) on a combined basis, the subsidiaries of the Company that are not guarantors of the Company s Senior Notes (the  Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries ). For presentation in the following tables, Subsidiary Guarantors includes revenue and expenses and assets and liabilities for those subsidiaries directly or indirectly 100% owned by the Company, including those entities that have contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups. Essentially, all property and equipment reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets collateralize the Company s credit facility. As such, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $ 2.1  million and $2.2 million, respectively, of property and equipment held by Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries are reflected under Subsidiary Guarantors in the following tables.

 Overview 
 We are   a leading   independent   pathology   services   and cancer   diagnostics   company.   We provide   integrated diagnostic   consultations,   information   services   and personalized   medicine   services   tailored   to the   patients   of our referring   physicians,   hospitals   and hospital   systems.   We also   provide   research   services   to pharmaceutical companies   and other   research   entities.   Our highly-traine d , subspecialized   pathologists   deliver   comprehensive diagnostic   opinions   of a patient s   condition   and work collaboratively   with referring   physicians   to determine appropriate   treatments.   We have established   long-standing   relationships   with our referring   physicians   as a result of our locally   provided   diagnostic   services,   frequent   diagnostic   consultations   and flexible   IT solutions   that   are customizable   to our clients    needs.   Our client - centered   approach   to providing   diagnostic   services   is   driven   by our belief   that   the   practice   of medicine   and the   delivery   of healthcare   are   both personal   and best   delivered   locally. 
 Through organic   growth and a series   of strategic   acquisitions,   we have achieved   a large   geographic   footprint   and a leading   presence   in our local   markets.   As of September 30, 2016, we operated   26 community-based   pathology practices   with over 160 board-certified   pathologists   on staf f , and our clients   included   over   13,000 referring physicians   and 99 hospitals   across   45 states.   Our referring   physicians   include   dermatologists,   obstetricians   and gynecologists,   family   practitioners,   gastroenterologists,   urologists,   general   surgeons   and oncologists.   We also serve   as laboratory   medical   director   for   362 laboratory   sites   across   the   country,   including   our 99 hospital   clients, reflecting the recent addition of two new hospital clients in the Northeast and one on the West Coast. 
 In 2013, we established  the  Aurora Research Institute ( ARI ), a revenue-generating   services   platform   that   leverages   the   expertise   of our pathologists,   laboratory   resources   and sizeable   library   of biospecimens   for   the   development   of therapeutics   and companion   diagnostics   for   leading   global   pharmaceutical   and biotechnology   companie s . For the   year   ended December   31, 2015, ARI contributed   net   revenue   of $3.5 million,   or approximately   1.3% of our total   net   revenue. 
 For the   year   ended December   31, 2015 and the   nine months   ended September 30, 2016, we processed   approximately 2.1 million   and 1.6 million accessions,   respectively.   An accession   may   include   one or more   specimens   received   by our pathology   practices   originated   from   a single   patient   visit   to a referring   physician   concerning   a particular condition.   For the   year   ended December   31, 2015 and the   nine months   ended September 30, 2016, we generated   net revenue   of $263.7 million   and $214.8 million,   respectively. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 Services Mix 
 An important   factor   affecting   our financial   performance   is   the   impact   of changes   in our services   mix,   including the   conversion   of global   fee   arrangements   to technical   component   or professional   component   arrangements   and changes   in the   accession   volume   across   our various   subspecialties.   Under a global   fee   arrangemen t , we provide both technical   and professional   service s . The technical   component   represents   the   cost   of preparing   a specimen   for interpretatio n , while   the   professional   component   represents   the   cost   of supervision   and interpretation   by our pathologists.   We generally   prefer   global   fee   arrangements   in which we provide   both the   professional   and technical   services   component s , as opposed to arrangements   where we only perform   either   technical   or professional   services,   because   global   arrangements   result   in higher   revenue   per   accessio n . Additionally,   changes  in test     volume     across     our various     subspecialties     can impact     our revenue.     For example,     molecular     testing, hematopathology,     dermatopathology,     gastrointestinal     and genitourinary     all     have higher     revenue     per     accession than     women s     health     pathology     services     and clinical     tests.     Women s     health     services     and clinical     tests     generally have lower     revenue     per     accession.     Therefore,     increases     in the   percentage     of accessions     related     to women s     health pathology     services     relative     to the   percentage  s     of accessions     generated     by other     subspecialties     would generally decrease     our average     revenue     per     accession.     Conversely,     a higher     volume     of molecular     testing     would generally increase     our average     revenue     per     accession.

    Payor Mix  
 Changes in our payor   mix,   as well   as changes   in the   payors   used by our referring   physicians,   can affect   our revenue   per   accession   and impact   our financial   results.   We generally   provide   services   on an in-network   basis, where we perform   services   for   patients   within   the   networks   of payors   with which we have contracts.   Services performed   on an out-of-network   basis   comprised   approximately   10% of our 2015 revenue.   Our payors   include governmental   payors,   such as Medicare   and Medicaid;   private   insurance,   including   managed   care   organizations and commercial   payors;   and private   payors,   such as physicians   and individual   patients.   Because   we are   generally obligated   to bill   for   our services   in the   specific   manner   prescribed   by each   payor,   who may   each   have different billing   requirements,   these   differences   can impact   our financial   results.   Therefore,   if   more   of our referring physicians   use governmental   payors   who have historically   had lower   reimbursement   rates   as opposed to commercial   payors   who have historically   had higher   reimbursement   rates,   our revenue   per   accession   may decrease.   For the   year   ended December   31, 2015, based   on cash   collections,   we estimate   approximately   58% of our revenue   was paid   by private   insurance,   including   managed   care   organizations   and commercial   payors; approximately   22% of our revenue   was paid   by Medicare;   approximately   2% of our revenue   was paid   by Medicaid;   and approximately   18% was paid   by physicians   and individual   patients.  
 Reimbursement Rates 
 Changes to the reimbursement rates paid by our payors impact our net revenue per accession. When we bill our services to third party payors and uninsured patients, we use a company-generated fee schedule that is generally set at billing rates that are higher than our anticipated reimbursement rates. Our billings for services to third party payors are then reimbursed in accordance with the set or negotiated reimbursement rates of the applicable payor. On the other hand, when we bill our services to physicians, which are not reimbursed by third party payors, we use a negotiated fee schedule, and when we bill Medicare for specialized diagnostic services, we are subject to a Medicare physician fee schedule and, to a lesser degree, a clinical laboratory fee schedule, both of which are updated annually. Our revenue is recorded net of the estimated differences between the amount billed in accordance with the prescribed fee schedule and the estimated payment to be received from third party payors, including Medicare. As a result, any changes to the reimbursements rates for our services or the fee schedules at which we bill our services will impact our financial results. We have historically faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure on reimbursement rates as government payors and private insurers take steps to control the cost, use and delivery of health care services, including diagnostic testing services. Government regulations can impact our reimbursement rates and financial results. 
 On November 2, 2016, the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services (CMS) issued its 2017 Physician Fee Schedule, which we refer to as the 2017 Fee Schedule.  In the 2017 Fee Schedule, CMS effectuated reductions to CPT Code 88305, which is the CPT Code we bill most frequently, of approximately 6.8%. Reimbursement rates for flow cytometry codes were also reduced by approximately 19%.  Based on our current level of reimbursement from Medicare, we estimate the changes to the 2017 Fee Schedule would result in a reduction of our annualized Medicare revenue of approximately $3.3 million.  
 In addition, we are currently in negotiation with a regional private insurance company that has notified us of their intent to reduce their reimbursement for our services.  At this time, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these negotiations. 
 In response to the reductions by CMS, as well as potential reductions from private insurance companies, we have undertaken a program to increase efficiencies and reduce costs, including a reduction in our staffing.  We estimate the implementation of this program, which is expected to be fully implemented by January 1, 2017, will reduce our expenses by approximately $3.9 million annually.  
 Acquisitions 
 Since   our formation   in 2006, we have acquired   31 diagnostic   services   companies   throughout   the   United   States.   As a result   of the   significant   number   and size   of our acquisitions,   many   of the   changes   in our consolidated   results of operations   and financial   position   discussed   from   period   to period   reflect   revenue   generated   by the   businesses we have acquired   and costs   related   to these   acquisitions. For additional   information   relating   to recent acquisitions,   see     Recent   Acquisitions.  
 Seasonality 
 Our results   are   also   affected   by seasonal   trends   and generally   decline   during   the   summer,   winter   and holiday periods.   Furthermore,   our results   are   subject   to declines   due to weather   conditions,   such as severe   snow storms and flooding   or excessively   hot or cold   spells,   as well   as general   economic   conditions,   which can deter   patients from   visiting   hospitals   and our referring   physicians.   Seasonal   fluctuations   tend   to vary   by region,   and, for example,   we experience   a greater   decrease   in our accession   volume   during   the   winter   months   in the   northeast   as compared   to the   southeast.   In addition,   we tend   to experience   a decrease   in our accession   volume   at   the beginning   of each   year   as a result   of the   annual   reset   of health   plan   deductibles.

    Emerging Growth Company   
 We qualify as an  emerging growth company  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act). As an emerging growth company, we have elected to provide reduced reporting and are not subject to other obligations generally applicable to public companies, including disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements and the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.  
 The information that we provide may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies due to these reduced reporting obligations.  
 Results of Operations  
 The following table outlines our results of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Our historical consolidated operating results do not reflect the results of operations of our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions prior to the effective date of those acquisitions. As a result, our historical consolidated operating results may not be indicative of what our results of operations will be for future periods.  
 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
 Net revenue  
 Net revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $73.2 million on accession volume of 540,000, inclusive of approximately $7.2 million of revenue and 39,000 accessions from the practices acquired in 2015 and 2016. Net revenue at the practices we have operated for the full periods in both 2016 and 2015, which we refer to herein as our existing practices, decreased by approximately 1%, or $0.7 million, to approximately $66.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $66.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Existing practice accession volume was 501,000, a decrease of approximately 5% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 529,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The average revenue per accession for our existing practices for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased by about 5%, to $132, compared to $126 for the same period in 2015. The decrease in existing practice revenue was primarily related to lower volume from certain continuing clients as well as client attrition, partially offset by changes in service mix and higher Medicare reimbursement under the 2016 Physician Fee Schedule.

    Cost of services   
 Cost of services for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $38.7 million, including $3.7 million for practices acquired in 2015 and 2016. Cost of services at existing practices decreased approximately $0.6 million, or 2%, to $35.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from $35.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of lower practice supplies costs which correlate to lower volume, lower personnel related costs and reductions in medical liability.  
 As a result of the preceding factors, cost of services was 52.9% of net revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 53.0% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Gross margin was 47.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 47.0% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $0.2 million, or less than 1%, to $16.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, including approximately $0.6 million related to practices acquired in 2015 and 2016, from approximately $16.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was approximately $0.3 million higher at practices acquired in 2015 and 2016 and approximately $0.1 million higher at our existing practices. Compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, selling, general and administrative expenses at corporate decreased by approximately $0.2 million due to lower personnel related costs.  
 As a result of the preceding factors, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 23.0% of net revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 24.0% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  
 Provision for doubtful accounts  
 Our provision for doubtful accounts decreased approximately $0.2 million, or 6%, to $4.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from $4.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. As a percentage of net revenue, the provision for doubtful accounts decreased to 5.4% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 6.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to changes in our collections processes which have improved our collections results.   
 The Company s consolidated provision for doubtful accounts could be positively or negatively impacted by various factors including, among other things, changes in payor mix and the provision for doubtful accounts for practices that we acquire.  
 Intangible asset amortization expense 
 Amortization expense increased to $5.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from $4.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, as a result of amortization of finite lived intangible assets recorded for practices acquired in 2015 and 2016. We generally amortize our intangible assets over lives ranging from 3 to 15 years.  
 Management fees, related parties  
 Management fees to related parties were approximately $0.7 million for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Management fees are based on 1.0% of net revenue plus expenses.  
 Merger and acquisition transaction costs  
 Merger and acquisition transaction costs increased by approximately $0.5 million, to $0.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.3 million the quarter ended September 30, 2015, reflecting a higher level of transaction activity.  
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration    
 For each of the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we recorded expense of $0.2 million for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration issued in connection with our acquisitions. The change in fair value of contingent consideration results from revisions in our projections to reflect recent results, as well as other variables such as the discount rate, the valuation date and actual payments made.

    Interest expense   
 Interest expense was approximately $10.5 million for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  
 Provision (benefit) for income taxes  
 We are a Delaware limited liability company for federal and state income tax purposes, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, we generally have not been subject to income taxes, and the income attributable to us has been allocated to the members of Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC in accordance with the terms of the Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement. However, certain of our subsidiaries are structured as corporations and therefore are subject to federal and state income taxes. The provision for federal and state income taxes for these subsidiaries, as reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements, amounted to approximately $0.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $10,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, as a result of taxable income recognized for certain of our subsidiaries structured as corporations.  
 Comparison of the Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
 Net revenue  
 Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $214.8 million on accession volume of 1,604,000, inclusive of approximately $19.5 million of revenue and 107,000 accessions from the practices acquired in 2015 and 2016. Net revenue at our existing practices, increased by approximately 2%, or $4.5 million, to approximately $195.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $190.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Existing practice accession volume was 1,497,000, a decrease of approximately 2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 1,533,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The average revenue per accession for our existing practices for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by about 5% to $130, compared to $124 for the same period in 2015. The increase in existing practice revenue was primarily related to changes in service mix, higher Medicare reimbursement under the 2016 Physician Fee Schedule, and higher revenue from ARI, partially offset by lower volume from certain continuing clients as well as client attrition.  
 Cost of services  
 Cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $114.4 million, including $10.2 million for practices acquired in 2015 and 2016. Cost of services at existing practices decreased approximately $0.8 million, or less than 1%, to $104.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $104.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of lower labs supplies and personnel related costs.  As a result of the preceding factors, cost of services was 53.3% of net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 54.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross margin was 46.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 45.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $4.2 million, or 9%, to $53.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, including approximately $1.8 million related to practices acquired in 2015 and 2016, from $49.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, selling, general and administrative expenses at corporate increased by approximately $0.5 million due to higher professional fees, including legal and accounting services. Selling, general and administrative expenses at our existing practices for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, increased by $2.2 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for our existing practices increased approximately $1.2 million for non-cash charges related to two leased locations vacated in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as well as higher personnel related and billing and collections costs. Despite the preceding factors, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately 25.0% of net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 25.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Provision for doubtful accounts  
 Our provision for doubtful accounts decreased approximately $0.6 million, or 5%, to $12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As a percentage of net revenue, the provision for doubtful accounts decreased to 5.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 6.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to changes in our collections processes which have improved our collections results.

    Intangible asset amortization expense  
 Amortization expense increased to $14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of amortization of finite lived intangible assets recorded for practices acquired in 2015 and 2016. We generally amortize our intangible assets over lives ranging from 3 to 15 years.  
 Management fees, related parties  
 Management fees to related parties increased to approximately $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the increase in revenue for the same period. Management fees are based on 1.0% of net revenue plus expenses.  
 Impairment of goodwill  
 During nine months ended September 30, 2015, we identified indications of impairment at two of our reporting units. One of the reporting units exhibited lower margins and both of the reporting units experienced lower volume as a result of competition to such an extent as to indicate potential impairment. Regarding these reporting units, we believe the reduction in volume due to attrition in the client base resulted in a reduction in the fair values of the reporting units below their carrying values. As of September 30, 2015, we tested goodwill for impairment at these two reporting units and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $39.6 million to write down the carrying value of goodwill. There were no goodwill impairments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Merger and acquisition transaction costs 
 Merger and acquisition transaction costs increased to approximately $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting a higher level of transaction activity.  
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration    
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded non-cash expense of $1.1 million for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration issued in connection with our acquisitions, compared to $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change in fair value of contingent consideration results from revisions in our projections to reflect recent results, as well as other variables such as the discount rate, the valuation date and actual payments made.  
 Interest expense  
 Interest expense increased by $1.1 million, to approximately $31.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $30.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense primarily resulted from approximately $17.0 million average total debt as a result of additional borrowings under the delayed draw term loans to fund acquisitions.  
 Benefit from income taxes  
 We are a Delaware limited liability company for federal and state income tax purposes, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, we generally have not been subject to income taxes, and the income attributable to us has been allocated to the members of Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC in accordance with the terms of the Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement. However, certain of our subsidiaries are structured as corporations and therefore are subject to federal and state income taxes. The benefit from federal and state income taxes for these subsidiaries, as reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements, amounted to $0.5 million and $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, as a result of the taxable income of our subsidiaries are structured as corporations.  
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 Since inception, we have primarily financed operations through capital contributions from our equityholders, long-term debt financing and cash flow from operations.

    On December 20, 2010, we issued $200.0 million in unsecured senior notes that mature on Ja  nuary 15, 2018, which we refer to as our Senior Notes. The Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 10.75%, which is payable each January 15   th    and July 15   th   . In accordance with the indenture governing our Senior Notes, we are subject to certain limitations on issuing additional debt and are subject to other customary affirmative and negative covenants. The Senior Notes are currently redeemable at our option a  t 102.688% of par, plus accrued interest. The redemption price decreases to 100% of par on January 15, 2017. The Senior Notes rank equally in right of repayment with all of our other senior indebtedness, but are subordinated to our secured indebtedness to   the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness.    
 On July 31, 2014 we entered into a $220.0 million credit facility with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, which facility, as subsequently amended, we refer to as our senior secured credit facility. Our senior secured credit facility initially consisted of a $165.0 million initial term loan, $30.0 million revolving credit line and $25.0 million delayed draw term loan.  The delayed draw term loan facility was available through October 31, 2015 to pay for acquisitions, including acquisition related fees and expenses. Each of the term loan, revolving credit line and delayed draw term loan under the senior secured credit facility has a maturity of five years but is subject to a maturity date of October 14, 2017 if our Senior Notes are not refinanced or their maturity is not extended, or if the credit facility is not amended and extended, prior to such date.   
 Under the outstanding term loans, quarterly principal repayments of $0.5 million became due commencing on September 30, 2015 through December 31, 2016.  Quarterly principal repayments increase to $0.9 million on March 31, 2017 through June 30, 2018 and to $1.3 million on September 30, 2018 and each quarter end thereafter, with the balance due at maturity. Prior to the second amendment on April 10, 2015, at our option, interest under the credit facility was either LIBOR, with a 1.25% floor, plus 7%, or at a base rate, with a 2.25% floor, plus 6%.  
 On April 10, 2015 we entered into a second amendment to our senior secured credit facility. This amendment added a $40.0 million delayed draw term loan B facility that was available through April 10, 2016 to pay for acquisitions, including acquisition related fees and expenses. The second amendment also increased the interest rate under the credit facility to LIBOR, with a 1.25% floor, plus 7.125%, or to the base rate, with a 2.25% floor, plus 6.125%. The senior secured credit facility is subject to a 2.25% per annum fee on the undrawn amount thereof, payable quarterly in arrears.  
 In connection with the acquisitions we consummated on July 15, 2015, we borrowed the remaining $15.3 million available under the delayed draw term loan. The amount we borrowed exceeded the total we paid for eligible acquisitions, inclusive of related expenses, by $5.4 million. Subsequent amendments extended the remaining $5.4 million availability under the $25.0 million delayed draw term loan from July 31, 2015 to October 31, 2015. We used the remaining $5.4 million for an acquisition completed on October 29, 2015. 
 As of September 30, 2016, we owed $162.5 million under the term loan, $25.0 million under the delayed draw term loan and $10.0 million under the delayed draw term loan B facility. As of September 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding and we had $30.0 million available under our revolving credit facility.  
 The senior secured credit facility is secured by essentially all of our assets and unconditionally guaranteed by us and certain of the Company s and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries and is subject to certain financial covenants. The senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio (based upon the ratio of total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA, net of agreed cash amounts) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (based upon the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to net cash interest expense), each quarter based on the last four fiscal quarters. The maximum leverage ratio as of September 30, 2016 was 10.10:1.00 and becomes more restrictive each quarter through maturity. The minimum interest coverage ratio was 1.00:1.00 as of September 30, 2016 and increases to 1.05:1.00 on December 31, 2017. In addition, we are required to maintain liquidity (defined as availability under the revolving credit facility plus amounts in bank accounts that are subject to the agent s perfected first priority liens) of at least $5.0 million at any time and $10.0 million on the last business day of each month. We are also subject to other restrictive covenants set forth in our senior secured credit facility.  Generally, we are permitted to make voluntary prepayments under our senior secured credit facility and to reduce the revolving loan commitments at any time. However, subject to certain exceptions, prepayments and commitment reductions are currently subject to a premium equal to 2.0%, which will be reduced to 1.0% effective August 1, 2017 and eliminated entirely after July 31, 2018. 
 Contingent consideration for acquisitions 
 In connection with the majority of our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay additional consideration annually over future periods of three to six years, based upon contract retention and the attainment of stipulated levels of operating results by each of the acquired entities, as defined in their respective agreements. The computation of the annual operating results is subject to review and approval by sellers prior to payment. In the event there is a dispute, the Company will pay the undisputed amount and then take reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute with the sellers. If the sellers are successful in asserting their dispute, the Company could be required to make additional payments in future periods. We made contingent note payments of $3.4 million and $2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.   
 - 32 - 
 
    As of September 30, 2016, the total maximum future payments of contingent consideration issued in acquisitions was $19.7 million. Lesser amounts will be paid or no   payments will be made for earnings below the maximum level of stipulated earnings or if the stipulated contracts are not retained. We utilize a present value of estimated future payments approach to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration.   These estimates involve significant projections regarding future performance of the acquired practices. If actual future results differ significantly from current estimates, the actual payments for contingent consideration will differ correspondingly. As   of September 30, 2016, the fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions was $12.0 million, representing the present value of approximately $16.1 million in estimated future payments through 2021.   
 In April 2015, we finalized a settlement agreement with the sellers in one of our acquisitions. As a result of the settlement, we recorded a charge of approximately $5.4 million in the change in fair value of contingent consideration in the year ended December 31, 2014. In connection with the settlement, we paid cash of $0.9 million to the sellers within five days of settlement and modified the contingent notes to extend payments for an additional two years.   
 Medical Malpractice Insurance 
 We are insured on a claims-made basis up to our policy limits through a third party malpractice insurance policy. We establish reserves, on an undiscounted basis, for self-insured deductibles, claims incurred and reported and claims incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) during the policy period. We had recorded medical malpractice liabilities of $2.0 million as of September 30, 2016, which were included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We also record a receivable from our insurance carrier for expected recoveries. Expected insurance recoveries, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, were $0.3 million as of September 30, 2016. So long as we maintain third party malpractice insurance policies, the IBNR claims will be covered by such third party policy up to the policy limits. 
 Cash and Working Capital  
 We require significant cash flow to service our debt obligations, including contingent notes. In addition to servicing our debt, we use cash to make acquisitions, purchase property and equipment and otherwise fund our operations. Cash used to fund our operations excludes the impact of non-cash items, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration and non-cash stock-based compensation, and is impacted by the timing of our payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses and collections of accounts receivable.  
 As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $12.1 million and working capital of $11.9 million, and we had $30.0 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are to fund our operations, service debt, including payments due under our contingent notes, make acquisitions and purchase property and equipment. Cash used to fund our operations excludes the impact of non-cash items, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration and non-cash stock-based compensation, and is impacted by the timing of our payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses and collections of accounts receivable. 
 We believe our current cash and cash equivalents together with cash from operations and the amount available under our revolving credit facility will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements through September 30, 2017. In order to access the amounts available under our revolving credit facility, we must meet the financial tests and ratios contained in our senior secured credit facility. We currently expect to meet these financial tests and ratios at least through that date. Nonetheless, we may not meet these financial tests and ratios and therefore our ability to access the amounts otherwise available under our revolving credit facility may be limited. Our ability to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements in the longer term is subject to several factors, including, our ability to refinance our Senior Notes and/or our credit facility prior to October 14, 2017, our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us, our continued access to amounts available under our revolving credit facility, our ability to implement our business strategy and the absence of material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements.

    Net Cash Used In Operating Activities   
 Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.5 million, compared to $6.8 million net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflected a net loss of $16.0 million and certain adjustments for non-cash items, including $17.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $2.4 million of amortization of original issue discount and debt issue costs, $0.5 million of deferred tax benefit, $1.1 million of non-cash charges for the change in fair value of contingent consideration and $1.2 million non-cash charge for the abandonment of leased facilities. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 also reflected increases and decreases in working capital, excluding acquisitions, including a $5.2 million increase in accounts receivable, a $1.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $1.7 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $1.2 million increase in accrued compensation and a $5.4 million decrease in accrued interest. As of September 30, 2016 our DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) was 48 days, compared to 43 days of September 30, 2015, and 43 days as of December 31, 2015.   Various factors contributed to the  increase in DSOs , including Medicare denials currently under appeal,  delays in billing due to conversion of billing systems at four of our locations,  longer collection cycles on accounts receivable for acquired hospital-based practices and delays in collections by one payor for a credentialing issue resolved in October 2016 . 
 Net Cash Used In Investing Activities  
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $12.7 million compared to $12.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of $7.3 million net cash paid for business  acquisitions, $3.4 million for contingent note payments and $2.0 million for purchases of property and equipment.  
 Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities  
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $8.2 million compared to $13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we borrowed $10.0 million under the delayed draw term loan, repaid $1.5 million under the initial term loan and paid $0.3 million of financing transaction costs.  
 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA)  
 We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted for impairment of goodwill, management fees, equity-based compensation, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, abandoned facility costs, merger and acquisition transaction costs, cost savings for reductions in force, implementation of a laboratory systems upgrade, pro forma acquired EBITDA, and certain other charges. We believe that disclosing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors, enhancing their understanding of our financial performance and providing them an important financial metric used to evaluate performance in the health care industry.  
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow from operating activities as those terms are defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, they may not be comparable to the measures for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year.  
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for measures of our financial performance as determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net income and operating income. Because other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have other limitations as analytical tools when compared to the use of net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, including:  

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the provision of income tax expense of our subsidiaries;      

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense we incur;      

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any attribution of costs to our operations related to our investments and capital expenditures through depreciation and amortization charges; and     

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cost of compensation we provide to our employees in the form of stock option awards.     

 - 34 - 
 
    The following is a reconcili  ation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):   

(A)   
 
 Represents fees for management services provided by Summit Partners and KRG Capital Partners pursuant to a management services agreement.  Since April 2013, we have accrued but not paid management fees to comply with the terms of the senior secured credit facility.     

(B)   
 
 Represents non-cash changes in the fair value of contingent consideration payable by us in connection with our acquisitions.  The changes related to numerous variables, including discount rate, remaining pay out period and the projected performance for each acquisition.     

(C)   
 
 Represents $1.0 million of non-cash charges to accrue the present value of contractual rent and $43,000 of non-cash charges to write off equipment in connection with the Company s decision to vacate a facility in Las Vegas, Nevada in January 2016 and $86,000 of non-cash charges to write off equipment in connection with the Company s decision to vacate a facility in Tampa, Florida in March 2016.    

(E)   
 
 Represents payments made in three and nine months ended September 2015 and 2016 to employees whose positions were permanently eliminated in those periods to improve profitability and margin in response to rate pressure specific to those periods, in each case assuming the employees had been terminated at the beginning of the relevant period.     

(F)   
 
 Represents one-time expenses relating to a company-wide initiative to standardize our laboratory procedures and implement a common LIS system in our existing laboratories. As of September 30, 2016, we had standardized approximately 40% of the laboratories included in this initiative We are in the process of standardizing the remaining laboratories and we do not expect these expenses to recur once all our existing laboratories have been standardized.    

(G)   
 
 Amounts represent the incremental Adjusted EBITDA that we estimate would have been contributed by acquired practices for the period, assuming the acquisitions occurred on the first day of the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, represents the incremental Adjusted EBITDA of $0.1 million that we estimate would have been contributed by the two pathology practices we acquired in Texas on July 15, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, represents the incremental Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $0.5 million that we estimate would have been contributed by the pathology practice we acquired in Oregon on March 31, 2016 and the incremental Adjusted EBITDA of $51,000 that we estimate would have been contributed by the pathology practice we acquired in Florida on April 8, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, represents the incremental Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.1 million that we estimate would have been contributed by the two pathology practices we acquired in Texas on July 15, 2015. In each case, our estimates of incremental Adjusted EBITDA are based on due diligence quality of earnings reports prepared for us in connection with the applicable acquisitions.    

 - 35 - 

(I)   
 
 The Adjusted EBITDA presented in this table does not reflect adjustments of other amounts that may be added back pursuant to  our credit facility and the indenture governing our Senior Notes of $0.2 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.9 million for each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  
 Contractual Obligations  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no material changes in our commitments or contractual liabilities outside of the ordinary course of business. 
 Health Care Regulatory and Reimbursement Changes 
 In the 2014 Final Physician Fee Schedule Rule, CMS calculated the 2014 conversion factor using the SGR method. The new conversion factor for 2014 represented a 20.1% reduction from the 2013 conversion factor. On December 18, 2013, Congress passed legislation that enacted a 0.5% increase in the conversion factor, which was effective through March 31, 2014. On April 1, 2014, President Obama signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 ( PAMA ). PAMA extended the 0.5% increase through March 31, 2015 and made other changes to laboratory reimbursement discussed below. 
 On April 16, 2015, President Obama signed the Medicare and CHIP Reauthorization Act ( MACRA ). MACRA repealed the provisions related to the Medicare SGR formula and implemented a new physician payment system that is designed to reward the quality of care. In addition, it extended the then-current Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rates through June 2015, and then increased them by 0.5% for the remainder of 2015. Furthermore, the rates are to be increased annually by 0.5%, beginning January 1, 2016 through 2019. For 2020 through 2025, the rates will be frozen, although payments will be adjusted beginning in 2019 to account for performance on certain quality metrics under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment Systems ( MIPS ) or to reflect physician participation in alternative payment models ( APMs ). For 2026 and subsequent years, qualified APM participants receive an annual 0.75% increase on Medicare physician payment rates, while those not participating receive a 0.25% annual payment increase, plus any applicable MIPS-based payment adjustments. In April 2016 CMS issued a proposed rule that would implement the requirements of MACRA. At this time, it is too early to determine how these changes may impact our business. 
 In the 2014 Physician Fee Schedule Rule, CMS also changed CPT codes for certain stains we commonly use and reduced the RVUs related to those codes. These changes, as well as other limits on other commonly-used CPT codes, resulted in decreased Medicare reimbursement for some of our services. We estimated the changes to the 2014 Physician Fee Schedule resulted in a reduction of our annualized Medicare revenue of approximately $3 million. We have experienced isolated reductions in reimbursement from non-governmental third-party payors tied to the Medicare reductions. However, at this time we are unable to predict the extent to which non-governmental third-party payors will seek to reduce our reimbursement rates as a result of reductions in Medicare s Physician Fee Schedule. 
 - 36 - 
 
    In the 2015 Physician Fee Rule, CMS enacted additional payment changes. Although it had indicated previously that it considered flow cytometry, a test that we commonly bill, to be potentially misvalued and overpaid, CMS did not c  hange the payment for that code in the Final Rule. CMS did, however, change how it pays for prostate biopsy codes, which is also a test that we bill relatively often, and stated that it did consider that code to be potentially misvalued. In addition, it ma  de substantial reductions in certain other codes, including the codes applicable to FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), which we also bill; however, those cuts were offset by increases in other codes, including CPT 88305, which is the most common cod  e that we bill. Additional changes to these, and other codes that we bill, could also be implemented in the future. CMS also stated that it does not intend to implement the policy that it proposed in the 2014 Proposed Fee Schedule Rule that would have limi  ted certain physician payments to the amounts paid in the hospital setting. Finally, CMS announced that it is withdrawing its authority to amend laboratory rates to reflect technological changes as mandated by PAMA.  
 On October 30, 2015, CMS issued its Final Physician Fee Schedule Rule for 2016, which adopted new policies that went into effect in January 2016. Our review of the Final Rule suggests that the impact of the changes could be an increase of approximately $2.0 million in our annualized Medicare revenue, inclusive of acquisitions completed in 2014 and 2015. However, our product mix, payor mix and volume may change and the actual impact of the changes to the 2016 Physician Fee Rule may vary significantly from our estimates. This does not reflect any potential change that Congress might make in the future with regard to the conversion factor. 
 On November 2, 2016, the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services (CMS) issued its 2017 Physician Fee Schedule, which we refer to as the 2017 Fee Schedule.  In the 2017 Fee Schedule, CMS effectuated reductions to CPT Code 88305, which is the CPT Code we bill most frequently, of approximately 7%. Reimbursement rates for flow cytometry codes were also reduced by approximately 19%. Based on our current Medicare business mix, we estimate the changes to the 2017 Fee Schedule would result in a reduction of our annualized Medicare revenue of approximately $3.3 million.  
 The Budget Control Act of 2011 created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which was tasked with recommending proposals to reduce spending. Under the law, the Joint Committee s failure to achieve a targeted deficit reduction, or Congress  failure to pass the Committee s recommendations without amendment by December 23, 2011, would result in automatic across-the-board cuts to most discretionary programs. Automatic cuts also would be made to Medicare and would result in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and continuing through 2021. Because the Joint Committee was not able to agree on a set of deficit reduction recommendations on which Congress could vote, cuts went into effect in April 2013. This reduction was extended by PAMA through 2024. We have estimated that sequestration has resulted in a decline of approximately $1.1 million in our annual Medicare revenue 
   
 Recent Acquisitions 
 The following   summarizes   the   acquisitions   we have completed   since   January   1, 2015. 
  2015 Acquisitions  
 On July 15, 2015, we acquired the assets of two pathology practices and a billing service, all located in Texas. On October 29, 2015, we acquired 100% of the equity of a pathology practice in Ohio. We paid a combined total of $15.4 million of cash in the aggregate at closing for the two acquisitions and issued contingent notes payable over from three to six years. Payments under the contingent notes will be paid annually, up to a maximum of $11.9 million over the term of the notes, subject to the retention of certain key facility contracts, future financial results and the cash received under specified client contracts. We used the available cash under our $25.0 million delayed draw term loan to pay the $15.4 million cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisitions.  
  2016 Acquisitions   
 On March 31, 2016, we acquired 100% of the equity of a hospital-based pathology practice located in Oregon. On April 8, 2016, we acquired 100% of the equity of a second hospital-based pathology practice in Florida. In connection with these 2016 acquisitions, we paid total net cash of $7.2 million and issued contingent notes payable over three years. Payments under the contingent notes will be paid annually, up to a maximum of $1.5 million over the term of the note, subject to the future financial performance of the acquired practice and the retention of a key facility contract. We used the available cash under its $40.0 million delayed draw term loan B to pay the $7.2 million cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition.

   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.     

 Our exposure to market risks results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. There have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

   Controls and Procedures.     

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective as of September 30, 2016.  
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls  
 Our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that we will detect all control issues and instances of fraud, if any exist.

       Legal Proceedings.     

 We are from time to time involved in litigation that we consider to be ordinary and incidental to our business. We may be named in various claims, disputes, legal actions and other proceedings involving malpractice, employment and other matters. A negative outcome in certain of the ongoing litigation could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Further, prolonged litigation, regardless of which party prevails, could be costly, divert management s attention or result in increased costs of doing business. While the outcome of pending legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

     Risk Factors.     

 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 are not the only risks that we face. In addition, risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. There have been no material changes in or additions to the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
