1.  ORGANIZATION 
    
  The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  In the opinion of management, all adjustments and eliminations, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America   (   GAAP   )   the financial position of Hines Global REIT II, Inc. as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been included.  The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted according to such rules and regulations.  For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in Hines Global REIT II, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Hines Global REIT II, Inc. (the  Company ), was formed as a Maryland corporation on   July 31, 2013   for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in and owning commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments.  The Company intends to conduct substantially all of its operations through Hines Global REIT II Properties, LP (the  Operating Partnership ).  Beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2015, the Company has operated and intends to continue to operate in a manner to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes.  The business of the Company is managed by Hines Global REIT II Advisors LP (the  Advisor ), an affiliate of Hines Interests Limited Partnership ( Hines ), pursuant to the Advisory Agreement between the Company, the Advisor and the Operating Partnership (defined below). 
    
  On   August 20, 2014  , the Company commenced an offering of up to   $2.5 billion   of its common stock (the  Offering ) in any combination of Class A shares ( Class A Shares ) and Class T shares ( Class T Shares ) of the Company s common stock.  The Company engaged Hines Securities, Inc. (the  Dealer Manager ), an affiliate of the Advisor, to serve as the dealer manager for the Offering and market its shares.  As of   November 1, 2016  , the Company had received gross offering proceeds of   $230.7 million   from the sale of   23.6 million   shares. 
    
  The Company intends to invest the net proceeds from the Offering in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments throughout the United States and internationally.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned direct investments in   five   properties totaling   2.0 million   square feet that were   97%   leased.  See the table in  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Executive Summary  for additional information regarding each of the properties in which the Company owned an interest as of   September 30, 2016  . 

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the accounts of Hines Global REIT II, Inc. and the Operating Partnership (over which the Company exercises financial and operating control).  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02, the Company has determined that the Operating Partnership is considered a variable interest entity ( VIE ).  However, the Company meets the disclosure exemption criteria, as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and the Company s partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  Additionally, the Company has retroactively changed, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , its classification of distributions in its consolidated balance sheet and statement of equity by reflecting such distributions as charges against  accumulated distributions in excess of earnings  to be consistent with the 2016 presentation.  This presentation change had no impact on the balances in total equity in any of the periods presented. 
    
  Tenant and Other Receivables 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , in addition to the straight-line rent receivable discussed below, tenant and other receivables also consisted of a receivable from the Company s transfer agent related to offering proceeds not yet received of   $250,173   and   $2.9 million  , respectively  .

     Table of Contents  

Deferred Financing Costs 
    
  Deferred financing costs consist of direct costs incurred in obtaining debt financing.  These costs are presented as a direct reduction from the related debt liability for permanent mortgages and presented as an asset for revolving credit arrangements.  In total, deferred financing costs had a carrying value of   $1.1 million   and   $525,250   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  These costs are amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the terms of the obligations.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company had   $48,910   and   $25,709  , respectively, of deferred financing costs amortized into interest expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company had   $124,641   and   $62,625  , respectively, of deferred financing costs amortized into interest expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
    
  Other Assets 
    
  Other assets included the following: 

(1) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , this amount consisted of a   $5.0 million   earnest money deposit in connection with the potential acquisition of   Rookwood Commons   and   Rookwood Pavilion   (collectively referred to as    Rookwood   ).  See    Note 3      Investment Property for additional information regarding the potential acquisition of   Rookwood  . 
              (2) 
    As of   December 31, 2015  , this amount consisted of a deposit that had been paid related to the acquisition of the Domain Apartments, which was completed in January 2016. 
       
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  The Company recognizes rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease including rent holidays, if any.  Straight-line rent receivables were   $1.9 million   and   $627,875   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Straight-line rent receivables consist of the difference between the tenants  rents calculated on a straight-line basis from the date of acquisition or lease commencement over the remaining terms of the related leases and the tenants  actual rents due under the lease agreements and is included in tenant and other receivables in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Revenues associated with operating expense recoveries are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred based upon the tenant lease provisions.  Revenues relating to lease termination fees are recognized on a straight-line basis amortized from the time that a tenant s right to occupy the leased space is modified through the end of the revised lease term. 
    
  Issuer Costs 
    
  Subject to the limitations described below, the Company reimburses the Advisor and its affiliates for any issuer costs related to the Offering that it pays on the Company s behalf.  Such costs consist of, among other costs, expenses of the Company s organization, actual legal, accounting, bona fide out-of-pocket itemized and detailed due diligence costs, printing, filing fees, transfer agent costs, postage, escrow fees, data processing fees, advertising and sales literature and other offering-related costs.  Organizational issuer costs, such as expenses associated with the formation of the Company and its board of directors, are expensed as incurred, and offering-related issuer costs are recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital.  From inception to   September 30, 2016  , issuer costs incurred by the Advisor on the Company s behalf totaled   $10.4 million  , of which   $45,914   related to organizational issuer costs. 
    
  The Advisory Agreement was amended, effective February 29, 2016, to reflect that the Company will not reimburse the Advisor for the cumulative issuer costs incurred in connection with the Company s organization and public offerings, in excess of   2.5%   of gross offering proceeds from the Company s public offerings.  On   April 14, 2016  , the Advisor reimbursed the Company for   $4.0 million   in issuer costs that the Company had previously reimbursed to the Advisor in excess of this new   2.5%   cap.  Despite the new   2.5%   cap, the Company expects cumulative issuer costs to be less than   2.5%   of gross offering  
  
   6 

     Table of Contents  

proceeds at the conclusion of its public offerings.  As the Company raises additional offering proceeds, the Company expects to reimburse the Advisor for the   $4.0 million   that the Advisor repaid to the Company in April 2016.  As a result, the Company has recorded a liability equal to all unreimbursed issuer costs that have been incurred to date to reflect its expectation that all of these amounts will be reimbursed to the Advisor. 
    
  Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fee 
    
  Per the terms of the Company s Third Amended and Restated Dealer Manager Agreement, the Company will pay a distribution and stockholder servicing fee of   1.0%   per annum of the gross offering price per share (or, if the Company is no longer offering primary shares, the then-current estimated net asset value per share, if any has been disclosed) for Class T Shares sold in the Offering.  The Company will cease paying the distribution and stockholder servicing fee with respect to any particular Class T Share and that Class T Share will convert into a number of Class A Shares on the earlier of: (i) a listing of the Class A Shares on a national securities exchange; (ii) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s assets; (iii) the end of the month in which the Dealer Manager determines that total underwriting compensation paid in the Offering including the distribution and stockholder servicing fee paid on all Class T Shares sold in the Offering is equal to   10.0%   of the gross proceeds of the Offering from the sale of both Class A Shares and Class T Shares; (iv) the end of the month in which the transfer agent, on behalf of the Company, determines that underwriting compensation paid in the primary offering including the distribution and stockholder servicing fee paid with respect to the Class T Shares held by a stockholder within his or her particular account equals   10.0%   of the gross offering price at the time of investment of the Class T Shares held in such account; and (v) on any Class T Share that is redeemed or repurchased.  Although the Company cannot predict the length of time over which this fee will be paid due to potential changes in the offering price or estimated net asset value of the Company s Class T Shares, this fee would be paid over approximately   5.25 years   from the date of purchase, assuming a constant per share offering price or estimated net asset value, as applicable. 
    
  The Company records distribution and stockholder servicing fees as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and the related liability in an amount equal to the maximum fees payable in relation to the Class T Shares on the date the shares are issued.  The liability will be relieved over time, as the fees are paid to the Dealer Manager, or it will be adjusted if the fees are no longer payable pursuant to the conditions described above.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has recorded a   $3.2 million   liability related to these fees, which is included in due to affiliates on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  See    Note 7      Related Party Transactions for additional information regarding this fee. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance that eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.  Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment.  This new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in the Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) are effective for public entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements.

This leased asset with a value of approximately   $218,318   has been recorded in buildings and improvements in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  .  The following schedule provides the future minimum lease payments together with the present value of the net minimum lease payments under the Company s capital lease obligation for the period from   October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016   and for the year ending December 31,   2017  :

4.  RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF REAL ESTATE

(1) 
    For Bishop s Square, which was denominated in Euros, amounts have been translated at an exchange rate based on the rate in effect on the acquisition date. 
       
           (2) 
    The land at Bishop s Square is subject to a   999  -year ground lease with the local municipality in Ireland.  Since the Company does not have title to the land, approximately   $33.4 million   has been recorded to in-place lease intangibles and will be amortized over the remaining term of the ground lease. 
       
  The purchase price allocations for the Company s 2016 acquisitions are preliminary and subject to change until the Company finalizes the allocations, which will be no later than twelve months from the acquisition dates.

6.  DISTRIBUTIONS 
    
  With the authorization of its board of directors, the Company declared distributions with respect to Class A Shares of the Company s common stock for the period from   October 1, 2014   through   November 30, 2016  .  For the period from   October 1, 2014   through   April 30, 2016  , distributions for Class A Shares were calculated based on stockholders of record each day in an amount equal to   $0.001575342   per share, per day.  The distribution rate per share, per day was increased effective   May 1, 2016  .  As a result, with respect to the period from   May 1, 2016   through   November 30, 2016  , distributions for Class A Shares were or will be calculated based on stockholders of record each day in an amount equal to   $0.001594766   per share, per day.  Also, with the authorization of the board of directors, the Company declared distributions with respect to Class T Shares of the Company s common stock for the period from   August 24, 2015   through   November 30, 2016  .  For the period from   August 24, 2015   through   April 30, 2016  , distributions for Class T Shares were calculated based on stockholders of record each day in an amount equal to   $0.001575342   per share, per day less the distribution and stockholder servicing fees that were payable with respect to such Class T Shares (as calculated on a daily basis).  The distribution rate per share, per day was increased effective   May 1, 2016  .  As a result, with respect to the period from   May 1, 2016   through   November 30, 2016  , distributions for Class T Shares were or will be calculated based on stockholders of record each day in an amount equal to   $0.001594766   per share, per day less the distribution and stockholder servicing fees that are payable with respect to such Class T Shares (as calculated on a daily basis).

Distributions reinvested pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan were or will be reinvested in shares of the same class as the shares on which the distributions are being made.  Some or all of the cash distributions may be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations. 
    
  The following table outlines the Company s total distributions declared to stockholders and noncontrolling interests (HALP II) for each of the quarters ended during   2016   and   2015  , including the breakout between the distributions declared in cash and those reinvested pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan.

  The table below outlines fees and expense reimbursements incurred that are payable by the Company to Hines and its affiliates for the periods indicated below: 

(1) 
    On July 25, 2016, the Company, the Dealer Manager and the Advisor entered into the Third Amended and Restated Dealer Manager Agreement, effective as of August 2, 2016 (the  Amended Dealer Manager Agreement ).  Pursuant to the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, the Advisor will pay a portion of the dealer manager fees payable to the dealer manager in an amount equal to   1.5%   of the gross offering proceeds with respect to Class A Shares and Class T Shares sold in the primary Offering on and after August 2, 2016.  The Advisor will not be reimbursed by the Company in any way for the payment of such dealer manager fees.

    See    Note 2      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Issuer Costs for additional information on the amendment to the Company s Advisory Agreement regarding the reimbursement of issuer costs to the Advisor. 
               (4) 
    Includes amounts the Advisor paid on behalf of the Company such as general and administrative expenses and acquisition-related expenses.  These amounts are generally reimbursed to the Advisor during the month following the period in which they are incurred. 
              (5) 
    Includes amounts paid related to the Hines Credit Facility. 

8.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the Company has the ability to access.  Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.  In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety has been determined is based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimated that the fair value of its notes payable, excluding deferred financing costs, which had a book value of   $202.9 million  , was   $202.9 million  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company estimated that the book value of its note payable, excluding deferred financing costs, approximates its fair value since its variable interest rate approximated the then-current lending rate for loans with similar maturities and credit quality.  Management has utilized available market information such as interest rate and spread assumptions of notes payable with similar terms and remaining maturities, to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed.  Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its notes payable fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit quality adjustments associated with its fair value of notes payable utilize Level 3 inputs.  However, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit quality adjustments on the overall valuations of the fair market value of its notes payable and has determined they are not significant.  Other financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other liabilities, due to affiliates and distributions payable.  The carrying value of these items reasonably approximates their fair value based on their highly-liquid nature and/or short-term maturities.  Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, Level 1 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of the cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and Level 2 inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of the remaining financial instruments. 

9.  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
    
  As described previously, the Company intends to invest the net proceeds from the Offering in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments throughout the United States and internationally.  The Company s current business consists of owning, operating, acquiring, developing, investing in, and disposing of real estate assets.  All of the Company s consolidated revenues and property operating expenses as of   September 30, 2016   are from the Company s   five   consolidated real estate properties owned as of that date.  As a result, the Company s operating segments have been classified into one of   four   reportable segments: domestic office investments, domestic multi-family investments, domestic other investments, and international office investments. 
    
  The tables below provide additional information related to each of the Company s segments and a reconciliation to the Company s net income (loss), as applicable.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ), as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as amended.  Such statements include statements concerning future financial performance and distributions, future debt and financing levels, acquisitions and investment objectives, payments to Hines Global REIT II Advisors LP (the  Advisor ), and its affiliates and other plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto as well as all other statements that are not historical statements.  These statements are only predictions.  We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees.  Actual events or our investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as  may,   should,   expect,   could,   intend,   plan,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,   predict,   potential  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. 
    
  The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.  Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, the availability of future financing and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.  Any of the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements could prove to be inaccurate.  To the extent that our assumptions differ from actual results, our ability to meet such forward-looking statements, including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, pay distributions to our shareholders and maintain the value of any real estate investments and real estate-related investments in which we may hold an interest in the future, may be significantly hindered. 
    
  The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in certain forward-looking statements: 
                   
    Our current offering is a best efforts offering and as such, the risk that we will not be able to accomplish our business objectives and that the poor performance of a single investment will materially adversely affect our overall investment performance, will increase if only a small number of shares are purchased in the offering; 

Whether we will have the opportunity to invest offering and distribution reinvestment plan proceeds to acquire properties or other investments or whether such proceeds will be needed to redeem shares or for other purposes, and if proceeds are available for investment, our ability to make such investments in a timely manner and at appropriate amounts that provide acceptable returns; 

Competition for tenants and real estate investment opportunities, including competition with Hines Global REIT, Inc. and other programs sponsored by or affiliated with Hines Interests Limited Partnership ( Hines  

Our reliance on our Advisor, Hines and affiliates of Hines for our day-to-day operations and the selection of real estate investments, and our Advisor s ability to attract and retain high-quality personnel who can provide service at a level acceptable to us; 

Risks associated with conflicts of interests that result from our relationship with our Advisor and Hines, as well as conflicts of interests certain of our officers and directors face relating to the positions they hold with other entities; 

The potential need to fund tenant improvements, lease-up costs or other capital expenditures, as well as increases in property operating expenses and costs of compliance with environmental matters or discovery of previously undetected environmentally hazardous or other undetected adverse conditions at our properties; 

The availability and timing of distributions we may pay is uncertain and cannot be assured; 

19 

     Table of Contents  

Our distributions have been paid using cash flows from financing activities, including proceeds from our public offering, as well as cash from the waiver of fees by our Advisor, and some or all of the distributions we pay in the future may be paid from similar sources or sources such as cash advances by our Advisor, cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees, borrowings and/or proceeds from the offering.  When we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for the acquisition of properties, and your overall return may be reduced; 

Risks associated with debt and our ability to secure financing; 

Risks associated with adverse changes in general economic or local market conditions, including terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, which may affect the markets in which we and our tenants operate; 

Catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and terrorist attacks; and our ability to secure adequate insurance at reasonable and appropriate rates; 

The failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could reduce the amount of cash we have available to pay distributions and make additional investments; 

Changes in governmental, tax, real estate and zoning laws and regulations and the related costs of compliance and increases in our administrative operating expenses, including expenses associated with operating as a public company; 

International investment risks, including the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and the uncertainty of such laws, the tax treatment of transaction structures, political and economic instability, foreign currency fluctuations, and inflation and governmental measures to curb inflation may adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions; 

The lack of liquidity associated with our assets; and 

Our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes. 

These risks are more fully discussed in, and all forward-looking statements should be read in light of, all of the risk factors discussed in  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Executive Summary 
    
  Hines Global REIT II, Inc. ( Hines Global II  and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries,  we,   us  or the  Company ) was formed in   July 2013   to invest in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments located throughout the United States and internationally.  In August 2014, we commenced an offering of up to   $2.5 billion   of our common stock (the  Offering ) in any combination of Class A shares ( Class A Shares ) and Class T shares ( Class T Shares ) of our common stock.  We engaged Hines Securities, Inc. (the  Dealer Manager ), an affiliate of our Advisor, to serve as the dealer manager for the Offering and market our shares.  As of   November 1, 2016  , we have received gross offering proceeds of   $230.7 million   from the sale of   23.6 million   shares. 
    
  On April 13, 2016, our board of directors unanimously approved an estimated net asset value, or NAV, per share of our common stock of $9.03, based on the number of shares issued and outstanding as of February 29, 2016.  The estimated NAV per share reflects a 6.1% increase in the aggregate appraised value of our real estate investments when compared to the purchase price of our real estate investments excluding closing costs, transaction fees and additional capital investments since acquisition.  This 6.1% net increase resulted from a 7.9% appreciation in the aggregate appraised values of our real estate investments since their purchase, which was offset by 1.8% dilution resulting from the devaluation of the Euro against the U.S dollar.  See our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 15, 2016 for more information on the methodologies used to determine, and the limitations of, our estimated NAV per share.

     Table of Contents  

On July 25, 2016, we, our Dealer Manager and our Advisor entered into the Third Amended and Restated Dealer Manager Agreement, effective as of August 2, 2016 (the  Amended Dealer Manager Agreement ).  Pursuant to the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, our Advisor will pay a portion of the dealer manager fees payable to our dealer manager in an amount equal to   1.5%   of the gross offering proceeds with respect to Class A Shares and Class T Shares sold in the primary Offering on and after August 2, 2016.  Our Advisor will not be reimbursed by us in any way for the payment of such dealer manager fees. 
    
  In conjunction with the entry into the Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, our board of directors determined new primary offering prices of   $9.96   per Class A Share and   $9.411   per Class T Share, effective as of August 2, 2016.  These new primary offering prices reflect a reduction equal to the per share amount of dealer manager fees our Advisor has agreed to pay with respect to the Class A Shares and Class T Shares sold in the primary Offering on and after August 2, 2016. 
    
  Our cash flow from operations has been and may continue to be insufficient to fund distributions to stockholders.  We may choose to use advances, deferrals or waivers of fees, if available, from our Advisor or affiliates, borrowings and/or proceeds of the Offering or other sources to fund distributions to our stockholders.  Commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2014, our Advisor agreed to waive the asset management fees for each quarter through   December 31, 2016  , to the extent that our modified funds from operations ( MFFO ), for a particular quarter is less than our distributions declared for such quarter, as disclosed in each Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K, as applicable.  As a result of these waivers, our Advisor waived   $268,678   and   $1.0 million   in asset management fees payable to it for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Further, our Advisor waived   $138,500   and   $129,524   of the asset management fees payable to it for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and   March 31, 2015  , respectively.  However, since MFFO exceeded distributions declared during the three months ended June 30, 2015,   no   asset management fees were waived by our Advisor for that period.  There can be no assurances that our Advisor will continue this waiver, and if not, cash available to pay distributions in future periods may be reduced. 
    
  We intend to meet our primary investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of real estate properties and other real estate investments that relate to properties that are generally diversified by geographic area, lease expirations and tenant industries.  The following table provides additional information regarding each of the properties in which we owned an interest as of   September 30, 2016  .

    We effectively owned a   99.9%   interest in the properties we had acquired as of   September 30, 2016   through our ownership interest in the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.  Hines Global REIT II Associates Limited Partnership ( HALP II ), an affiliate of Hines, owned the remaining   0.1%   interest in the Operating Partnership as of that date. 
       
           (2) 
    The net purchase price for Bishop s Square was denominated in Euros and has been translated at an exchange rate based on the rate in effect on the acquisition date. 
       
           (3) 
    The estimated going-in capitalization rate is determined as of the date of acquisition by dividing the projected property revenues in excess of expenses for the first fiscal year by the net purchase price (excluding closing costs and taxes).  Property revenues in excess of expenses includes all projected operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, parking and any other property-related income) less all projected operating expenses (property operating and maintenance expenses, property taxes, insurance and property management fees).  The projected property revenues in excess of expenses includes assumptions which may not be indicative of the actual future performance of the property, including the assumption that the tenants will perform under their lease agreements during the 12 months following our acquisition of the properties and assumptions concerning estimates of timing and rental rates related to re-leasing vacant space.

In September 2016, we entered into a contract to acquire   Rookwood Commons   and   Rookwood Pavilion  , two contiguous shopping centers located in Cincinnati, Ohio (collectively referred to as    Rookwood   ).  The contract purchase price for   Rookwood   is   $190.0 million  , exclusive of transaction costs and working capital reserves.    Rookwood   consists of   600,071   square feet that is, in the aggregate,   97%   leased.  We expect the closing of this acquisition to occur during the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to a number of closing conditions.  There can be no assurances as to when or if this acquisition will occur. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Each of our critical accounting policies involves the use of estimates that require management to make assumptions that are subjective in nature.  Management relies on its experience, collects historical and current market data, and analyzes these assumptions in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates.  In addition, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments regarding assumptions as to future uncertainties.  Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.  For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see    Note 2      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  Also, a disclosure of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Unless described below, there have been no significant changes to our policies during   2016  . 
    
  Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fee 
    
  Per the terms of our Amended Dealer Manager Agreement, we will pay a distribution and stockholder servicing fee of   1.0%   per annum of the gross offering price per share (or, if we are no longer offering primary shares, the then-current estimated net asset value per share, if any has been disclosed) for Class T Shares sold in the Offering. The distribution and stockholder servicing fees are ongoing fees that are not paid at the time of purchase.  We will cease paying the distribution and stockholder servicing fee with respect to any particular Class T Share and that Class T Share will convert into a number of Class A Shares on the earlier of: (i) a listing of the Class A Shares on a national securities exchange; (ii) a merger or consolidation of us with or into another entity, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets; (iii) the end of the month in which the Dealer Manager determines that total underwriting compensation paid in the Offering including the distribution and stockholder servicing fee paid on all Class T Shares sold in the Offering is equal to   10.0%   of the gross proceeds of the Offering from the sale of both Class A Shares and Class T Shares; (iv) the end of the month in which the transfer agent, on behalf of the us, determines that underwriting compensation paid in the primary offering including the distribution and stockholder servicing fee paid with respect to the Class T Shares held by a stockholder within his or her particular account equals   10.0%   of the gross offering price at the time of investment of the Class T Shares held in such account; and (v) on any Class T Share that is redeemed or repurchased.  Although we cannot predict the length of time over which this fee will be paid due to potential changes in the offering price or estimated net asset value of our Class T Shares, this fee would be paid over approximately   5.25 years   from the date of purchase, assuming a constant per share offering price or estimated net asset value, as applicable. 
    
  We record distribution and stockholder servicing fees as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and the related liability in an amount equal to the maximum fees payable in relation to the Class T Shares on the date the shares are issued.  The liability will be relieved over time, as the fees are paid to the Dealer Manager, or it will be adjusted if the fees are no longer payable pursuant to the conditions described above. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our principal demands for funds are to make real estate investments, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions, and for the payment of principal and interest on any indebtedness we incur.  Generally, we expect to meet operating cash needs from our cash flows from operating activities, and we expect to fund our investments using proceeds of the Offering and debt proceeds. 
    
  We expect that once we have fully invested the proceeds of the Offering and other potential subsequent offerings, our debt financing, including our pro rata share of the debt financing of entities in which we invest, will be in the range of approximately   40%   to   60%   of the aggregate value of our real estate investments and other assets.  Financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at such later time as determined to be appropriate.  In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, lease inducements, tenant improvements and other working capital needs.  Additionally, the amount of debt placed on an individual property or related to a particular investment, including our pro rata share of the amount of debt incurred by an individual entity in which we invest, may be less than   40%   or more than   60%   of the value of such property/investment or the value of the assets owned by such entity, depending on market conditions and other factors.  Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, must be reasonable in relation to our net assets and must be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. 
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

Our charter limits our borrowing to   300%   of our net assets (which approximates   75%   of the cost of our assets) unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with justification for the excess.  Our independent directors approved borrowings in excess of these limitations in connection with our first two investments, since we are in the early stages of raising capital through the Offering.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio was approximately   51%   leveraged,   based on the most recent appraised values of our real estate investments or net purchase prices for properties acquired subsequent to February 2016  . 
    
  Notwithstanding the above, depending on market conditions and other factors, we may choose not to place debt on our portfolio or our assets and may choose not to borrow to finance our operations or to acquire properties.  Any indebtedness we do incur will likely be subject to continuing covenants, and we will likely be required to make continuing representations and warranties about our company in connection with such debt.  Moreover, some or all of our debt may be secured by some or all of our assets.  If we default in the payment of interest or principal on any such debt, breach any representation or warranty in connection with any borrowing or violate any covenant in any loan document, our lender may accelerate the maturity of such debt requiring us to immediately repay all outstanding principal.  If we are unable to make such payment, our lender could foreclose on our assets that are pledged as collateral to such lender.  The lender could also sue us or force us into bankruptcy.  Any such event would have a material adverse effect on the value of an investment in our common shares. 
    
  The discussions below provide additional details regarding our cash flows. 
    
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Our properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, which are used to pay direct leasing costs, property-level operating expenses and interest payments.  Property-level operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages of property management personnel, utilities, cleaning, insurance, security and building maintenance costs, property management and leasing fees, and property taxes.  Additionally, we incur general and administrative expenses, acquisition fees and expenses and asset management fees. 
    
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities was   $3.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to net cash   used in   operating activities of   $2.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Net cash provided by operating activities increased as a result of the acquisition of the Domain Apartments, Cottonwood Corporate Center and Goodyear Crossing II during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the operation of Bishop s Square (acquired March 2015) for the entire   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as well as a reduction of acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses paid during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  We paid acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses totaling   $2.5 million   and   $5.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Under     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (   GAAP   ), acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses are expensed and therefore reduce cash flows from operating activities.  However, we fund these expenses with proceeds from the Offering and/or acquisition-related indebtedness.  We had a liability of   $4.4 million   for acquisition fees payable to our Advisor as of   September 30, 2016  .  There was no such liability as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were primarily due to the following: 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 
             
    Payment of   $244.8 million   related to the acquisition of the Domain Apartments, Cottonwood Corporate Center and Goodyear Crossing II. 
                
    Payment of a   $5.0 million   earnest money deposit in connection with the potential acquisition of   Rookwood  . 
       
  Nine months ended September 30, 2015 
             
    Payment of   $102.7 million   related to the acquisition of Bishop s Square. 
                
    Increase in restricted cash of   $2.9 million   related to rent payments at Bishop s Square that were released by the lender subsequent to September 30, 2015.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Initial Public Offering 
    
  We commenced the Offering in August 2014 and met our minimum offering requirements for every state, except Washington and Pennsylvania, in September 2014 (the minimum offering requirements were met in March 2015 with respect to the state of Washington and December 2015 with respect to the state of Pennsylvania).  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we raised gross proceeds of   $104.5 million   and   $69.2 million  , respectively, from the Offering, excluding proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan.  In addition, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we redeemed   $414,170   in shares of common stock pursuant to our redemption program.    No   shares of our common stock were redeemed pursuant to our share redemption program for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  In addition to the investing activities described previously, we use proceeds from the Offering to make certain payments to our Advisor, our Dealer Manager and Hines and their affiliates during the various phases of our organization and operation.  During the organization and offering stage, these include, without limitation, payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution and stockholder servicing fees and payments to our Advisor for reimbursement of issuer costs.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we made payments of   $10.7 million   and   $10.8 million  , respectively, for selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution and shareholder servicing fees and issuer costs related to the Offering.  These selling commissions and dealer manager fees are lower for Class T Shares of our common stock than for Class A Shares.  Therefore, the decrease in the payment of these fees and commissions noted above is primarily due to a higher proportion of Class T Shares being sold during the current period.  In addition, we amended our Dealer Manager Agreement in July 2016 to reduce the dealer manager fees payable by us, as described previously. 
    
  Our Advisory Agreement was amended, effective February 29, 2016, to cap the amount which we will reimburse our Advisor for the cumulative issuer costs incurred in connection with our organization and our public offerings.  As a result of the cap on reimbursement as a percentage of gross offering proceeds, on April 14, 2016, our Advisor reimbursed us for   $4.0 million   in issuer costs that we had previously reimbursed in excess of this new 2.5% cap.  As we raise additional offering proceeds, we expect to reimburse our Advisor for the   $4.0 million   in issuer costs it recently repaid to us to the extent such costs do not exceed 2.5% of gross offering proceeds from our public offerings. 
    
  Distributions 
    
  With the authorization of the board of directors, we declared distributions with respect to Class A Shares of our common stock for the period from   October 1, 2014   through   November 30, 2016  .  For the period from   October 1, 2014   through   April 30, 2016  , distributions for Class A Shares were calculated based on stockholders of record each day in an amount equal to   $0.001575342   per share, per day.  The distribution rate per share, per day was increased effective   May 1, 2016  .  As a result, with respect to the period from   May 1, 2016   through   November 30, 2016  , distributions for Class A Shares were or will be calculated based on stockholders of record each day in an amount equal to   $0.001594766   per share, per day. 
    
  Also, with the authorization of the board of directors, we declared distributions with respect to Class T Shares of our common stock for the period from   August 24, 2015   through   November 30, 2016  .  For the period from   August 24, 2015   through   April 30, 2016  , distributions for Class T Shares were calculated based on stockholders of record each day in an amount equal to   $0.001575342   per share, per day less the distribution and stockholder servicing fees that were payable with respect to such Class T Shares (as calculated on a daily basis).  The distribution rate per share, per day was increased effective   May 1, 2016  .  As a result, with respect to the period from   May 1, 2016   through   November 30, 2016  , distributions for Class T Shares were or will be calculated based on stockholders of record each day in an amount equal to   $0.001594766   per share, per day less the distribution and stockholder servicing fees that are payable with respect to such Class T Shares (as calculated on a daily basis). 
    
  All distributions were or will be paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock for those participating in our distribution reinvestment plan and have been or will be paid or issued, respectively, on the first business day following the completion of the month to which they relate.  Distributions reinvested pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan have been or will be reinvested in shares of the same class as the shares on which the distributions are being made.  Distributions paid to stockholders during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $2.6 million   and   $835,458  , respectively, including those reinvested in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.  Distributions paid to stockholders during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $6.3 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively, including those reinvested in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. 
    
  We have not generated sufficient cash flows from operations to fully fund distributions paid.  Therefore some or all of our distributions have been and may continue to be paid from other sources, such as proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds  
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

from the Offering, cash advances by our Advisor, cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees and/or proceeds from the sale of assets.  We have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from any of these sources.  For example, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we funded   46%   of total distributions with cash flows from financing activities, which included offering proceeds.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we funded   9%   of total distributions with cash flows from financing activities, which includes offering proceeds.  Commencing with the quarter ended   December 31, 2014  , our Advisor agreed to waive the asset management fees for each quarter through   December 31, 2016  , to the extent that our MFFO, for a particular quarter, as disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K, as applicable, amounts to less than the aggregate distributions declared to our stockholders for such quarter.  As a result of these waivers, our Advisor waived   $1.0 million   and   $268,024   in asset management fees payable to it for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Also, as a result of these waivers, cash flows from operations that would have been paid to our Advisor for asset management fees may be available to pay distributions to stockholders.  These fee waivers are not deferrals and accordingly, any fees that are waived will not be paid to our Advisor in cash at any time in the future. 
    
  The following table outlines our total distributions declared to stockholders and noncontrolling interests (HALP II) for each of the quarters during   2016   and   2015  , including the breakout between the distributions declared in cash and those reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. 

Debt Financings 
    
  As mentioned previously, our portfolio was approximately   51%   leveraged as of   September 30, 2016   (  based on the most recent appraised values of our real estate investments or net purchase prices for properties acquired subsequent to February 2016  ) with a weighted average interest rate of   2.26%  .  Below is additional information regarding our loan activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  See    Note 5      Debt Financing for additional information regarding our outstanding debt. 
    
  2016 

We entered into   $141.3 million   of permanent mortgage financing related to the acquisition of the Domain Apartments, Cottonwood Corporate Center and Goodyear Crossing II and made payments of   $656,545   for financing costs related to these loans. 
                
    We borrowed   $25.5 million   under the Hines Credit Facility and made payments of   $25.5 million   on this facility, which resulted in us having   no   outstanding balance under this facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  2015 

We entered into   $61.8 million   of permanent mortgage financing related to the acquisition of Bishop s Square. 
                
    We borrowed   $50.3 million   under the Hines Credit Facility and made payments of   $60.6 million   on this facility. 
                
    We made payments of   $625,876   for financing costs related to our loans and   $47,876   for an interest rate cap related to the mortgage loan secured by Bishop s Square.

Results of Operations 
    
  We owned   five   properties that were   97%   leased as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   two   properties that were   100%   leased as of   September 30, 2015  .  As we are currently in the acquisition phase of our life cycle, changes in our results of operations related to our properties are primarily due to the acquisition of properties.  Amounts recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are due to the following: 

Total revenues, property operating expenses, real property taxes, property management fees, depreciation and amortization, and interest expense relate to the operation of our five properties since December 2014. 

Acquisition-related expenses represent costs related to the acquisition of our real estate investments, including those properties which we may acquire in future periods.  These costs vary significantly from one acquisition to the next.  For example, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a $2.0 million Stamp Duty tax related to the acquisition of Bishop s Square.  No similar acquisition expenses were incurred in relation to any of our acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

We expect to pay monthly asset management fees to our Advisor based on an annual fee equal to 0.75% of (i) the cost of our real estate investments or (ii) with respect to our real estate investments included in our board of directors  most recent determination of an estimated net asset value per share, the most recently determined value of such real estate investments.  As described previously, our Advisor agreed to waive asset management fees for each of the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , to the extent that our MFFO, for a particular quarter, is less than our distributions declared for such quarter.  As a result of these waivers, our Advisor waived   $268,678   and   $1.0 million   in asset management fees payable to it during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Further, our Advisor waived   $138,500   and   $268,024   in asset management fees payable to it during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

We pay our Advisor acquisition fees equal to 2.25% of the purchase price of our real estate investments.  Acquisition fees for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were higher than those for the corresponding period in   2015   due to an increase in our acquisition activity.  We acquired   three   properties for an aggregate purchase price of   $253.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   one   property for   $103.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 

General and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   primarily consist of legal and accounting fees, costs and expenses associated with our board of directors, transfer agent costs and insurance costs.  Certain of these costs are variable and will increase in the future as we continue to raise capital and make additional real estate investments.

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
    
  Funds from Operations ( FFO ) is a non-GAAP financial performance measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) and is widely recognized by investors and analysts as one measure of operating performance of a real estate company.  FFO excludes items such as real estate depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization, as applied in accordance with GAAP, implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and also assumes that such assets are adequately maintained and renovated as required in order to maintain their value.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions such as occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, it is management s view, and we believe the view of many industry investors and analysts, that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone is insufficient.  In addition, FFO excludes gains and losses from the sale of real estate and impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets and in-substance real estate equity investments, which we believe provides management and investors with a helpful additional measure of the historical performance of our real estate portfolio, as it allows for comparisons, year to year, that reflect the impact on operations from trends in items such as occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs.  A property will be evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the property).  Undiscounted future cash flows are based on anticipated operating performance, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows.  While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, stockholders are cautioned that due to the limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges. 
    
  In addition to FFO, management uses MFFO, as defined by the Investment Program Association, (the  IPA ), as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate our operating performance.  The IPA has recommended the use of MFFO as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs to enhance the assessment of the operating performance of a non-listed REIT.  MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be useful as a measure of the long-term operating performance of our investments or as a comparative measure to other publicly registered, non-listed REITs if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended and described herein.  MFFO includes funds generated by the operations of our real estate investments and funds used in our corporate-level operations.  MFFO is based on FFO, but includes certain additional adjustments which we believe are appropriate.  Such items include reversing the effects of straight-line rent revenue recognition, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and certain other items as described below.  Some of these adjustments are necessary to address changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP such as the accounting for acquisition-related expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP rules for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO.  These changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP affected all industries, and as a result of these changes, acquisition fees and expenses are typically accounted for as operating expenses under GAAP.  Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance.  These changes also have prompted a significant increase in the magnitude of non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO, as defined.  Such items include amortization of out-of-market lease intangible assets and liabilities and certain tenant incentives. 
    
  Other adjustments included in MFFO are necessary to address issues that are common to publicly registered, non-listed REITs.  Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operations.  While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs like us are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.  We will use the proceeds raised in our offerings to make real estate investments, and intend to begin the process of considering our alternatives for the execution of a Liquidity Event (i.e., a sale of our assets, our sale or merger, a listing of our shares on a national securities exchange, or another similar transaction) five to eight years following the end of the Offering.  Thus, as a limited life REIT we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life. 
    
  The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, including acquisition fees and expenses, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to our stockholders.  MFFO excludes acquisition fees payable to our Advisor and acquisition expenses.  Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income.  These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to our stockholders.  All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses with respect to the acquisition of a property negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which the property is acquired and will have negative effects on returns to our stockholders, the potential for future distributions, and future cash flows, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, the related acquisition fees and expenses and other costs related to such property.  In addition, if we acquire a property after all offering proceeds from the Offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs.  Accordingly, unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows.  Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired.  Since MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses, MFFO would only be comparable to the operations of non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics. 
    
  Management uses MFFO to evaluate the financial performance of our investment portfolio, including the impact of potential future investments.  In addition, management uses MFFO to evaluate and establish our distribution policy and the sustainability thereof.  Further, we believe MFFO is one of several measures that may be useful to investors in evaluating the potential performance of our portfolio following the conclusion of the acquisition phase, as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses, as described herein. 
    
  MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no net asset value determination during the offering stage and for a period thereafter.  MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed.  MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO. 
    
  FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance.  In addition, FFO and MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements.  Further, FFO and MFFO are not intended to be used as liquidity measures indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.  Please see the limitations listed below associated with the use of MFFO: 

As we are currently in the acquisition phase of our life cycle, acquisition costs and other adjustments that are increases to MFFO are, and may continue to be, a significant use of cash and dilutive to the value of an investment in our shares. 

MFFO excludes acquisition fees payable to our Advisor and acquisition expenses.  Although these amounts reduce net income, we generally fund such costs with proceeds from the Offering and/or acquisition-related indebtedness and do not consider these fees and expenses in the evaluation of our operating performance and determining MFFO. 

We use an interest rate cap as an economic hedge against the variability of interest rates on one of our variable interest rate borrowings.  Although we expect to hold this instrument to maturity, if we were to settle this instrument currently, it would have an impact on our operating performance.  Additionally, this derivative instrument is measured at fair value on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP.  MFFO excludes gains (losses) related to changes in the estimated value of our derivative instrument because such adjustments may not be reflective of ongoing operations and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. 

We utilize the definition of FFO as set forth by NAREIT and the definition of MFFO as set forth by the IPA.  Our FFO and MFFO as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs, if they use different approaches. 

Our business is subject to volatility in the real estate markets and general economic conditions, and adverse changes in those conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and MFFO.  Accordingly, the predictive nature of MFFO is uncertain and past performance may not be indicative of future results. 
       
  Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO.  In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.

     Table of Contents  

The following section presents our calculation of FFO and MFFO attributable to common stockholders and provides additional information related to our operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the period from inception through   September 30, 2016  .  As we are in the capital raising and acquisition phase of our operations, FFO and MFFO are not useful in comparing operations for the periods presented below.  We expect revenues and expenses to increase in future periods as we raise additional offering proceeds and use them to make additional real estate investments. 

Notes to the table: 
    
           (1) 
    Represents the depreciation and amortization of real estate assets.  Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that such depreciation and amortization may be of limited relevance in evaluating current operating performance and, as such, these items are excluded from our determination of FFO. 
       
           (2) 
    Includes income attributable to noncontrolling interests and all adjustments to eliminate the noncontrolling interests  share of the adjustments to convert our net loss to FFO and MFFO. 
       
           (3) 
    Represents components of net income (loss) related to the estimated changes in the values of our interest rate contract derivative.  We have excluded this change in value from our evaluation of our operating performance and MFFO because such adjustments may not be reflective of our ongoing performance and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. 

29 

     Table of Contents  

(4) 
    Represents components of net income (loss) primarily resulting from transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies.  We have excluded these changes in value from our evaluation of our operating performance and MFFO because such adjustments may not be reflective of our ongoing performance and may reflect unrealized impacts on our operating performance. 
       
           (5) 
    Includes the following components of revenues and expenses that we do not consider in evaluating our operating performance and determining MFFO for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the period from inception through   September 30, 2016  : 

(a) 
    Represents the adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms.  We have excluded these adjustments from our evaluation of our operating performance and in determining MFFO because we believe that the rent that is billable during the current period is a more relevant measure of our operating performance for such period. 
       
           (b) 
    Represents the amortization of lease incentives and out-of-market leases. 
       
           (6) 
    Represents acquisition expenses and acquisition fees paid to our Advisor that are expensed in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  We fund such costs with proceeds from the Offering and/or acquisition-related indebtedness, and therefore do not consider these expenses in evaluating our operating performance and determining MFFO. 
       
  Set forth below is additional information relating to certain items excluded from the analysis above which may be helpful in assessing our operating results: 

As noted previously, our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be insufficient to fund distributions to stockholders.  We may continue to choose to use proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from the Offering, cash advances from our Advisor, cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees and/or proceeds from the sale of assets to fund distributions to our stockholders.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we funded   46%   of total distributions with cash flows from financing activities, which includes offering proceeds.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we funded   9%   of total distributions with cash flows from financing activities, which includes offering proceeds.  As a result of the waivers described in   Executive Summary , our Advisor waived   $1.0 million   and   $268,024   in asset management fees payable to it for   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations, including proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from the Offering, cash advances by our Advisor and cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees. 
  From inception through   September 30, 2016  , we declared   $9.7 million   of cash distributions to our stockholders (including those reinvested in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan), compared to our total aggregate FFO loss of   $2.0 million   and our total aggregate net loss of   $16.3 million   for that period.  During the Offering and investment stages, we incur acquisition fees and expenses in connection with our real estate investments, which are recorded as reductions to net income (loss) and FFO.  From inception through   September 30, 2016  , we incurred acquisition fees and expenses totaling   $12.9 million  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we declared   $6.8 million   of cash distributions to our stockholders (including those reinvested in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan), compared to our total aggregate FFO of   $501,196  .  For the   nine months ended     September 2015  , we declared   $1.7 million   of cash distributions to our stockholders (including those reinvested in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan), compared to our total aggregate FFO loss of   $2.6 million  .

Related Party Transactions and Agreements 
    
  We have entered into agreements with our Advisor, Dealer Manager and Hines and its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees and reimbursements to these entities during the various phases of our organization and operation.  During the organization and offering stage, these include payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions, the dealer manager fee, distribution and stockholder servicing fees, and payments to our Advisor for reimbursement of issuer costs.  During the acquisition and operational stages, these include payments for certain services related to acquisitions, financing and management of our investments and operations provided to us by our Advisor and Hines and its affiliates pursuant to various agreements we have entered into with these entities.  See    Note 7      Related Party Transactions in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information concerning our related party transactions and agreements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market-sensitive instruments.  In pursuing our business plan, we believe that interest rate risk, currency risk and real estate valuation risk are the primary market risks to which we are exposed.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were exposed to the market risks listed below. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of debt used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $125.2 million   of variable-rate debt outstanding.  If interest rates were to increase by 1%, we would incur an additional   $1.3 million   in interest expense.  Additionally, in   March 2015  , we entered into an interest rate cap to limit our exposure to rising interest rates related to our mortgage loan secured by Bishop s Square.  See    Note 5      Debt Financing in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information concerning our outstanding debt. 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
    
  Our investment in Bishop s Square is subject to the effects of exchange rate movements between the Euro and the U.S. dollar, which may affect future costs and cash flows as well as amounts translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our condensed consolidated financial statements.  We have entered into a mortgage loan denominated in Euros for this investment, which provides a natural hedge with regard to changes in exchange rates between the Euro and U.S. dollar and reduces our exposure to exchange rate differences.  Additionally, we are typically a net receiver of Euros, and, as a result, our foreign operations benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar.  Based upon our analysis, a 10% immediate, unfavorable change in the exchange rate between the Euro and U.S. dollar would have decreased the net book value of our investment in Bishop s Square by approximately   $3.8 million   and would have reduced the net income (loss) of Bishop s Square by   $183,024  . 
    
  Other Risks 
    
  As described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Advisor has agreed to waive the asset management fee otherwise payable to it pursuant to our Advisory Agreement for each of the quarters in 2016, to the extent that our MFFO, for each respective quarter, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, amounts to less than 100% of the aggregate distributions declared for such quarter.  There can be no assurances that our Advisor will continue this waiver subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016, and if not, cash available to pay distributions in future periods may be reduced.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Change in Internal Controls 
    
  No changes have occurred in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 
    
  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we or our subsidiaries may become subject to legal proceedings, claims or disputes.  As of   November 9, 2016  , neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were a party to any material pending legal proceedings. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
    
  We are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  With the exception of the risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  We have and may continue to pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, including advances, deferrals or waivers of fees from our Advisor or affiliates, borrowings and/or proceeds of the Offering.  We have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from any of these sources.  The use of sources other than our cash flow from operations to fund distributions could adversely impact our ability to pay distributions in future periods, decrease the amount of cash we have available for operations and new investments and/or potentially impact the value or result in dilution of our stockholders  investment. 
    
  In our initial quarters of operations, and from time to time thereafter, our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to fund distributions to stockholders.  Our organizational documents permit us to make distributions from any source and we may choose to pay distributions when we do not have sufficient cash flow from operations to fund such distributions.  We may choose to use advances, deferrals or waivers of fees, if available, from our Advisor or affiliates, borrowings and/or proceeds of the Offering or other sources to fund distributions to our stockholders.  For example, we funded   46%   of total distributions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   23%   of total distributions for   2015   with cash flows from financing activities which includes offering proceeds.  In addition, our Advisor agreed to waive the asset management fee otherwise payable to it pursuant to our Advisory Agreement for the fourth quarter of 2014 and for each of the quarters in   2015   and   2016  , to the extent that our MFFO for each respective quarter, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, amounts to less than 100% of the aggregate distributions declared for such quarter.  Pursuant to this waiver agreement, our Advisor waived   $1.0 million  ,   $583,433   and   $16,258   in asset management fees payable to it during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and the years ended   December 31, 2015   and December 31, 2014, respectively.  We have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations, including proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our public offerings, cash advances by our Advisor and cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees.  However, our Advisor and affiliates are under no obligation to advance funds to us or to defer or, subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016, to continue to waive fees in order to support our distributions.  When we pay distributions in excess of earnings and we use cash flows from financing activities, including offering proceeds and borrowings, to fund distributions, then we have less funds available for operations and for acquiring properties and other investments, which could adversely impact our ability to pay distributions in future periods, may reduce our stockholders  overall return and may result in the dilution of our stockholders  investment.  In addition, our Advisor or its affiliates could choose to receive shares of our common stock or interests in the Operating Partnership in lieu of cash or deferred fees or the repayment of advances to which they are entitled, and the issuance of such securities may dilute our stockholders  interest in us.  Furthermore, to the extent distributions exceed cash flow from operations, a stockholder s basis in our stock will be reduced and, to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder s basis, the stockholder may recognize capital gain. 
  The actual value of shares that we redeem under our share redemption program may be substantially less than what we pay. 
  Under our share redemption program, commencing on October 31, 2016, shares may be repurchased at a price equal to the estimated per share NAV applicable to the class of shares being redeemed and most recently announced by us in a public filing with the SEC as of the applicable date of the redemption.  However, if the redemptions are sought upon a stockholder s death or disability, shares will be redeemed at a price equal to the price paid to acquire such shares from us; provided that, the redemption price cannot exceed the then-current offering price, in which case, the redemption price will be reduced as necessary to equal the then-current offering price for such class of shares being redeemed.  The estimated per share NAV and the price paid to acquire shares from us may not accurately represent the current value of our assets per share of our common stock at any particular time and may be higher or lower than the actual value of our assets per share at such time.  Accordingly,  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

we may redeem share at prices that are higher than the actual value of our shares, which would be dilutive to our remaining stockholders. 
  We have disclosed an estimated NAV per share of our common stock and the current purchase price our stockholders pay for shares of each class of our common stock in the Offering is higher than such estimated NAV per share.  Neither the estimated NAV per share nor the offering price may be an accurate reflection of the fair market value of our assets and liabilities and likely will not represent the amount of net proceeds that would result if we liquidated or dissolved or the amount you would receive upon the sale of your shares. 
  Due to rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and due to contractual obligations in the selling agreements between our participating broker dealers and our Dealer Manager, we may from time to time disclose an estimated NAV per share of our common stock.  The price at which we sell shares of our common stock is likely to be in excess of such estimated NAV per share.  For example, the estimated NAV per share of our common stock determined by our board of directors on April 13, 2016 of $9.03 per share is lower than the primary offering prices with respect to our Class A Shares and Class T Shares.  National Association of Securities Dealers, or  NASD,  Conduct Rule 2340, which took effect on April 11, 2016, sets forth the obligations of FINRA members to provide per share values in customer account statements calculated in a certain manner.  In accordance with this rule, the customer account statements that we issue to our stockholders will reflect the estimated NAV per share determined by our board of directors.  In addition, we expect to use the estimated NAV per share as the deemed estimated per share value for purposes of reports to fiduciaries of retirement plans.  Because we have used a portion of the proceeds from this offering to pay selling commissions, dealer manager fees and issuer costs in connection with our organization and the Offering, which reduce the amount of funds available for investment, unless our aggregate investments increase in value to compensate for these up-front fees and expenses, the estimated NAV per share, which will be the  value  shown on our stockholders  account statements, will be lower than the purchase price paid by our stockholders in the Offering. 
  The estimated NAV per share and the primary offering price per share of each class of our common stock are likely to differ from the price that you would receive upon a resale of your shares or upon our liquidation because: (i) there is no public trading market for the shares at this time; (ii) the primary offering price involves the payment of underwriting compensation and other offering-related costs, which are likely to produce a higher purchase price than could otherwise be obtained; (iii) the estimated NAV per share and the primary offering price per share do not take into account how market fluctuations affect the value of our investments, including how disruptions in the financial and real estate markets may affect the values of our investments; and (v) the estimated NAV per share and the primary offering price per share do not take into account how developments related to individual assets may have increased or decreased the value of our portfolio. 
  Further, the estimated NAV per share and the primary offering price of each class of our common stock may not be an accurate reflection of the fair value of our assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP, may not reflect the price at which we would be able to sell all or substantially all of our assets or the outstanding shares of our common stock in an arm s-length transaction, may not represent the value that stockholders could realize upon a sale of the company or upon the liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities, and may not be indicative of the prices at which Class A Shares or Class T Shares would trade if they were listed on a national securities exchange.  In addition, any estimated NAV per share that we disclose may not be the equivalent of the disclosure of a market price by an open-ended real estate fund. 
  The methodology used to determine the estimated NAV per share of our common stock may be based upon assumptions, estimates and judgments that may not be accurate or complete, such that, if different property-specific and general real estate and capital market assumptions, estimates and judgments were used, it could result in an estimated NAV per share that is significantly different. 
    
  The U.S. Department of Labor, or DOL, has adopted certain amendments, including an amendment to the definition of  fiduciary  under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, and the Code, which could impact our ability to raise significant additional capital in the Offering. 
  The DOL has adopted certain amendments, including an amendment to the definition of  fiduciary  under ERISA and the Code.  The amendments have broadened the definition of  fiduciary  and have changed the prohibited transaction exemptions relating to investments by employee benefit plans subject to Title I of ERISA or retirement plans or accounts subject to Section 4975 of the Code (including individual retirement accounts).  The amendments take effect between April 10, 2017 and January 1, 2018.  The ultimate impact of the amendments is not yet known, but when they take effect, they could have a significantly negative effect on the sale of shares of our common stock to such plans or accounts.

Geographic concentration of our portfolio may make us particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the real estate markets of those areas. 
  In the event that we have a concentration of properties in, or real estate investments that invest in properties located in, a particular geographic area, our operating results and ability to make distributions are likely to be impacted by economic changes affecting the real estate markets in that area.  Therefore, an investment in our common stock will be subject to greater risk to the extent that we lack a geographically diversified portfolio.  As of   September 30, 2016  , based on the estimated aggregate value of our real estate investments, approximately   7%   of our portfolio consists of a property located in Carlsbad, California, approximately   29%   consists of a property located in Dublin Ireland, approximately   15%   consists of a property located near Las Vegas in Henderson, Nevada, approximately   35%   consists of a property located near Salt Lake City in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, and approximately   14%   consists of a property located near Phoenix, in Goodyear, Arizona. 
    
  Industry concentration of our tenants may make us particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in these industries. 
    
  In the event we have a concentration of tenants in a particular industry, our operating results and ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by adverse developments in those industries and we will be subject to a greater risk to the extent that our tenants are not diversified by industry.  For example, based on leased square footage of our commercial real estate properties, as of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   52%   is leased to tenants in the retail industry, approximately   10%   is leased to tenants in the manufacturing industry, and approximately   12%   is leased to tenants in the information industry. 
    
  We will depend on tenants for our revenue, and therefore our revenue will be dependent on the success and economic viability of our tenants.  Our reliance on single or significant tenants in certain buildings may decrease our ability to lease vacated space. 
    
  We expect that rental income from real property will, directly or indirectly, constitute a significant portion of our income.  Delays in collecting accounts receivable from tenants could adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition.  In addition, the inability of a single major tenant or a number of smaller tenants to meet their rental obligations would adversely affect our income.  Therefore, our financial success will be indirectly dependent on the success of the businesses operated by the tenants in our properties or in the properties securing loans we may own.  Of our total rental revenue for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , approximately   24%   was earned from the Commissioner of Public Works in Ireland, a state agency of Ireland, whose lease expires in 2028 and   12%   was earned from Acushnet, a tenant in the manufacturing industry, whose lease expires in 2019.  The weakening of the financial condition or the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant tenant or a number of smaller tenants and vacancies caused by defaults of tenants or the expiration of leases, may adversely affect our operations and our ability to pay distributions. 
    
  Generally, under U.S. bankruptcy law, a debtor tenant has 120 days to exercise the option of assuming or rejecting the obligations under any unexpired lease for nonresidential real property, which period may be extended once by the bankruptcy court.  If the tenant assumes its lease, the tenant must cure all defaults under the lease and may be required to provide adequate assurance of its future performance under the lease.  If the tenant rejects the lease, we will have a claim against the tenant s bankruptcy estate.  Although rent owing for the period between filing for bankruptcy and rejection of the lease may be afforded administrative expense priority and paid in full, pre-bankruptcy arrears and amounts owing under the remaining term of the lease will be afforded general unsecured claim status (absent collateral securing the claim).  Moreover, amounts owing under the remaining term of the lease will be capped.  Other than equity and subordinated claims, general unsecured claims are the last claims paid in a bankruptcy and therefore funds may not be available to pay such claims in full.  In addition, while the specifics of the bankruptcy laws of international jurisdictions may differ from the U.S. bankruptcy laws described herein, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant tenant or a number of smaller tenants at any of the international properties we may acquire, may similarly adversely impact our operations and our ability to pay distributions. 
    
  Two   of our properties are and in the future, we may invest in additional properties that are leased to a single or significant tenant and, accordingly, may be suited to the particular or unique needs of such tenant.  We may have difficulty replacing such a tenant if the floor plan of the vacant space limits the types of businesses that can use the space without major renovation.  In addition, the resale value of the property could be diminished because the market value of a particular property will depend principally upon the value of the leases of such property. 

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we did not sell or issue any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ).

Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities 
    
  On   August 20, 2014  , the Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-191106) for the Offering was declared effective under the Securities Act.  The Offering commenced on   August 20, 2014   and is currently expected to terminate on or before   August 20, 2017  , unless extended by our board of directors. 
    
  From   August 20, 2014   through   September 30, 2016  , we received gross proceeds of approximately   $151.5 million   through the sale of   15.3 million   Class A Shares and   $62.8 million   through the sale of   6.6 million   Class T Shares to the public in connection with the Offering.  Since   August 20, 2014  , we have used proceeds from the Offering to pay   $16.3 million   of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, as well as   $5.0 million   of issuer costs related to the Offering.  See Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Issuer Costs for additional information regarding the amendment to our Advisory Agreement executed in April 2016 and effective February 29, 2016, which has reduced the amount of issuer costs payable to our Advisor as a percentage of gross offering proceeds.  As a result of the amendment to our Advisory Agreement, our Advisor reimbursed us for   $4.0 million   in issuer costs that we had previously reimbursed to our Advisor.  See Note 7  Related Party Transactions for additional information regarding the amendment of the Dealer Manager Agreement, pursuant to which our Advisor will pay a portion of the dealer manager fees payable to the dealer manager, without reimbursement from us.  The selling commissions and dealer manager fees were not paid with respect to the shares sold through our distribution reinvestment plan.  The selling commissions and dealer manager fees were paid to our dealer manager, which is an affiliate of Hines and is wholly-owned, indirectly, by, or for the benefit of, our Chairman, Jeffrey C. Hines and his father, Gerald D. Hines. 
    
  Net proceeds available for investment after the payment of the costs described above were approximately   $188.3 million  .  A portion of these proceeds, along with proceeds from debt financing, were used to make approximately   $186.2 million   of investments in real estate, including the purchase price of our investments, deposits paid for future acquisitions, acquisition fees and expenses, and costs of leveraging each real estate investment.  We had approximately   $1.2 million   in uninvested offering proceeds as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Additionally, we have not generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions paid.  From inception through   September 30, 2016  , a portion of our distributions have been funded with cash flows from financing activities, which includes offering proceeds.  See "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources   Distributions" for a description of the sources that have been used to fund our distributions. 
    
  Issuer Redemptions of Equity Securities 
    
  All eligible requests for redemptions that were received for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were redeemed using proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan.  The following table lists shares we redeemed under our share redemption program during the period covered by this report, including the average price paid per share. 

(1) 
    This amount represents the number of shares available for redemption on   September 30, 2016  .  Our share redemption program was first announced at the commencement of our initial public offering in   August 2014  .  Our share redemption program does not have a fixed expiration date, but it is subject to significant restrictions and limitations and our board of directors may terminate, suspend or amend the program without stockholder approval.  We may redeem shares on a monthly basis if the shares were held for at least one year and meet certain other conditions.  Any such redemptions will be limited to the amount required to redeem 5% of the shares outstanding as of the same date in the prior calendar year, and unless our board of directors determines otherwise, redemptions will be further limited to the amount of proceeds received from our distribution reinvestment plan in the month prior to the month in which the redemption request was received.  Per the terms of our share redemption program, we may waive the one-year holding requirement and limitations described above for share redemption requests made in connection with the bankruptcy, death or disability of a stockholder.
