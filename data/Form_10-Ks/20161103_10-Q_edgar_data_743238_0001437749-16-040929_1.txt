FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   
     
  There are certain statements within this Report that are not historical facts. These statements are called  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements involve important known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and can be identified by phrases using  estimate,   anticipate,   believe,   project,   expect,   intend,   predict,   potential,   future,   may,   will ,  should  and similar expressions or words. Our future results, performance or achievements may differ materially from the results, performance or achievements discussed in the forward-looking statements. There are numerous factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in forward-looking statements, including, among others:  

Changes in economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, credit availability, financial market performance and   our   industries can have adverse effects on its earnings and financial condition, as well as   our   customers, dealers and suppliers.      

Changes in relationships with major customers and suppliers could significantly affect   our   revenues and profits .    

Constrained government budgets may have a negative effect on   our   business and its operations.     

The integration of businesses or assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future involves challenges that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.     

When we introduce new products, we may incur expenses that we did not anticipate, such as start-up and recall expenses, resulting in reduced earnings.     

Amendments of the laws and regulations governing our businesses, or the promulgation of new laws and regulations, could have a material impact on   our   operations.     

We source components from a variety of domestic and global suppliers who may be subject to disruptions from natural or man-made causes. Disruptions in our supply of components could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position.     

Changes in the markets we serve may, from time to time, require us to re-configure our production lines or re-locate production of products between buildings or to new locations in order to maximize the efficient utilization of our production capacity. Costs incurred to effect these re-configurations may exceed our estimates and efficiencies gained may be less than anticipated.       
     
  This list provides examples of factors that could affect the results described by forward-looking statements contained in this Report. However, this list is not intended to be all inclusive. The risk factors disclosed in Item 1A  Risk Factors  of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I   Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, include all known risks our management believes could materially affect the results described by forward-looking statements contained in this Report. However, those risks may not be the only risks we face. Our business, operations, and financial performance could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. In addition, new risks may emerge from time to time that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We believe that the forward-looking statements contained in this Report are reasonable. However, given these risks and uncertainties, we cannot provide you with any guarantee that the anticipated results will be achieved. All forward-looking statements in this Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this Section and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this Report as a prediction of actual results. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise information contained in any forward-looking statement to reflect developments or information obtained after the date this Report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

NOTE 1 - GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
  For a description of key accounting policies followed, refer to the notes to the Spartan Motors, Inc. (the  Company ,  we ,  our  or  us ) consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2016. There have been no changes in such accounting policies as of the date of this report.  
     
  Spartan Motors, Inc. is a custom engineer and manufacturer of specialized motor vehicle chassis and bodies. Our principal chassis markets are emergency response vehicles, motor homes and other specialty vehicles. We also manufacture bodies for various markets including emergency response vehicles and delivery and service vehicles.  
     
  Our operating activities are conducted through our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Spartan Motors USA, Inc. ( Spartan USA ), with locations in Charlotte, Michigan; Brandon, South Dakota; Ephrata, Pennsylvania; and Bristol, Indiana; as well as contract manufacturing in Kansas City, Missouri; and Saltillo, Mexico. Spartan USA is the result of a consolidation of several of our subsidiaries, including Crimson Fire, Inc., Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc., and Utilimaster Corporation, into a single business entity.   
     
  Our Charlotte, Michigan location manufactures heavy duty chassis and vehicles and supplies aftermarket parts and services under the Spartan Chassis and Spartan ERV brand names. Our Brandon, South Dakota and Ephrata, Pennsylvania locations manufacture emergency response vehicles under the Spartan ERV brand name. Our Bristol, Indiana location manufactures delivery and service vehicles and supplies related aftermarket parts and services under the Utilimaster brand name, while our Kansas City, Missouri and Saltillo, Mexico locations sell and install equipment used in delivery vehicles. Spartan USA is also a participant in Spartan-Gimaex Innovations, LLC ( Spartan-Gimaex ), a 50/50 joint venture with Gimaex Holding, Inc. Spartan-Gimaex is reported as a consolidated subsidiary of Spartan Motors, Inc. In February 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. mutually agreed to begin discussions regarding the dissolution of the joint venture. In June 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. entered into court proceedings to determine the terms of the dissolution. The terms of the dissolution have not yet been determined, pending the outcome of the court proceedings.  
     
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of September 30, 2016, the results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and the cash flows for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
  The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  
     
  We are required to disclose the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Codification relating to  Disclosures about Fair Values of Financial Instruments.  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and our fixed and variable rate debt instruments approximate their fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   (Amounts in thousands, except per share data)   
     
   Recently issued accounting standards   
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in current practice regarding the manner in which certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the cash flow statement. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies the accounting for a stock payment s tax consequences by requiring the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also allows a company to elect to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis and revises the classification of certain tax payments related to stock compensation on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,  Leases  ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 requires net deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to adoption of the new standard, net deferred tax assets and liabilities were presented separately as current and non-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-17 as of the second quarter of 2016. As a result, we reclassified $3,164 of Deferred income tax assets (current) to Deferred income taxes, net (non-current) and $2,520 from Deferred income tax liabilities to Deferred income taxes, net. The December 31, 2015 balances in Total current assets decreased by $3,164, Other assets increased by $644 and Total assets and Total liabilities both decreased by $2,520.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330)   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 requires entities that measure inventory using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value to more closely align the measurement of inventory in Generally Accepted Accounting Practices with International Financial Reporting Standards. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal. ASU 2015-11 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   
     
  In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02  Consolidation (Topic 810), Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  ( ASU 2015-02 ). ASU 2015-02 modifies the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The amendments under the new guidance modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities, eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of the provisions of ASU 2015-02 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   (Amounts in thousands, except per share data)   
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. Early adoption for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 is permitted. On August 12, 2015, FASB delayed the effective date to give companies an extra year to implement the standard. The standard will be effective in 2018, but companies will have the option of adopting it as of the original 2017 effective date. We are currently evaluating the adoption method and the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ( ASU 2016-08 ). ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance for principal-versus-agent considerations in the revenue recognition standard. A principal-versus-agent consideration applies to sales that involve two or more suppliers to a customer. Each participant in the sale must determine whether they control the good or service and are entitled to the gross amount of the transaction or are acting as an agent and should collect only a fee or commission for arranging the sale. ASU 2016-08 will go into effect when the revenue standard issued in ASU 2014-09 becomes effective.  
     
  In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the implementation guidance in Topic 606 for identifying performance obligations and determining when to recognize revenue on licensing agreements for intellectual property. ASU 2016-10 removes the requirement to assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial to the contract with the customer and allows an entity to elect to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the good rather than as an additional promised service. ASU 2016-10 also includes implementation guidance on determining whether a license granted by an entity provides a customer with a right to use the intellectual property, which is satisfied at a point in time, or a right to access the intellectual property, which is satisfied over time. ASU 2016-10 will go into effect when the revenue standard issued in ASU 2014-09 becomes effective.  
     
  In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ). ASU 2016-12 clarifies the implementation guidance on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, non-cash consideration and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. ASU 2016-12 will go into effect when the revenue standard issued in ASU 2014-09 becomes effective.  

NOTE 2   INVENTORIES   
       
  Inventories are summarized as follows:  

We have a number of demonstration units as part of our sales and training program. These demonstration units are included in the  Finished goods  line item above. The net carrying amount was $4,125 and $2,857 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

   (Amounts in thousands, except per share data)   

NOTE   3           RESTRUCTURING   
     
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred restructuring charges related to efforts undertaken to upgrade production processes at our Brandon, South Dakota and Ephrata, Pennsylvania locations. Restructuring charges incurred in 2015 also included costs related to the relocation of our Ocala, Florida manufacturing operations to our Charlotte, Michigan and Brandon, South Dakota facilities.  
     
  Restructuring charges included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which were all related to our Emergency Response Vehicles segment, are as follows:  

NOTE   4   - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES   
       
  Under the terms of our credit agreement with our banks, we have the ability to issue letters of credit totaling $20,000. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $1,150 and $1,337 related to certain emergency response vehicle contracts and our workers compensation insurance.   
     
  At September 30, 2016, we and our subsidiaries were parties, both as plaintiff and defendant, to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of the normal course of our businesses. In the opinion of management, other than the Spartan-Gimaex dissolution discussion below, our financial position, future operating results or cash flows will not be materially affected by the final outcome of these legal proceedings.  
     
    Chassis Agreements     
  We are party to chassis bailment inventory agreements with General Motors Company ( GM ) and Chrysler Group, LLC ( Chrysler ) which allow GM and Chrysler to draw up to $10,000 against our revolving credit line for chassis placed at our facilities. As a result of these agreements, there was $3,043 and $3,795 outstanding on our revolving credit line at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Under the terms of the bailment inventory agreements, these chassis never become our property, and the amount drawn against the credit line will be repaid by a GM or Chrysler dealer at the time an order is placed for one of our bodies, utilizing a GM or Chrysler chassis. As such, the chassis, and the related draw on the line of credit, are not reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
     
    Warranty Related    
  We provide limited warranties against assembly/construction defects. These warranties generally provide for the replacement or repair of defective parts or workmanship for a specified period following the date of sale. The end users also may receive limited warranties from suppliers of components that are incorporated into our chassis and vehicles.

   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   (Amounts in thousands, except per share data)   
     
  Certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation, arbitration or litigation. Infrequently, a material warranty issue can arise which is beyond the scope of our historical experience. We provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and are estimable. It is reasonably possible that additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of our historical experience.  
     
  Changes in our warranty liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

Changes in liability for pre-existing warranties during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include $3,968 for campaigns and recalls outside of our normal warranty programs and $2,089 for changes in the estimated liability for existing warranties resulting from newly available claim data.   
            
    Spartan-Gimaex joint venture    
  In February 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. mutually agreed to begin discussions regarding the dissolution of the Spartan-Gimaex joint venture. In June 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. entered into court proceedings to determine the terms of the dissolution. Through December 31, 2015, we recorded charges totaling $1,217 to write down certain inventory items associated with this joint venture to their estimated fair values. There were no further charges recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Costs associated with the wind-down will be impacted by the final dissolution agreement. In accordance with accounting guidance, the costs we have accrued so far represent the low end of the range of the estimated total charges that we believe we may incur related to the wind-down. While we are unable to determine the final cost of the wind-down with certainty at this time, we may incur additional charges, depending on the final terms of the dissolution, and such charges could be material to our future operating results.

NOTE 6   TAXES   
       
  Our effective tax rate was -4.3% and -0.1% for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was impacted by a valuation allowance recorded in 2015 against substantially all of our deferred tax assets. We continue to anticipate the need for this valuation allowance in 2016. We expect that any tax provision or benefit that we record in 2016 based upon taxable income or loss will be offset by an equal adjustment to our valuation allowance. As a result, our tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 does not include a current year federal tax expense, but consists of state income taxes, adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions and a true-up of certain prior year tax provisions to the amount of tax anticipated to be paid based on the actual filing. Our effective rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were -894.5% and -185.2%, and differed from the statutory rates due to the valuation allowance recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.

NOTE   8   - BUSINESS SEGMENTS   
     
  We identify our reportable segments based on our management structure and the financial data utilized by our chief operating decision makers to assess segment performance and allocate resources among our operating units. We have three reportable segments: Emergency Response Vehicles, Fleet Vehicles and Services, and Specialty Chassis and Vehicles. Previously, we reported sales of aftermarket parts and accessories related to our emergency response vehicles, motor home chassis and defense vehicles as part of our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment. As a result of a realignment of our operating segments completed during the second quarter of 2016, aftermarket parts and accessories related to emergency response vehicles are now included in the Emergency Response Vehicles segment. Segment results from prior periods are shown reflecting the change.   
     
  Our Emergency Response Vehicles segment consists of the emergency response chassis operations at our Charlotte, Michigan location and our operations at our Brandon, South Dakota and Ephrata, Pennsylvania locations, along with our Spartan-Gimaex joint venture. This segment engineers and manufactures emergency response chassis and vehicles and distributes related aftermarket parts and accessories.   
     
  Our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment consists of our operations at our Bristol, Indiana location, along with our operations at our up-fit centers in Kansas City, Missouri and Saltillo, Mexico, and focuses on designing and manufacturing walk-in vans for the delivery and service market, the production of commercial truck bodies and the distribution of related aftermarket parts and accessories. This segment was formerly referred to as Delivery and Service Vehicles; however, there has been no change in the operations contained within this segment.

  On October 31, 2016, we repaid the $5,000 principal outstanding on our Series B Senior Notes due December 1, 2016, with cash on hand.  
     
  On October 31, 2016, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among us, certain of our subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent ("Wells Fargo"), and the lenders party thereto consisting of Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and PNC Bank (the "Lenders"). Under the Credit Agreement, we may borrow up to $100,000 from the Lenders under a three-year unsecured revolving credit facility. We may also request an increase in the facility of up to $35,000 in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The credit facility is also available for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $20,000 and swing line loans of up to $15,000, subject to certain limitations and restrictions. Interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility are based on either (i) the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5%, or the one month adjusted London interbank market rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.0%; or (ii) adjusted LIBOR plus a margin based upon our ratio of debt to earnings from time to time. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and covenants, including performance-based financial covenants on our part, which may limit our available borrowings under our line of credit. The Credit Agreement also prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness; limits certain acquisitions, investments, advances or loans; limits our ability to pay dividends in certain circumstances; and restricts substantial asset sales. The credit facility matures October 31, 2019, following which we have the option to renew the credit facility, subject to lender approval, for two successive one-year periods with an ultimate maturity date of December 31, 2021. We had no drawings against this credit line as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.

Item 2.    
 
   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.      
     
  Spartan Motors, Inc. was organized as a Michigan corporation on September 18, 1975, and is headquartered in Charlotte, Michigan. Spartan Motors began development of its first product that same year and shipped its first fire truck chassis in October 1975.  
     
  We are known as a leading, niche market engineer and manufacturer in the heavy-duty, custom vehicles marketplace. Our operating activities are conducted through our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Spartan Motors USA, Inc. ( Spartan USA ), with locations in Charlotte, Michigan; Brandon, South Dakota; Ephrata, Pennsylvania; and Bristol, Indiana; along with contract manufacturing in Kansas City, Missouri; and Saltillo, Mexico.   
     
  We recently completed a corporate reorganization in order to consolidate our U.S. operations into a single subsidiary and to simplify our corporate structure. On July 1, 2015, our former Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc. subsidiary (which operated our Charlotte, Michigan location) and our former Crimson Fire Aerials, Inc. subsidiary (which operated our Ephrata, Pennsylvania location) were merged into Spartan USA. On January 1, 2016, our former Utilimaster Corporation subsidiary (which operated our Bristol, Indiana location) was also merged into Spartan USA.   
     
  Our Charlotte, Michigan location manufactures heavy duty chassis and vehicles and supplies aftermarket parts and assemblies under the Spartan Chassis and Spartan ERV brand names. Our Brandon, South Dakota and Ephrata, Pennsylvania locations manufacture emergency response vehicles under the Spartan ERV brand name. Our Bristol, Indiana location manufactures vehicles used in the parcel delivery, mobile retail and trades and construction industries, and supplies related aftermarket parts and services under the Utilimaster brand name, while our Kansas City, Missouri and Saltillo, Mexico locations sell and install equipment used in fleet vehicles. Spartan USA is also a participant in Spartan-Gimaex Innovations, LLC ( Spartan-Gimaex ), a 50/50 joint venture with Gimaex Holding, Inc that was formed to provide emergency response vehicles for the domestic and international markets. Spartan-Gimaex is reported as a consolidated subsidiary of Spartan Motors, Inc. In February 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. mutually agreed to begin discussions regarding the dissolution of the joint venture. In June 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. entered into court proceedings to determine the terms of the dissolution. The terms of the dissolution have not yet been determined, pending the outcome of the court proceedings.  
     
  Our business strategy is to further diversify product lines and develop innovative design, engineering and manufacturing expertise in order to be the best value producer of specialty vehicle products. We have an innovative team focused on building lasting relationships with our customers. This is accomplished by striving to deliver premium specialty chassis and vehicles, vehicle components, and services that inspire customer loyalty. Our diversification across several sectors creates numerous opportunities while minimizing overall risk. Additionally, our business model provides the agility to quickly respond to market needs, take advantage of strategic opportunities when they arise and correctly size operations to ensure stability and growth.   

Executive Overview   

18

We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of long-term opportunities, and continue our efforts to bring product innovations to each of the markets that we serve. Some of our recent innovations and strategic developments include:  

Our diversified business model. We believe the major strength of our business model is market diversity and customization. Our Fleet Vehicles and Services and Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segments serve mainly business and consumer markets, effectively diversifying our company and complementing our Emergency Response Vehicles segment, which primarily serves governmental entities. Additionally, the fleet vehicles and services market is an early-cycle industry, complementary to the late-cycle emergency response vehicle industry. We intend to continue to pursue additional areas that build on our core competencies in order to further diversify our business.    

Our  Spartan Select  and  180 truck  programs, designed to provide the custom apparatus that emergency response professionals need with unprecedented order-to-delivery cycle times as short as 180 days.    

Spartan Connected Care, a new mobile application that provides owners of motor homes built on Spartan chassis with instant access to a pre-trip inspection checklist, coach-specific diagnostic codes and an interactive map to locate the closest Spartan authorized service center. Spartan Connected Care also provides notifications of events and rallies where owners can meet with Spartan engineers and service technicians, and participate in training sessions.    

The introduction of the Velocity, a new delivery vehicle design that combines the productivity of a walk-in van for multi-stop deliveries with the superior fuel economy of the Ford Transit chassis.    

The expansion of our alliance with Isuzu to include the assembly of Isuzu s new F-Series truck. This expanded relationship demonstrates Isuzu s confidence in Spartan s quality, people, flexibility and expertise and provides another positive example of our successful execution of our multi-year plan for improving performance.    

The award of a $3.6 million contract from the United States Postal Service to build fully functional prototypes for the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle Program further validating our focus on and investments in engineering, forward-looking technology and world-class manufacturing.    

The strength of our balance sheet, which includes robust working capital, low debt and access to credit through our revolving line of credit and private shelf agreement.     
        
  The following section provides a narrative discussion about our financial condition and results of operations. The comments should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2016.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
     
  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the components of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as a percentage of sales (percentages may not sum due to rounding):   

Quarter Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Quarter Ended September 30, 2015    
     
   Sales   
  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we reported consolidated sales of $148.7 million, compared to $136.6 million for the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $12.1 million or 8.9%. These results reflect increases in sales in our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment, which was partially offset by a decrease in sales in our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles and Emergency Response Vehicles segments. Please refer to our segment discussion below for more information about sales within our segments.   
     
   Cost of Products Sold   
  Cost of products sold was $130.7 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $123.8 million in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $6.9 million or 5.6%. This increase was mainly due to the higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. As a percentage of sales, cost of products sold decreased to 87.9% in the third quarter of 2016, compared to 90.6% in the third quarter of 2015, driven by a more favorable product mix in 2016, which included a higher proportion of higher margin aftermarket parts and accessories revenue than the third quarter of 2015.  
     
   Gross Profit   
  Gross profit was $18.0 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $12.8 million for the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $5.2 million, or 40.6%. Gross margin increased to 12.1% from 9.4% over the same time period, mainly due to the favorable product mix experienced in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 2015.    

20

Operating Expenses   
  Operating expense was $15.4 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $13.3 million for the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $2.1 million or 15.8%. Research and development expense in the third quarter of 2016 was $1.4 million, compared to $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $0.9 million, or 180.0%, driven by headcount increases undertaken in order to improve our ability to enact product enhancements and develop new products across business units. Selling, general and administrative expense was $13.8 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $12.4 million in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $1.4 million, or 11.3%. $1.6 million of this increase was due to higher incentive compensation expense recorded in 2016 based on financial results, while $0.6 million was due to higher legal and consulting spending in 2016 and $0.4 million was due to an increase in market development spending in 2016. These spending increases were partially offset by $1.2 million of the asset impairment charge recorded in 2015 that was charged to Selling, general and administrative. Restructuring charges were $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 60.0%, as a result of decreased spending on re-engineering in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment as projects are completed.  
     
   Taxes   
  Our effective tax rate was -4.3% for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was impacted by a valuation allowance recorded in 2015 against substantially all of our deferred tax assets. We continue to anticipate the need for this valuation allowance in 2016. We expect that any tax provision or benefit that we record in 2016 based upon taxable income or loss will be offset by an equal adjustment to our valuation allowance. As a result, our tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2016 does not include a current year federal tax expense, but consists of state income taxes, adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions and a true-up of certain prior year tax provisions to the amount of tax anticipated to be paid based on the actual filing. Our effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was -894.5% and differed from the statutory rates due to the valuation allowance recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.   
     
   Net Income   
  We recorded net income of $2.7 million, or $0.08 per share, for the third quarter of 2016, compared to a net loss of $5.8 million, or $0.17 per share for the same period in 2015. Driving the increase in net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the prior year were the factors discussed above.  
     
   Order Backlog   
  At September 30, 2016, we had $272.1 million in backlog compared to $275.3 million at September 30, 2015, a decrease of $3.2 million or 1.2%. This decrease is mainly attributable to a $5.4 million decrease in our Fleet Vehicles and Services backlog and a $2.4 million decrease in our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in our Emergency Response Vehicles backlog. We anticipate filling our current backlog orders for our Emergency Response Vehicles segment over the next 12 months, for our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment over the next 5 months and our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment over the next 3 months.  
     
  While orders in the backlog are subject to modification, cancellation or rescheduling by customers, this has not been a major factor in the past. Although the backlog of unfilled orders is one of many indicators of market demand, several factors, such as changes in production rates, available capacity, new product introductions and competitive pricing actions, may affect actual sales. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period-to-period is not necessarily indicative of eventual actual shipments.  
        
    Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported consolidated sales of $444.9 million, compared to $409.8 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $35.1 million or 8.6%. These results reflect increases in sales in our Fleet Vehicles and Services and Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segments, which were partially offset by a decrease in sales in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment. Please refer to our segment discussion below for more information about sales within our segments.   
     
   Cost of Products Sold   
  Cost of products sold was $390.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $368.0 million in the same period of 2015, an increase of $22.3 million or 6.1%. This increase was mainly due to the higher sales volume in 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of sales, cost of products sold decreased to 87.7% in 2016, compared to 89.8% in 2015, primarily driven by a more favorable product mix in 2016, which included a higher proportion of higher margin aftermarket parts and accessories revenue than in 2015.  

21

Gross Profit   
  Gross profit was $54.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $41.8 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of $12.8 million, or 30.6%. Gross margin increased to 12.3% from 10.2% over the same time period, mainly due to the higher proportion of higher margin aftermarket parts and accessories revenue experienced in 2016 compared to 2015.   
     
   Operating Expenses   
  Operating expense was $47.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $44.3 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of $2.7 million or 6.1%. Research and development expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.4 million, compared to $3.1 million in the same period of 2015, an increase of $1.3 million, or 41.9%, driven by headcount increases undertaken in order to improve our ability to enact product enhancements and improve product quality across business units. Selling, general and administrative expense was $41.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $39.2 million in the same period of 2015, an increase of $2.6 million, or 6.6%. Items contributing to the increase include $2.7 million for higher incentive compensation accruals in 2016 based on financial results, $1.2 million for increased marketing and trade show spending in 2016 and $0.9 million for increased legal, bad debt and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by the $1.2 million recorded for asset impairments in 2015 and a $1.0 million NHTSA penalty recorded in 2015. Restructuring charges were $0.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.0 million in the same period of 2015, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 60.0%, as a result of decreased spending on re-engineering in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment as projects are completed.  
     
   Taxes   
  Our effective tax rate was -0.1% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was impacted by a valuation allowance recorded in 2015 against substantially all of our deferred tax assets. We continue to anticipate the need for this valuation allowance in 2016. We expect that any tax provision or benefit that we record in 2016 based upon taxable income or loss will be offset by an equal adjustment to our valuation allowance. As a result, our tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 does not include a current year federal tax expense, but consists of state income taxes, adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions and a true-up of certain prior year tax provisions to the amount of tax anticipated to be paid based on the actual filing. Our effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was -185.2%, and differed from the statutory rates due to the valuation allowance recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.   
     
   Net Income   
  We recorded net income of $7.7 million, or $0.22 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $7.5 million, or $0.22 per share for the same period in 2015. Driving the increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the prior year were the factors discussed above.  
            
   Our Segments   
       
  We identify our reportable segments based on our management structure and the financial data utilized by our chief operating decision makers to assess segment performance and allocate resources among our operating units. We have three reportable segments: Emergency Response Vehicles, Fleet Vehicles and Services, and Specialty Chassis and Vehicles. Previously, we reported sales of aftermarket parts and accessories related to our emergency response vehicles, motor home chassis and defense vehicles as part of our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment. As a result of a realignment of our operating segments completed during the second quarter of 2016, aftermarket parts and accessories related to emergency response vehicles are now included in the Emergency Response Vehicles segment. Segment results from prior periods are shown reflecting the change.   
     
  Our Emergency Response Vehicles segment consists of the emergency response chassis operations at our Charlotte, Michigan location and our operations at our Brandon, South Dakota and Ephrata, Pennsylvania locations, along with our Spartan-Gimaex joint venture. This segment engineers and manufactures emergency response chassis and vehicles and distributes related aftermarket parts and accessories.   
     
  Our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment consists of our operations at our Bristol, Indiana location, along with our operations at our up-fit centers in Kansas City, Missouri and Saltillo, Mexico. This segment designs and manufactures walk-in vans and commercial truck bodies for the delivery and service market and distributes related aftermarket parts and accessories. This segment was formerly referred to as Delivery and Service Vehicles. There has been no change in the operations contained within this segment.

Financial Data      

(Dollars in Thousands)     

Comparison of the Three Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
     
  Sales in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment were $42.1 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $43.7 million in 2015, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 3.7%, driven by lower unit sales volume in 2016. There were no changes in pricing of products sold by our Emergency Response Vehicles segment that had a significant impact on our financial statements when comparing these periods.   
     
  Operating loss for our Emergency Response Vehicles segment was $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $5.6 million in 2015, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 32.1%. $2.2 million of this decrease was due to the asset impairment that was recorded in the third quarter of 2015, while $0.2 million of the decrease was due to improved manufacturing performance resulting from the production outsourcing of certain products and an additional $0.2 million decrease was due to the reduction in restructuring charges incurred in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million due to higher warranty related charges recorded in the third quarter of 2016.   
     
   Comparison of the Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
     
  Sales in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment were $135.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $151.2 million for the same period of 2015, a decrease of $15.6 million, or 10.3%, driven by lower unit volume in 2016. There were no changes in pricing of products sold by our Emergency Response Vehicles segment that had a significant impact on our financial statements when comparing these periods.   
     
  Operating loss for our Emergency Response Vehicles segment was $9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11.7 million for the same period of 2015, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 15.4%. $2.2 million of this decrease was due to the asset impairment recorded in 2015, $1.6 million of the decrease was due to a reduction in restructuring charges recorded in 2016, $0.7 million was due to the NHTSA fine recorded in 2015 and $0.4 million was due to savings from a sales department reorganization enacted in 2016. These savings were partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in warranty related charges recorded in 2016.

Fleet Vehicles and Services    

Financial Data      

(Dollars in Thousands)     

Comparison of the Three Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
     
  Sales in our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment were $78.0 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $54.2 million in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $23.8 million or 43.9% due to a $12.0 million increase in aftermarket parts and accessories revenue and $11.8 million due to a change in mix of vehicle sales. There were no changes in pricing of products sold by our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment that had a significant impact on our financial statements when comparing the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2015.   
     
  Operating income in our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment for the third quarter of 2016 was $9.6 million compared to $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $5.5 million or 134.1%, driven by an increase in aftermarket parts and accessories sales in 2016.

  Sales in our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment were $211.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $162.0 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of $49.1 million, or 30.3%, due to increases of $32.0 million in aftermarket parts and accessories revenue and $17.1 million in vehicle sales driven by higher unit volume in 2016. There were no changes in pricing of products sold by our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment that had a significant impact on our financial statements when comparing these periods.   
     
  Operating income for our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment was $21.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $10.0 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of $11.6 million, or 116.0%, driven by the increase in higher margin aftermarket parts and accessories revenue in 2016.

Financial Data      

(Dollars in Thousands)     

Comparison of the Three Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
     
  Sales in our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment were $28.6 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $38.7 million in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease of $10.1 million or 26.1%. Sales of motor home chassis decreased by $10.0 million in 2016, with the majority of the decrease due to lower unit volume in 2016 and $0.3 million of the decrease due to pricing changes enacted in the third quarter of 2016. Sales of aftermarket parts and accessories decreased by $1.8 million in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in sales of other specialty chassis in 2016 due to higher unit volumes. Other than the motor home pricing, there were no changes in pricing of products sold by our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment that had a significant impact on our financial statements when comparing the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2015.  
     
  Operating income for our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.9 million, compared to $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 62.5%. $0.3 million of this decrease was due to the motor home pricing changes enacted in the third quarter of 2016, while the remainder was driven by the lower sales volumes in the third quarter of 2016 as discussed above.  
          
   Comparison of the Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
     
  Sales in our Special Chassis and Vehicles segment were $98.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $96.6 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of $1.6 million, or 1.7%. $5.9 million of the increase was due to higher unit volume in other specialty chassis and vehicles in 2016, while motor home pricing changes enacted during 2016 accounted for $0.3 million of the increase (pricing change includes increases totaling $0.6 million during the first and second quarters and decreases totaling $0.3 million during the third quarter). These increases were partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease in sales of motor home chassis in 2016 attributable to lower unit volumes and a decrease of $2.1 million in sales of aftermarket parts and assemblies. Other than the motor home pricing discussed above, there were no changes in pricing of products sold by our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment that had a significant impact on our financial statements when comparing these periods.   
     
  Operating income for our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment was $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $4.8 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of $0.6 million, or 12.5%. $1.4 million of the increase was due to the NHTSA penalty that was recorded in 2015 and did not recur in 2016, while $0.3 million of the increase was due to the motor home pricing discussed above. These increases were partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in research and development expenses related to new product development in 2016, and a $0.9 million increase in sales and marketing costs in 2016.

Financial Condition   
         
    Balance Sheet at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015    
     
  Cash increased by $7.3 million, or 22.3%, to $40.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $32.7 million at December 31, 2015. Please see the discussion of cash flow activity below for more information on our sources and uses of cash in the first nine months of 2016.   
     
  Accounts receivable increased by $13.9 million, or 24.6%, to $70.5 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $56.6 million at December 31, 2015, due to higher sales volume in the latter half of the third quarter of 2016 compared to sales in the latter half of the fourth quarter of 2015.   
     
  Inventory increased by $7.4 million or 12.2% to $68.0 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $60.6 million at December 31, 2015, as a result of an increase in work in process inventory driven by inspection delays in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment and increased sales volume in our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment. Days inventory outstanding decreased to 47 days in the third quarter of 2016, compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter of 2015, mainly due to the impact of the higher sales, along with higher cost of goods sold, during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.  
     
  Income taxes receivable decreased by $1.1 million or 61.1% to $0.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $1.8 million at December 31, 2015 primarily due to recorded current year federal and state income tax liabilities.  
     
  Net deferred income tax assets increased by $2.7 million, or 450.0%, to $3.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $0.6 million at December 31, 2015 due to the reduction in the valuation allowance enabled by the current year tax expense.   
     
  Accounts payable increased by $16.8 million, or 61.5%, to $44.1 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $27.3 million at December 31, 2015 due to the timing of payments and the ramp up in production following our traditional  
  year-end shut down in December  .   
     
  Accrued warranty increased by $2.1 million, or 12.7%, to $18.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $16.6 million at December 31, 2015 due to additional accruals for various repair campaigns in 2016.  
     
  Accrued compensation and related taxes increased by $3.5 million, or 40.2%, to $12.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $8.7 million at December 31, 2015, mainly due to an increase in incentive compensation accruals as a result of our financial performance during the year.  
     
  Deposits from customers increased by $4.4 million, or 33.6%, to $17.5 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $13.1 million at December 31, 2015 due to more prepayments received than applied to invoices at our Emergency Response Vehicles segment. Deposits are made at the option of our customers and vary randomly from order to order.  
     
  Other current liabilities increased by $1.8 million, or 46.2%, to $5.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $3.9 million at December 31, 2015 mainly due to the timing of accruals for various expenses incurred but not yet invoiced.   
        
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
       
   Cash Flows   
     
  Cash and cash equivalents increased by $7.3 million to $40.0 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $32.7 million at December 31, 2015. These funds, in addition to cash generated from future operations and available credit facilities, are expected to be sufficient to finance the Company s foreseeable liquidity and capital needs.  

26

Cash Flow from Operating Activities   
       
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated $20.5 million of cash from operating activities, which represents a $22.4 million increase from the $1.9 million of cash that was used by operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash generated in 2016 results from our improved financial performance compared to the prior year along with changes in working capital, particularly increases in accounts payable and customer deposits, and accrued compensation.  
     
  See the Financial Condition section contained in Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding balance sheet line items that drove cash flows for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. Also see the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for the other various factors that represented the remaining fluctuation of cash from operations between the periods.  
        
   Cash Flow from Investing Activities   
     
  We utilized $9.3 million in investing activities in the first nine months of 2016, a $5.9 million increase compared to the $3.4 million utilized in the first nine months of 2015. This increase is mainly the result of expenditures of $4.6 million for the construction of our new assembly plant in Charlotte, Michigan as well as $1.2 million invested in our Bristol, Indiana facility as part of our relocation of truck body production for the Fleet Vehicles and Services segment to this location from our former Wakarusa, Indiana location.  
     
  During the remainder of 2016, we expect to make additional cash capital investments of $4.0 million to $5.0 million, including capital spending for the replacement and upgrades of machinery and equipment used in operations and approximately $2.0 million to $2.5 million for the new assembly plant in Charlotte, Michigan to be used for the manufacture of Isuzu F-Series trucks.  
        
   Cash Flow from Financing Activities   
     
  We utilized $3.9 million of cash in financing activities during the first nine months of 2016, compared to $2.4 million in the first nine months of 2015. This increase is primarily due to the repurchase of 421,692 shares of common stock at a total cost of $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2016.  
        
   Working Capital   
     
  Our working capital was as follows (in thousands):  

The change in our working capital at September 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, results from changes in cash, accounts receivable and inventory, which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable, accrued compensation, and deposits from customers. Refer to the balance sheet discussion appearing above in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for an explanation of the causes of the material changes in working capital line items.

Contingent Obligations   
     
  In February 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. mutually agreed to begin discussions regarding the dissolution of the Spartan-Gimaex joint venture. In June 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. entered into court proceedings to determine the terms of the dissolution. Through December 31, 2015, we recorded charges totaling $1.2 million to write down certain inventory items associated with this joint venture to their estimated fair values. There were no further charges recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Costs associated with the wind-down will be impacted by the final dissolution agreement. In accordance with accounting guidance, the costs we have accrued so far represent the low end of the range of the estimated total charges that we believe we may incur related to the wind-down. While we are unable to determine the final cost of the wind-down with certainty at this time, we may incur additional charges, depending on the final terms of the dissolution, and such charges could be material to our future operating results.  
        
   Debt   
     
  On October 31, 2016, we entered into a second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among us, certain of our subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent ("Wells Fargo"), and the lenders party thereto consisting of Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and PNC Bank (the "Lenders"). Under the Credit Agreement, we may borrow up to $100 million from the Lenders under a three-year unsecured revolving credit facility. We may also request an increase in the facility of up to $35 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $20 million, swing line loans of up to $15 million and revolving loans, subject to certain limitations and restrictions. Interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility are based on either (i) the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5%, or the one month adjusted London interbank market rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.0%; or (ii) adjusted LIBOR plus a margin based upon our ratio of debt to earnings from time to time. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and covenants, including performance-based financial covenants on our part. The credit facility matures October 31, 2019, following which we have the option to renew the credit facility, subject to lender approval, for two successive one-year periods with an ultimate maturity date of October 31, 2021. Commitment fees range from 17.5 to 32.5 basis points on the unused portion of the line. We had no drawings against this credit line as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our revolving credit facility was utilized, and will continue to be utilized in future quarters, to finance commercial chassis received under chassis bailment inventory agreements with General Motors Company ( GM ) and Chrysler Group, LLC ( Chrysler ). This funding is reflected as a reduction of the revolving credit facility available to us equal to the amount drawn by GM and Chrysler. See Note 4,  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details about these chassis bailment inventory agreements.  
     
  At September 30, 2016 we had $5.0 million of 5.46% Series B Senior Notes outstanding with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., with principal due December 1, 2016. We repaid the $5.0 million outstanding balance on the Series B Senior Notes on October 31, 2016 utilizing cash on hand.   
     
  Under the terms of our credit agreement with our banks, we have the ability to issue letters of credit totaling $20.0 million. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.1 million related to certain emergency response vehicle contracts and our workers compensation insurance.   
     
  Under the terms of the line of credit and the term notes detailed above, we are required to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions, which limited our available borrowings under our line of credit to a total of approximately $50.9 million at September 30, 2016 and $36.5 million at December 31, 2015. The agreements prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness; limit certain acquisitions, investments, advances or loans; limit our ability to pay dividends in certain circumstances; and restrict substantial asset sales. At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and, based on our current outlook for 2016, we expect to be able to meet these financial covenants over the next twelve months.  
     
  We had capital lease obligations outstanding of $0.2 million as of September 30, 2016 due and payable over the next five years.  

28

Equity Securities   
     
  In October 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the re-purchase of up to 1.0 million shares of our common stock. In April 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the re-purchase of up to 1.0 million additional shares of our common stock, and terminated the October 2011 authorization effective June 30, 2016. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased 421,692 shares at a total cost of $2.0 million under the October 2011 authorization. At September 30, 2016 there remains 1.0 million shares available for repurchase under the 2016 authorization.   
        
   Dividends   
     
  The amounts or timing of any dividend distribution are subject to earnings, financial condition, liquidity, capital requirements and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant.   
     
  On November 2, 2016 our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, payable on December 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on November 15, 2016.   
     
  On April 28, 2016 our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, which was paid on June 23, 2016 to shareholders of record on May 19, 2016.   
     
  On October 26, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, which was paid on December 17, 2015 to shareholders of record on November 12, 2015.  
     
  On May 8, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, which was paid on June 25, 2015 to shareholders of record on May 21, 2015.  
     
  The aggregate amount of dividends paid in 2015 was $3.4 million.  
            
   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
  The following discussion of critical accounting policies is intended to supplement Note 1 -  General and Summary of Accounting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2016. These policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units, and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods, assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related income statement, asset and/or liability amounts.  
     
    Revenue Recognition   - We recognize revenue in accordance with authoritative guidelines, including those of the SEC. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the buyer. On certain customer requested bill and hold transactions, revenue recognition occurs after the customer has been notified that the products have been completed according to the customer specifications, have passed all of our quality control inspections, and are ready for delivery. All sales are shown net of returns, discounts and sales incentive programs, which historically have not been significant. The collectability of any related receivable is reasonably assured before revenue is recognized.  
     
    Accounts Receivable   - We maintain an allowance for customer accounts that reduces receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we make certain assumptions regarding the risk of uncollectable open receivable accounts. This risk factor is applied to the balance on accounts that are aged over 90 days: generally this reserve has an estimated range from 10-25%. The risk percentage applied to the aged accounts may change based on conditions such as: general economic conditions, industry-specific economic conditions, historical and anticipated customer performance, historical experience with write-offs and the level of past-due amounts from year to year. However, generally our assumptions are consistent year-over-year and there has been little adjustment made to the percentages used. In addition, in the event there are certain known risk factors with an open account, we may increase the allowance to include estimated losses on such  specific  account balances. The  specific  reserves are identified by a periodic review of the aged accounts receivable. If there is an account in question, credit checks are made and there is communication with the customer, along with other means to try to assess if a specific reserve is required. The inclusion of the  specific  reserve has caused the greatest fluctuation in the allowance for doubtful accounts balance historically. Please see Note 1 -  General and Summary of Accounting Policies , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further details.  

29

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets     We perform our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1 of each year, or more frequently if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of our goodwill relates to our Fleet Vehicles and Services reportable segment, which was also determined to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.  
     
  The date of our most recently completed annual impairment testing was October 1, 2015. We performed a two-step impairment test, whereby the first step was comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined by estimating the future cash flows of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates, and then discounting the future cash flows at a market-participant-derived weighted-average cost of capital. Based on the results of the first step of our two-step impairment test we determined that the fair value of our Fleet Vehicles and Services reporting unit exceeded its carrying costs, and accordingly, there was no impairment of goodwill at the annual testing date.  
     
  We completed our most recent annual impairment testing for our indefinite-lived intangible asset, which consists of our Utilimaster trade name, as of October 1, 2015 by comparing the estimated fair value of the trade name with its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our trade name based on estimates of future royalty payments that are avoided through our ownership of the trade name, discounted to their present value. Based on the results of our impairment testing, we determined that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded its carrying cost at October 1, 2015, and accordingly, there was no impairment at the annual testing date.   
     
  Since October 1, 2015, there have been no events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our Fleet Vehicles and Services reporting unit or our indefinite-lived intangible asset below their respective carrying costs.  
     
  We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, the impact of the general economic environment; a material negative change in relationships with significant customers; strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions; and other risk factors as detailed in Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   
     
  See Note 1,  General and Summary of Accounting Policies  and Note 4,  Goodwill and Intangible Assets,  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further details on our accounting policies and other information regarding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  
       
    Warranties   - Our policy is to record a provision for the estimated cost of warranty-related claims at the time of the sale, and periodically adjust the warranty liability to reflect actual experience. The amount of warranty liability accrued reflects actual historical warranty cost, which is accumulated on specific identifiable units. From that point, there is a projection of the expected future cost of honoring our obligations under the warranty agreements. Historically, the cost of fulfilling our warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts and labor for field retrofit campaigns and recalls, which increase the reserve. Our estimates are based on historical experience, the number of units involved and the extent of features and components included in product models. Over time, this method has been consistently applied and has proven to be an appropriate approach to estimating future costs to be incurred. See also Note 4    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, for further information regarding warranties.  
     
    Provision for Income Taxes       
  We account for income taxes under a method that requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Authoritative guidance also requires deferred income tax assets, which include state tax credit carryforwards, operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.  
     
  We evaluate the likelihood of realizing our deferred income tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income, the projected reversal of temporary differences and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred income tax assets.  

30

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Although management believes the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.   
     
  Interest and penalties attributable to income taxes are recorded as a component of income taxes.   
     
   EFFECT OF INFLATION   
     
  Inflation affects us in two principal ways. First, our revolving note payable is generally tied to the prime and LIBOR interest rates so that increases in those interest rates would result in additional interest expense. Second, general inflation impacts prices paid for labor, parts and supplies. Whenever possible, we attempt to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of our products. However, we generally do not attempt to negotiate inflation-based price adjustment provisions into our contracts. Since order lead times can be more than twelve months, we have limited ability to pass on cost increases to our customers on a short-term basis. In addition, the markets we serve are competitive in nature, and competition limits our ability to pass through cost increases in many cases. We strive to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity.  

Item 3.    
 
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.      
     
  Our primary market risk exposure is a change in interest rates and the effect of such a change on outstanding variable rate short-term and long-term debt. At September 30, 2016, we had no debt outstanding under our variable rate short-term and long-term debt agreements. Therefore, an increase of 1% in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We do not enter into market-risk-sensitive instruments for trading or other purposes.  
     
  We do not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the primary market risk exposures or the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss to us. As of the date of this report, we do not know of or expect any material changes in the general nature of our primary market risk exposure in the near term. In this discussion,  near term  means a period of one year following the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in this report.  
     
  Prevailing interest rates and interest rate relationships are primarily determined by market factors that are beyond our control. All information provided in response to this item consists of forward-looking statements. Reference is made to the section captioned  Forward-Looking Statements  before Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the limitations on such statements.  

Item 4.    
 
   Controls and Procedures.      
     
  An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2016. Based on and as of the time of such evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   
     
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

   Other Information      
     
  On October 31, 2016, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among us, certain of our subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent ("Wells Fargo"), and the lenders party thereto consisting of Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and PNC Bank (the "Lenders"). Under the Credit Agreement, we may borrow up to $100 million from the Lenders under a three-year unsecured revolving credit facility. We may also request an increase in the facility of up to $35 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The credit facility is also available for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $20 million and swing line loans of up to $15 million, subject to certain limitations and restrictions. Interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility are based on either (i) the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5%, or the one month adjusted London interbank market rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.0%; or (ii) adjusted LIBOR plus a margin based upon our ratio of debt to earnings from time to time. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and covenants, including performance-based financial covenants on our part, which may limit our available borrowings under our line of credit. The Credit Agreement also prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness; limits certain acquisitions, investments, advances or loans; limits our ability to pay dividends in certain circumstances; and restricts substantial asset sales. The credit facility matures October 31, 2019, following which we have the option to renew the credit facility, subject to lender approval, for two successive one-year periods with an ultimate maturity date of December 31, 2021. The Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this 10-Q.

To request a W/C Swingline Loan, a Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 12:00 noon, Eastern time, on the day of a proposed W/C Swingline Loan or by such other time and by other procedures as may be agreed upon from time to time between the applicable Borrower and the Swingline Lender. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested W/C Swingline Loan and whether such W/C Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan or shall bear interest at an alternate rate agreed upon by the applicable Borrower and the Swingline Lender, and each W/C Swingline Loan shall bear interest at the ABR or at an alternate rate if agreed upon by the applicable Borrower and the Swingline Lender. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from any Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each W/C Swingline Loan available to the applicable Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the applicable Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a W/C Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the requested date of such W/C Swingline Loan.  
     
  (ii)        Procedures for Floorplan Swingline Loans . To request a Floorplan Swingline Loan, a Borrower, Manufacturer or such other person or entity as described below shall notify the Swingline Lender by such time and by procedures as may be agreed upon from time to time between the applicable Borrower and the Swingline Lender. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Floorplan Swingline Loan. Each Floorplan Swingline Loan shall bear interest as provided in Schedule 2.05(b)(ii) attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein. Upon request from time to time, the Swingline Lender will promptly advise the Administrative Agent of any such notice received from any Borrower, Manufacturer or other person and/or the then current Swingline Exposure. Each request for a Floorplan Swingline Loan, whether such request comes from a Borrower, from a Manufacturer, from some other person or entity under some drafting or similar type agreement, or from another dealer or third party with respect to (i) the acquisition by a Borrower of a Floored Item or (ii) a refinancing (take-out) of Vehicles financed with another floorplan (inventory) lender (each a  Floorplan Swingline Loan Request ), shall be in writing, in a form acceptable to the Swingline Lender, and shall be accompanied by such information the Swingline Lender may require from time to time, in its sole and absolute discretion, including copies of invoices, certificates, bills of sale, delivery tickets, title documents, ledger cards, statements of account, tax receipts, Manufacturer certificates of origin, Manufacturer repurchase agreements or repurchase options or inventory lists of prior floorplan (inventory) lender. The Swingline Lender may refuse to fund, or delay funding of, any Floorplan Swingline Loan Request until the Swingline Lender has reviewed, analyzed and approved such Floorplan Swingline Loan Request and all supporting documentation and information, which review and approval shall be for the purpose of determining that the Manufacturer, distributor or other seller has delivered the requisite documentation pursuant to the Swingline Lender s agreement with the Manufacturer. Floorplan Swingline Loans may be made by the Swingline Lender at its option directly to the requesting Borrower, to a Manufacturer, distributor or other seller of Floored Items, to any other person or entity in connection with the requesting Borrower s acquisition of Floored Items, or to the prior floorplan (inventory) lender of a Borrower. Each such Floorplan Swingline Loan, whether by depositing or transferring funds to, or for the account of, a Manufacturer, a prior floorplan (inventory) lender of a Borrower or by paying drafts in any other manner, shall be the same as if the Swingline Lender had issued funds directly to a Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall not be obligated to make any Floorplan Swingline Loan that exceeds 100% of a Borrower s net cost for any Vehicle, including freight charges and any associated Manufacturer s  hold-back , but excluding all other discounts, rebates, prizes, premiums, credits and everything else of value received by such Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Swingline Lender in its sole and absolute discretion may make a Floorplan Swingline Loan (in excess of the net cost, invoice, market reference guide price or purchase price limitations referenced in this sub-paragraph) that is equal to the outstanding principal balance of a Borrower s Vehicle inventory, as stated by the prior floorplan (inventory) lender.    

26

(c)        Payment of Floorplan Swingline Loans . The applicable Borrower shall cause the Manufacturer to forward all proceeds of Floored Items directly to the Swingline Lender for repayment of the Floorplan Swingline Loan which financed the purchase of such Floored Item.  
     
  (d)        Documentary Drafts . Each Borrower agrees that the Swingline Lender shall have no obligation to examine or review any document provided with any Floorplan Swingline Loan Request including, but not limited to, documentary drafts drawn on a Borrower. The Swingline Lender may conclusively rely on any invoice, advice or other document from a Manufacturer, distributor or other seller of Floored Items as being genuine, authorized and correct in all respects. Each Borrower hereby relieves and releases the Swingline Lender from any and all responsibility and liability whatsoever arising out of, or in any way related to, the correctness, genuineness, sufficiency, validity or authenticity of any invoice, advice or other document or instrument presented to the Swingline Lender for, or in connection with, any payment or for the existence, quantity, quality, condition, identity, packing, value, title, delivery, or any other aspect or quality, of the property purported to be described in, or represented by any such invoice, advice or other document or instrument.  
     
  (e)        Proceeds of Floored Items . Each Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall not use any proceeds received by such Borrower on account of the sale, lease, transfer, or placing in use of a Floored Item without first repaying, in full, the Floorplan Swingline Loan for such Floored Item.  
     
  (f)        Dealer Access System . Certain Borrowers have requested access to the Swingline Lender s internet web based  Dealer Access System  to permit such Borrowers to access certain account information relating to the Floorplan Swingline Loans and to facilitate the making of any payments on the Floorplan Swingline Loans by authorizing the Swingline Lender to debit any one or more of the applicable Borrower s deposit accounts with the Swingline Lender or with such other financial institutions as indicated by the applicable Borrower. In consideration for the Swingline Lender s granting to such Borrowers access to the Swingline Lender s Dealer Access System to view loan account information and make Floorplan Swingline Loan payments, each such Borrower acknowledges its responsibility for the security of its passwords and other information necessary for access to the Swingline Lender s Dealer Access System and fully, finally, and forever releases the Swingline Lender and its successors, assigns, directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives from any and all causes of action, claims, debts, demands, and liabilities, of whatever kind or nature, in law or equity, such Borrower may now or hereafter have, in any way relating to such Borrower s access to, or use of, or the Swingline Lender s suspension or termination of certain systems features of the Swingline Lender s Dealer Access System.    

27

(g)        Participation by Lenders . The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrowers (or other party on behalf of the Borrowers) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to any Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve any Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.  
     
  (h)        Settlement Among Swingline Lender and Lenders . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with respect to the Floorplan Swingline Loans:   
     
  (i)       It is agreed that, from and after the Effective Date, the Floorplan Swingline Loans are intended by Swingline Lender and Lenders to be shared pro rata by Lenders and Swingline Lender in accordance with their Applicable Percentages. Notwithstanding such agreement, Lenders and Swingline Lender agree that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement with respect to the Floorplan Swingline Loans, settlement between Swingline Lender and Lenders, in connection with the Floorplan Swingline Loans shall, subject to the provisions of clause (iv) below, occur on the last Business Day of each month (the  Settlement Date ) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.05(h).    

28

(ii)       Swingline Lender agrees to deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders within three (3) Business Days after each Settlement Date, a statement of account with the Borrowers in respect of the Floorplan Swingline Loans for the preceding month. Such monthly statement of account shall state the net Floorplan Swingline Loan balance, and the net amount (excluding any payments of interest, which shall be settled pursuant to clause (iii) hereof) due from a Lender to Swingline Lender, such that such Lender has paid to Swingline Lender its appropriate amount of the applicable Floorplan Swingline Loans. Such payments shall be made in immediately available funds and, absent manifest error, Swingline Lender s books and records showing the statements of account rendered to each Lender shall be considered accurate unless objected to by a Lender within sixty (60) days from the date the statements of account were rendered to such Lender. If such notice is given by 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time), each Lender, or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, will on such day, by 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time), pay the net amount. If such statement is given after 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) each Lender, or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, shall make such payments no later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on the next Business Day.  
     
  (iii)       Swingline Lender agrees to pay and otherwise account for, to Lenders, no later than the third (3rd) Business Day of each month, the interest due Lenders in respect of its Applicable Percentage in respect of Floorplan Swingline Loans funded during the previous calendar month, as such interest is earned and paid by the applicable Borrower, pursuant to the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Agreement. Lenders shall receive interest to the extent of its Applicable Percentage at the interest rate in respect of the closing daily balances in the applicable Borrower s Floorplan Swingline Loans account for each day during the immediately preceding calendar month to the extent such amounts were funded by Lenders and as such interest was earned and received by Swingline Lender from the applicable Borrowers pursuant to the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Agreement.  
     
  (iv)       Swingline Lender shall have the right at any time to require, by notice to the Lenders (delivered as set forth below), that all settlements in respect of Floorplan Swingline Loans made, and repayments of any amounts outstanding under this Agreement with respect to the Floorplan Swingline Loans be made on the last Business Day of each week or a daily basis (in either case, the  Alternative Settlement Date ). Swingline Lender shall deliver written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders two (2) Business Days prior to the effectiveness of any such Alternative Settlement Date, unless an Unmatured Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under any of the Loan Documents, in which case such written notice may be delivered prior to 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on the Business Day prior to the date such Alternative Settlement Date is to be effective. From and after the giving of such notice (and until such time, if any, as Swingline Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of its determination to return to another settlement date), each Lender shall pay to Swingline Lender such Lender s ratable portion of the amount of any Floorplan Swingline Loan to be made under this Agreement (x) in the case of a daily Alternative Settlement Basis, on the date such Floorplan Swingline Loan is made provided that Lenders receive notice of the Floorplan Swingline Loan by 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time), or by 1:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on the following Business Day in the event Lenders receive notice after 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) of a Floorplan Swingline Loan and (y) in the case of a weekly Alternative Settlement Basis, on a basis similar to that described in clause (ii) of this Section 2.05(h) (and as shall be more fully described in the applicable notice of Alternative Settlement Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that in the event that on any Business Day, after giving effect to the payments received for, or collections on account of, any Floorplan Swingline Loan, the principal amount of such Floorplan Swingline Loan funded by Lenders based on their respective Applicable Percentage exceeds the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Floorplan Swingline Loan, Swingline Lender shall have the right to require, by notice to Lenders, that settlements with respect to such Floorplan Swingline Loan be made on such day, so long as written notice is delivered to Lenders prior to 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on such day, or on the next succeeding Business Day, if such notice is received after 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on such date.    

29

(v)       Swingline Lender and Lenders each acknowledge and agree that it is for the convenience of the parties to this Agreement that funding of Floorplan Swingline Loans under the this Agreement by Lenders and allocation of collections in respect of such Floorplan Swingline Loans between Swingline Lender and Lenders will occur on the basis of the settlement procedures described in this Section 2.05(h). For the avoidance of doubt, Swingline Lender and Lenders hereby acknowledge and agree, that Lender s obligation to fund its Applicable Percentage of any Floorplan Swingline Loan funded under this Agreement by Swingline Lender shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against Swingline Lender, any Borrower or any other party for any reason whatsoever (except Lender s right of set off with respect to amounts otherwise payable by Swingline Lender to such Lender hereunder and wrongfully withheld by Swingline Lender); (B) the occurrence or continuance of any Unmatured Default or Event of Default; (C) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or any other party; or (D) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. If a Lender does not make available to Swingline Lender the amount required pursuant to clause (ii) above, Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date of non-payment until such amount is paid in full, at the Federal Funds Rate.  
     
  (vi)       If any amounts received by Swingline Lender hereunder are later required to be returned or repaid by Swingline Lender to the Borrowers, whether by court order, settlement or otherwise, each Lender shall, upon demand by Swingline Lender, pay to Swingline Lender an amount equal to Lender s Applicable Percentage of all such amounts required to be returned by Swingline Lender.  
     
  (vii)       If a Lender shall, at any time, fail to make any payment to Swingline Lender required hereunder, Swingline Lender may, but shall not be required to, retain payments that would otherwise be made to such Lender hereunder and apply such payments to such Lender s defaulted obligations hereunder, at such time, and in such order, as Swingline Lender may elect in its sole and absolute discretion.    

30

(viii)       With respect to the payment of any funds under this Section 2.05(h), whether from Swingline Lender to a Lender or from a Lender to Swingline Lender, the party failing to make full payment when due pursuant to the terms hereof shall, upon written demand by the other party, pay such amount together with interest on such amount at the Federal Funds Rate.  
     
  (i)        Independent   Swingline Lender Obligations . The failure of any Swingline Lender to make its Swingline Loan shall not relieve any other Swingline Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its Swingline Loan on the date of such Swingline Loan, but no Swingline Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Swingline Lender to make a Swingline Loan.  
     
  SECTION 2.06.    Letters of Credit . (a)  General . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or any Foreign Currency for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the applicable Borrower to, or entered into by the applicable Borrower with, the applicable Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, each Existing Letter of Credit shall, without any further action by any party, be deemed to have been issued as a Letter of Credit hereunder on the Effective Date and shall for all purposes hereof be treated as a Letter of Credit under this Agreement.  
     
  (b)        Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions . To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the applicable Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $20,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the total Commitments.    

31

(c)        Expiration Date . Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (provided that Letters of Credit having a one-year tenor may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods, but not extending beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) below) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date (the  L/C Maturity Date ), except that Borrowers may request Letters of Credit with an aggregate L/C Exposure not to exceed $1,000,000 with a term in excess of one year and/or with an expiration date beyond the L/C Maturity Date, but not beyond October 31, 2020, provided, however, that with respect to any such Letter of Credit with an expiration subsequent to the L/C Maturity Date, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders or Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure may from time to time demand delivery of Cash Collateral on any Business Day commencing on the L/C Maturity Date, and on the Business Day that the applicable Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders or Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure demanding the deposit of Cash Collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the applicable Borrower shall fully Cash Collateralize the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Such Cash Collateral shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the applicable Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the applicable Borrower s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Subject to other applicable provisions of this Agreement regarding the application of Cash Collateral in relation to L/C Exposure following the occurrence of an Event of Default, moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the applicable Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time.  
     
  (d)        Participations . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.    

32

(e)        Reimbursement . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 3:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the applicable Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the applicable Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 3:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the applicable Borrower receives such notice;  provided  that the applicable Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the applicable Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the applicable Borrower fails to make such payment when due, such amount, if denominated in Foreign Currency shall be converted to Dollars and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the applicable Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the applicable Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply,  mutatis   mutandis , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the applicable Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.  
     
  (f)        Obligations   Absolute . Each Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the applicable Borrower s obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank;  provided  that nothing in this subsection 2.06(f) shall be construed to excuse the applicable Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) suffered by the applicable Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.    

33

(g)        Disbursement Procedures . The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;  provided  that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.  
     
  (h)        Interim Interest . If the applicable Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the applicable Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans (or in the case such LC Disbursement is denominated in a Foreign Currency, at the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost of funding such amount plus the then Applicable Rate with respect to Eurodollar Loans);  provided  that, if the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.  
     
  (i)        Replacement of an Issuing Bank . An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the applicable Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term  Issuing Bank  shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous or other Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous and other Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.    

34

(j)        Cash Collateralization . If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the applicable Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of Cash Collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the applicable Borrower shall fully Cash Collateralize the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;  provided  that the obligation to deposit such Cash Collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the applicable Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such Cash Collateral shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the applicable Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the applicable Borrower s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the applicable Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the applicable Borrower under this Agreement. If a Borrower is required to provide an amount of Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the applicable Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.  
     
  (k)        I  nformation to Administrative Agent and Lenders . Promptly following any change in any Letters of Credit outstanding, the applicable Issuing Bank shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Borrowers a notice describing the aggregate amount of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank outstanding at such time. Upon the request of any Lender from time to time, an Issuing Bank shall deliver any other information reasonably requested by such Lender with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank then outstanding. Other than as set forth in this subsection, an Issuing Bank shall have no duty to notify the Lenders regarding the issuance or other matters regarding Letters of Credit issued hereunder. The failure of an Issuing Bank to perform its requirements under this subsection shall not relieve any Lender from its obligations under the immediately preceding subsection (d).  
     
  SECTION 2.07.    Funding of Borrowings . (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, Eastern time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, either (i) to an account of the applicable Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent, or (ii) via wire transfer pursuant to instructions provided by the applicable Borrower, in each case as designated by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.  

35

(b)       Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the applicable Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing.  
     
  SECTION 2.08.    Interest Elections . (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued .   
     
  (b)       To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the applicable Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the applicable Borrower.  
     
  (c)       Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:  
     
  (i)       the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);    

36

(ii)       the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;  
     
  (iii)       whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and  
     
  (iv)       if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term  Interest Period . If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month s duration.  
     
  (d)       Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing.  
     
  (e)       If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.  
     
  SECTION 2.09.    Termination and Reduction of Commitments . (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.  
     
  (b)       The Borrowers may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrowers shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.   
     
  (c)       The Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrowers pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrowers may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrowers (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.    

37

SECTION 2.10.    Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt . (a) The Borrowers hereby unconditionally promise to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date, and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earliest of (x) the Maturity Date, (y) the date five (5) Business Days after demand by the Swingline Lender in its discretion if no Event of Default exists and (z) the demand by the Swingline Lender in its discretion if an Event of Default exists. The Obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the Loan Documents are joint and several.  
     
  (b)       Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.  
     
  (c)       The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender s share thereof.  
     
  (d)       The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be  prima   facie  evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein absent manifest error; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  
     
  (e)       Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrowers shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).  
     
  SECTION 2.11.    Prepayment of Loans . (a) Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.  
     
  (b)       The applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Eastern time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Eastern time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, Eastern time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.    

38

(a) The Borrowers agree to pay, on a joint and several basis, to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of the Available Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  
     
  (b)       The Borrowers agree to pay, on a joint and several basis, (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender s LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender s Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the applicable Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Bank s standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.

39

(c)       The Borrowers agree to pay, on a joint and several basis, to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative Agent.  
     
  (d)       The Borrowers agree to pay, on a joint and several basis, to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender an upfront fee as set forth in the Fee Letter.  
     
  (e)       All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to an Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.  
     
  SECTION 2.13.    Interest . (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate.  
     
  (b)       The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.  
     
  (c)       Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.  
     
  (d)       Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.  
     
  (e)       All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  
     
  SECTION 2.14.    Alternate Rate of Interest . If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:    

40

(a)       the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or  
     
  (b)       the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.  
     
  SECTION 2.15.    Increased Costs  . (a) If any Change in Law shall:   
     
  (i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or  
     
  (ii)       impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  
     
  (b)       If any Lender or an Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered.    

41

(c)       A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  
     
  (d)       Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  
     
  SECTION 2.16.    Break Funding Payments . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  
     
  SECTION 2.17.    Taxes . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.    

42

(b)       In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.  
     
  (c)       Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  
     
  (d)       As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  
     
  (e)       (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in  Section   2.17(e  )(ii)(A) ,  (ii)(B)  and  (ii)(D)  below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  
     
  (ii)       Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:  
     
  (A)       Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from United States federal backup withholding tax;    

43

(B)       any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  
     
  (1)     in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty;  
     
  (2)     executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;  
     
  (3)     in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit C to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a   U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate  ) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or  
     
  (4)     to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit C, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;  provided  that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit C on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;  
     
  (C)       any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and    

44

(D)       if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  
     
  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  
     
  (f)       If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that each Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrowers or any other Person.  
     
  SECTION 2.18.    Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs . (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, Eastern time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at such office designated by the Administrative Agent, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of (i) principal or interest in respect of any Loan shall be made in Dollars, (ii) reimbursement obligations shall be made in the currency in which the Letter of Credit in respect of which such reimbursement obligation exists is denominated and (iii) any other amount due hereunder or under another Loan Document shall be made in Dollars.    

45

(b)       If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.  
     
  (c)       If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.  
     
  (d)       Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.    

46

(e)       If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.  
     
  SECTION 2.19.    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.  
     
  (b)       If any Lender (i) shall become affected by any of the changes or events described in Section 2.15 or 2.17 and any Borrower is required to pay additional amounts or make indemnity payments with respect to the Lender thereunder, (ii) is a Defaulting Lender or (iii) has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination which pursuant to the terms of Section 9.02 or any other provision of any Loan Document requires the consent of all affected Lenders and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent (any such Lender being hereinafter referred to as a  Departing Lender ), then in such case, the Borrowers may, upon at least five Business Days  notice to the Administrative Agent and such Departing Lender (or such shorter notice period specified by the Administrative Agent), designate a replacement lender acceptable to the Administrative Agent (a  Replacement Lender ) to which such Departing Lender shall, subject to its receipt (unless a later date for the remittance thereof shall be agreed upon by the Borrowers and the Departing Lender) of all amounts owed to such Departing Lender under Sections 2.15 or 2.17, assign all (but not less than all) of its interests, rights, obligations, Loans and Commitments hereunder; provided, that the Departing Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the Replacement Lender (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts). Upon any assignment by any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.19 becoming effective, the Replacement Lender shall thereupon be deemed to be a  Lender  for all purposes of this Agreement (unless such Replacement Lender was, itself, a Lender prior thereto) and such Departing Lender shall thereupon cease to be a  Lender  for all purposes of this Agreement and shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder (other than pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17 and Section 9.03) while such Departing Lender was a Lender.    

47

(c)       Notwithstanding any Departing Lender s failure or refusal to assign its rights, obligations, Loans and Commitments under this Section 2.19, the Departing Lender shall cease to be a  Lender  for all purposes of this Agreement and the Replacement Lender shall be substituted therefor upon payment to the Departing Lender by the Replacement Lender of all amounts set forth in this Section 2.19 without any further action of the Departing Lender.  
     
  SECTION 2.20.    Defaulting Lenders . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:  
     
  (a)        Waivers   and Amendments . Such Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.  
     
  (b)        Defaulting Lender   Waterfall . Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:  first , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;  second , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder;  third , to Cash Collateralize each Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with subsection (e) below;  fourth , as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Unmatured Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;  fifth , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize any Issuing Bank s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with subsection (e) below;  sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;  seventh , so long as no Unmatured Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and  eighth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;  provided  that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LC Disbursements, in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Article IV. were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Disbursements owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in LC Exposure and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (determined without giving effect to subsection (d) of this Section 2.20 below). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.    

48

(c)        Certain Fees .  
     
  (i)       No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 2.12(a)   for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).  
     
  (ii)       Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive payable under Section   2.12(b) participation fees with respect to Letters of Credit for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section 2.20 below  .  
     
  (iii)       With respect to any fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to the immediately preceding clauses (i) or (ii), the Borrowers shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to the immediately following subsection (d), (y) pay to each Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Bank s or Swingline Lender s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.  
     
  (d)        Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure . All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in LC Exposure and Swingline Exposure shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (determined without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Article IV are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrowers shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation.  
     
  (e)       Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans.  
     
  (i)       If the reallocation described in the immediately preceding subsection (d) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lender s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize each Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subsection.    

49

(ii)       At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within 1 Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers shall Cash Collateralize each Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to the immediately preceding subsection (d) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the aggregate Fronting Exposure of the Issuing Banks with respect to Letters of Credit issued and outstanding at such time.  
     
  (iii)       The Borrowers, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks, and agree to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders  obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Exposure, to be applied pursuant to the immediately following clause (iv). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the aggregate Fronting Exposure of the Issuing Banks with respect to Letters of Credit issued and outstanding at such time, the Borrowers will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).  
     
  (iv)       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Exposure (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.  
     
  (v)       Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any Issuing Bank s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this subsection following (x) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (y) the determination by the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank that there exists excess Cash Collateral;  provided  that, subject to the preceding subsection (b) of this Section 2.20, the Person providing Cash Collateral and any applicable Issuing Bank may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure.  
     
  (f)        Defaulting Lender Cure . If the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (determined without giving effect to the immediately preceding subsection (d)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;  provided  that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and  provided ,  further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender.    

50

(g)        New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit . So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Loan and (ii) no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.

  The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.  
     
  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by a Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Documents, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.    

67

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  
     
  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  
     
  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrowers. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, subject to the consent of the Borrowers (provided no Event of Default then exists), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.  
     
  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

  (A)       except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of any Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;  
     
  (B)       each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, provided that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;  
     
  (C)       the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and

For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term  Approved Fund  has the following meaning:  
     
    Approved Fund   means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.  
     
  (iii)       Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.  
     
  (iv)       The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the   Register  ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  
     
  (v)       Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.    

73

(b)       (i)     Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a   Participant  ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;  provided  that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Lender may not sell a participation to a Borrower or any of their respective Affiliates.  
     
  (ii)       A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers  prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.  
     
  (c)       Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.    

74

SECTION 9.05.    Survival . All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  
     
  SECTION 9.06.    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or electronic means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.  
     
  SECTION 9.07.    Severability . Any provision of any Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.  
     
  SECTION 9.08.    Right of Setoff . If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower or any Guarantor against any of and all the Obligations held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

75

(b)       Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Michigan, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such courts in Michigan. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

  (c)       Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.  
     
  (d)       Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.  
     
  SECTION 9.10.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL . EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates  directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by any Requirement of Law or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to any Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrowers or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Borrower. For the purposes of this Section,  Information  means all information received from any Borrower relating to any Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by a Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from a Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

SECTION 9.13.    Interest Rate Limitation . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under Applicable Law (collectively the   Charges  ), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the   Maximum Rate  ) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with Applicable Law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.  
     
  SECTION 9.14.    Joint and Several Obligations: Contribution Rights; Savings Clause . (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are joint and several.  
     
  (b)       If any Borrower makes a payment in respect of the Obligations it shall have the rights of contribution set forth below against the other Borrowers; provided that such Borrower shall not exercise its right of contribution until all the Obligations shall have been finally paid in full in cash. If any Borrower makes a payment in respect of the Obligations that is smaller in proportion to its Payment Share (as hereinafter defined) than such payments made by the other Borrowers are in proportion to the amounts of their respective Payment Shares, the Borrower making such proportionately smaller payment shall, when permitted by the preceding sentence, pay to the other Borrowers an amount such that the net payments made by the Borrower in respect of the Obligations shall be shared among the Borrowers pro rata in proportion to their respective Payment Shares. If any Borrower receives any payment that is greater in proportion to the amount of its Payment Shares than the payments received by the other Borrowers are in proportion to the amounts of their respective Payment Shares, the Borrower receiving such proportionately greater payment shall, when permitted by the second preceding sentence, pay to the other Borrowers an amount such that the payments received by the Borrowers shall be shared among the Borrowers pro rata in proportion to their respective Payment Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this paragraph or in this Agreement, no liability or obligation of any Borrower that shall accrue pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid nor shall it be deemed owed pursuant to this paragraph until all of the Obligations shall be finally paid in full in cash.    

77

For purposes hereof, the  Payment Share  of each Borrower shall be the sum of (a) the aggregate proceeds of the Obligations received by such Borrower plus (b) the product of (i) the aggregate Obligations remaining unpaid on the date such Obligations become due and payable in full, whether by stated maturity, acceleration, or otherwise (the  Determination Date ) reduced by the amount of such Obligations attributed to all or such Borrowers pursuant to clause (a) above, times (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is such Borrower s net worth on the effective date of this Agreement (determined as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal reporting period of such Borrower), and the denominator of which is the aggregate net worth of all Borrowers on such effective date.  
     
  (c)       It is the intent of each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that each Borrower s maximum Obligations shall be in, but not in excess of:  
     
  (i)       in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code on or within one year from the date on which any of the Obligations are incurred, the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the Obligations (or any other obligations of such Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Borrower under (A) Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or (B) any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in such case or proceeding by virtue of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code; or  
     
  (ii)       in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code subsequent to one year from the date on which any of the Obligations are incurred, the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the Obligations (or any other obligations of such Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Borrower under any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in any such case or proceeding by virtue of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code;   
     
  (iii)       in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Borrower under any law, statute or regulation other than the Bankruptcy Code (including, without limitation, any other bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, readjustment of debt, dissolution, liquidation or similar Debtor Relief Laws, including, but not limited to, a Bail-In Action), the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the Obligations (or any other obligations of such Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Borrower under such law, statute or regulation including, without limitation, any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in any such case or proceeding.  
     
  (d)       The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that they have requested that the Lenders make credit available to the Borrowers with each Borrower expecting to derive benefit, directly and indirectly, from the loans and other credit extended by the Lenders to the Borrowers.    

78

SECTION 9.15.    Consents to Renewals; Modifications and Other Actions and Events . This Agreement and all of the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder shall remain in full force and effect without regard to and shall not be released, affected or impaired by: (a ) any amendment, assignment, transfer, modification of or addition or supplement to the Obligations, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (b) any extension, indulgence, increase in the Obligations or other action or inaction in respect of any of the Loan Documents or otherwise with respect to the Obligations, or any acceptance of security for, or guaranties of, any of the Obligations or Loan Documents, or any surrender, release, exchange, impairment or alteration of any such security or guaranties including without limitation the failing to perfect a security interest in any such security or abstaining from taking advantage or of realizing upon any guaranties or upon any security interest in any such security; (c) any default by any Borrower under, or any lack of due execution, invalidity or unenforceability of, or any irregularity or other defect in, any of the Loan Documents; (d) any waiver by the Lenders or any other Person of any required performance or otherwise of any condition precedent or waiver of any requirement imposed by any of the Loan Documents, any guaranties or otherwise with respect to the Obligations; (e) any exercise or non-exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; (f) any sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of the assets of any Borrower or any consolidation or merger of any Borrower with or into any other Person, corporation, or entity, or any transfer or other disposition by any Borrower or any other holder of any Equity Interest of any Borrower; (g) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceedings involving or affecting any Borrower; (h) the release or discharge of any Borrower from the performance or observance of any agreement, covenant, term or condition under any of the Obligations or contained in any of the Loan Documents by operation of law; or (i) any other cause whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing which, in the absence of this provision, would release, affect or impair the obligations, covenants, agreements and duties of any Borrower hereunder, including without limitation any act or omission by the Administrative Agent, or any Lender or any other any Person which increases the scope of such Borrower s risk; and in each case described in this paragraph whether or not any Borrower shall have notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing, each of which is specifically waived by each Borrower. Each Borrower warrants to the Lenders that it has adequate means to obtain from each other Borrower on a continuing basis information concerning the financial condition and other matters with respect to the Borrowers and that it is not relying on the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to provide such information either now or in the future. 
     
  SECTION 9.16.    Waivers, Etc . Each Borrower unconditionally waives: (a) notice of any of the matters referred to in Section 9.15 above; (b) all notices which may be required by statute, rule or law or otherwise to preserve any rights of the Administrative Agent, or any Lender, including, without limitation, presentment to and demand of payment or performance from the other Borrowers and protect for non-payment or dishonor; (c) any right to the exercise by the Administrative Agent, or any Lender of any right, remedy, power or privilege in connection with any of the Loan Documents; (d) any requirement that the Administrative Agent, or any Lender, in the event of any default by any Borrower, first make demand upon or seek to enforce remedies against, such Borrower or any other Borrower before demanding payment under or seeking to enforce this Agreement against any other Borrower; (e) any right to notice of the disposition of any security which the Administrative Agent, or any Lender may hold from any Borrower or otherwise; and (f) all errors and omissions in connection with the Administrative Agent, or any Lender s administration of any of the Obligations, any of the Loan Documents, or any other act or omission of the Administrative Agent, or any Lender which changes the scope of the Borrower s risk, except as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, or any Lender. The obligations of each Borrower hereunder shall be complete and binding forthwith upon the execution of this Agreement and subject to no condition whatsoever, precedent or otherwise, and notice of acceptance hereof or action in reliance hereon shall not be required.    

79

SECTION 9.17.    Several Obligations; Nonreliance; Violation of Law . The respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and the failure of any Lender to make any Loan or perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. Each Lender hereby represents that it is not relying on or looking to any margin stock for the repayment of the Borrowings provided for herein. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no Issuing Bank nor any Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to any Borrower in violation of any Requirement of Law.  
     
  SECTION 9.18.    Disclosure . Each Borrower and each Lender hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and/or its Affiliates from time to time may hold investments in, make other loans to or have other relationships with any of the Borrowers, their respective Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates.  
     
  SECTION 9.19.    USA PATRIOT Act . Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the  Act ) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act.  
     
  SECTION 9.20.    Conversion of Currencies . (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.  
     
  (b)       The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the  Applicable Creditor ) shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the  Judgment Currency ) other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the  Agreement Currency ), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 9.20 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.  
     
  SECTION 9.21.    Amendment and Restatement  .   
     
  (a)       On the Effective Date the Existing Credit Agreement shall be amended, restated and superseded in its entirety hereby.

80

(b)       All indemnification obligations of the Borrowers arising under the Existing Credit Agreement (including any arising from a breach of the representations thereunder) shall survive this amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit Agreement.   
     
  (c)       The Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Lenders hereunder (which constitute  Required Banks  under the Existing Credit Agreement), hereby waives the requirement pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement that the Borrowers deliver prior notice of their election to terminate or reduce the  Commitments  under the Existing Credit Agreement. The execution of this Agreement by any Lender that is also a  Lender  under the Existing Credit Agreement shall constitute such Person s consent to the amendments to the Existing Credit Agreement contained herein.  
     
  (d)       By its execution hereof, each Lender hereby (i) consents to any amendments to be executed in connection herewith to the Loan Documents delivered in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement, all as in form and substance approved by the Administrative Agent, and (ii) authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into such amendments.

  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

  (i)     a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;  
     
  (ii)     a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or  
     
  (iii)     the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.

    Commitments    

Schedule 2.01   

SCHEDULE 2.05(b)(ii)    
     
  The unpaid principal balance of the Floorplan Swingline Loans will accrue interest at a variable rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Loans, and (ii) the LIBOR Rate applicable to the relevant Interest Period. Each change in the rate at which interest accrues will become effective without notice on the commencement of each Interest Period.  
     
  For the purposes of this Schedule 2.05(b)(ii), the following terms shall have the following meanings (capitalized terms not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement):  
     
    Business Day   means (i) with respect to any borrowing or payment of a Floorplan Swingline Loan or LIBOR Rate selection, a day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks generally are open in Vermont and/or New York for the conduct of substantially all of their commercial lending activities and on which dealings in United States dollars are carried on in the London interbank market and (ii) for all other purposes, a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which national banking associations are authorized to be closed.  
     
    LIBOR Rate   means with respect to any LIBOR advance for any Interest Period, the interest rate per annum determined by the Swingline Lender on the basis of the rate as set by the ICE Benchmark Administration (  ICE  ) (or the successor thereto if ICE is no longer making such rate available) for deposits in Dollars for a period equal to the applicable Interest Period which appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page (or any applicable successor page) to be the rate at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time, two Business Days prior to the commencement of the Interest Period for the offering by the Swingline Lender s London office, of dollar deposits in an amount comparable to such LIBOR advance with a maturity equal to such Interest Period. If no LIBOR Rate is available to the Swingline Lender, the applicable LIBOR Rate for the relevant Interest Period shall instead be the rate determined by the Swingline Lender to be the rate at which the Swingline Lender offers to place deposits in U.S. dollars with first-class banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period, in the approximate amount of the principal amount outstanding on such date and having a maturity equal to such Interest Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the LIBOR Rate be less than 0%.  
     
    Interest Period   means each consecutive calendar month commencing with the calendar month in which the initial Floorplan Swingline Loan was requested. Each Interest Period shall commence on the first day of each calendar month and if the initial Floorplan Swingline Loan was requested on a date other than the first day of a calendar month, the first Interest Period shall be determined as of the first day of the calendar month in which the initial Floorplan Swingline Loan was requested.  
     
  If any applicable domestic or foreign law, treaty, rule or regulation now or later in effect (whether or not it now applies to any Lender) or the interpretation or administration thereof by a governmental authority charged with such interpretation or administration, or compliance by any Lender with any guideline, request or directive of such an authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to maintain or fund the Floorplan Swingline Loans, then, upon notice to the Borrower by the Swingline Lender, the outstanding principal amount of Floorplan Swingline Loans, together with accrued interest and any other amounts payable to the Lenders under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be repaid (a) immediately upon the Swingline Lender s demand if such change or compliance with such requests, in the Swingline Lender s judgment, requires immediate repayment, or (b) at the expiration of the last Interest Period to expire before the effective date of any such change or request.  
     
  If the Swingline Lender determines that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of LIBOR Rate are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining the interest rate as provided in this Schedule 2.05(b)(ii), then the Swingline Lender shall forthwith give notice of such circumstances to the Borrower, whereupon (i) the obligation of the Swingline Lender to make Floorplan Swingline Loans shall be suspended until the Swingline Lender notifies the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to the suspension no longer exists, and (ii) the Borrowers shall repay in full the then outstanding principal amount of the Floorplan Swingline Loans, together with accrued interest, on the last day of the then current Interest Period.

   LOAN GUARANTY   
       
   THIS LOAN GUARANTY  (this  Guaranty ) is made as of the ____ day of _____, 20__, by ________________ (the  Guarantor ) in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, under the Credit Agreement referred to below.  
     
   WITNESSETH:   
       
   WHEREAS,  Spartan Motors, Inc., a Michigan corporation, Spartan Motors USA, Inc., a South Dakota corporation, Spartan Motors Global, Inc., a Michigan corporation and Utilimaster Services, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company (each, individually, a  Borrower  and, collectively, the  Borrowers ) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a national banking association, as Administrative Agent (the  Administrative Agent ), and certain other Lenders from time to time party thereto have entered into a certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of October 31, 2016 (as same may be amended or modified from time to time, the  Credit Agreement ), providing, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, for extensions of credit to be made by the Lenders to the Borrowers;  
     
   WHEREAS,  it is a condition precedent to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders executing the Credit Agreement that the Guarantor executes and delivers this Guaranty whereby the Guarantor shall guarantee the payment when due, subject to Section 9 hereof, of all Guaranteed Obligations (as defined below); and  
     
   WHEREAS,  in consideration of the financial and other support that the Borrowers have provided, and such financial and other support as the Borrowers may in the future provide, to the Guarantor, and in order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into the Credit Agreement, and the Lenders and their Affiliates to enter into one or more agreements relating to Swap Agreement Obligations and Banking Services Obligations with the Borrowers and/or the Guarantor, and because the Guarantor has determined that executing this Guaranty is in its interest and to its financial benefit, the Guarantor is willing to guarantee the obligations of each of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to guarantee the other Guaranteed Obligations;  
     
   NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:  
     
  SECTION 1.1.      Terms in Credit Agreement . All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Credit Agreement.  
     
  SECTION 2.1.      Representations and Warranties . The Guarantor represents and warrants (which representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been renewed upon the date of each Borrowing under the Credit Agreement) that:  
     
  (a)     It is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and, except where the failure to do so would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.    

Exhibit B 

(b)     It has the power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver this Guaranty and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery by it of this Guaranty and the performance of its obligations hereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings, and this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except as enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.  
     
  (c)     Neither the execution and delivery by it of this Guaranty, nor the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions hereof will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on it or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) its articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating or other management agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Guarantor or a subsidiary thereof pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by it or any of its subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by it or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Guaranty or the performance by it of its obligations hereunder or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Guaranty.  
     
  SECTION 2.2.  Covenants . The Guarantor covenants that, so long as any Lender has any Commitment outstanding under the Credit Agreement, any transaction relating to any Swap Agreement Obligations or Banking Services Obligations remains in effect or any of the other Obligations shall remain unpaid, that it will fully comply with those covenants and agreements set forth in the Credit Agreement which are applicable to the Guarantor and, if it is necessary and the Guarantor is able to do so, the Guarantor will enable each Borrower and each Subsidiary of each Borrower (each, a  Debtor  and collectively, the  Debtors ) to fully comply with such covenants and agreements.  
     
  SECTION 3.  The Guaranty . Subject to Section 9 hereof, the Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor and not as surety, the full and punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or early termination or otherwise, and at all times thereafter) and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, including without limitation any such Guaranteed Obligations incurred or accrued during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding, whether or not allowed or allowable in such proceeding. Upon failure by any Debtor to pay punctually any Guaranteed Obligation, the Guarantor agrees that it shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and, if applicable, their Affiliates, the Guaranteed Obligation not so paid at the place and in the manner specified in the Credit Agreement, the relevant Loan Document or the relevant agreement relating to any Swap Agreement Obligations or Banking Services Obligations, as the case may be. This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. The Guarantor waives any right to require the Lender to sue any Debtor, any other guarantor, or any other person obligated for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or otherwise to enforce its payment against any collateral securing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.  

Exhibit B  

As used in this Guaranty:  
     
    Guaranteed Obligations   means:   
     
  (i)     All Obligations;   
     
  (ii)     Any and all obligations of any Debtor, whether absolute or contingent and howsoever and whensoever created, arising, evidenced or acquired (including all renewals, extensions and modifications thereof and substitutions therefor), under (a) any and all Swap Agreements permitted under the Credit Agreement (to the extent the provider of such Swap Agreement is a Lender or was a Lender (or an Affiliate of any such Lender) at the time such Swap Agreement is entered into), and (b) any and all cancellations, buy backs, reversals, terminations or assignments of any Swap Agreement transaction (collectively, the  Swap Agreement Obligations  and  
     
  (iii)     Any and all obligations of any Debtor, whether absolute or contingent and howsoever and whensoever created, arising, evidenced or acquired (including all renewals, extensions and modifications thereof and substitutions therefor) in connection with the following bank services (collectively, the  Bank Services ) provided to any Debtor by any Lender or any of its Affiliates: (a) commercial credit cards, (b) stored value cards and (c) treasury management services (including, without limitation, controlled disbursement, automated clearinghouse transactions, return items, overdrafts and interstate depository network services) (collectively, the  Banking Services Obligations ).  
     
  SECTION 4.  Guaranty Unconditional . Subject to Section 9 hereof, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by:  
     
  (i)     any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation of law or otherwise, or any obligation of any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations;

  (vii)     any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any Debtor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder.  
     
  SECTION 5.  Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full: Reinstatement In Certain Circumstances . The Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full, the Commitments under the Credit Agreement shall have terminated or expired and all agreements relating to any Swap Agreement Obligations or Banking Services Obligations have terminated or expired.

  SECTION 6.  Waivers . The Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against any Debtor, any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other Person.  
     
  SECTION 7.  Subrogation . The Guarantor hereby agrees not to assert any right, claim or cause of action, including, without limitation, a claim for subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or otherwise, against any Debtor arising out of or by reason of this Guaranty or the obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the payment or securing or purchasing of any of the Guaranteed Obligations by the Guarantor unless and until the Guaranteed Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full, any commitment to lend under the Credit Agreement and any other Loan Documents is terminated and all agreements relating to any Swap Agreement Obligations or Banking Services Obligations have terminated or expired.  
     
  SECTION 8.  Stay of Acceleration . If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Debtor, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement relating to any Swap Agreement Obligations or Banking Services Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent made at the request of the Required Lenders.    

Exhibit B  

SECTION 9.  Limitation on Obligations . (a) The provisions of this Guaranty are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of the Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any Lender, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding (such highest amount determined hereunder being the relevant Guarantor's  Maximum Liability ). This Section 9(a) with respect to the Maximum Liability of the Guarantor is intended solely to preserve the rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder to the maximum extent not subject to avoidance under Applicable Law, and neither the Guarantor nor any other person or entity shall have any right or claim under this Section 9(a) with respect to the Maximum Liability, except to the extent necessary so that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be rendered voidable under Applicable Law.  
     
  (b)       The Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Liability of the Guarantor, and may exceed the aggregate Maximum Liability of all other guarantors, without impairing this Guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent hereunder. Nothing in this Section 9(b) shall be construed to increase the Guarantor's obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability.  
     
  (c)       In the event the Guarantor or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations (a  Paying Guarantor ) shall make any payment or payments under this Guaranty or any other guaranty executed in connection with the Credit Agreement or shall suffer any loss as a result of any realization upon any collateral granted by it to secure its obligations under this Guaranty, each other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations (each a  Non-Paying Guarantor ) shall contribute to such Paying Guarantor an amount equal to such Non-Paying Guarantor's  Pro Rata Share  of such payment or payments made, or losses suffered, by such Paying Guarantor. For the purposes hereof, each Non-Paying Guarantor's  Pro Rata Share  with respect to any such payment or loss by a Paying Guarantor shall be determined as of the date on which such payment or loss was made by reference to the ratio of (i) such Non-Paying Guarantor's Maximum Liability as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder) or, if such Non-Paying Guarantor's Maximum Liability has not been determined, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Non-Paying Guarantor from the Debtors after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means) to (ii) the aggregate Maximum Liability of all guarantors (including such Paying Guarantor) as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder), or to the extent that a Maximum Liability has not been determined for the guarantors, the aggregate amount of all monies received by the guarantors from the Debtors after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means). Nothing in this Section 9(c) shall affect the Guarantor's several liability for the entire amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (up to the Guarantor's Maximum Liability). The Guarantor covenants and agrees that its right to receive any contribution under this Guaranty from a Non-Paying Guarantor shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to all the Guaranteed Obligations. The provisions of this Section 9(c) are for the benefit of both the Administrative Agent and the Guarantor and may be enforced by any one, or more, or all of them in accordance with the terms hereof.  
     
  SECTION 10.  Application of Payments . All payments received by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, on a pro rata basis, unless a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise direct.    

Exhibit B  

SECTION 11.  Notices . All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be given or made by telecopier or other writing and telecopied, or mailed or delivered to the intended recipient at its address or telecopier number set forth on the signature pages hereof or such other address or telecopy number as such party may hereafter specify for such purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this Guaranty, all such communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when transmitted by telecopier, or personally delivered or, in the case of a mailed notice sent by certified mail return-receipt requested, on the date set forth on the receipt (provided, that any refusal to accept any such notice shall be deemed to be notice thereof as of the time of any such refusal), in each case given or addressed as aforesaid.  
     
  SECTION 12.  No Waivers . No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lenders in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in this Guaranty, the other Loan Documents and any agreements relating to the other Guaranteed Obligations shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.  
     
  SECTION 13.  No Duty to Advise . The Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Debtor's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that the Guarantor assumes and incurs under this Guaranty, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any duty to advise the Guarantor of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks.  
     
  SECTION 14.  Successors and Assigns . This Guaranty is for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and permitted assigns and in the event of an assignment of any amounts payable under the Credit Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or any agreements relating to the other Guaranteed Obligations, the rights hereunder, to the extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, shall be transferred with such indebtedness. This Guaranty shall be binding upon the Guarantor and its successors and permitted assigns.  
     
  SECTION 15.  Changes in Writing . Neither this Guaranty nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only in writing signed by the Guarantor and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders.  
     
  SECTION 16.  Costs of Enforcement . The Guarantor agrees to pay all costs and expenses including, without limitation, all court costs and attorney s fees and expenses paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender in endeavoring to collect all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations from, or in prosecuting any action against, any Debtor, the Guarantor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.  
     
  SECTION 17.  GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL . THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAWS RULES). THE GUARANTOR HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT IN MICHIGAN AND FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE GUARANTOR IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH ANY OF THEM MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. THE GUARANTOR, AND THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS ACCEPTING THIS GUARANTY, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.    

Exhibit B  

SECTION 18.  Taxes,     e  tc . All payments required to be made by the Guarantor hereunder shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties or other charges of whatsoever nature imposed by any government or any political or taxing authority thereof (but excluding Excluded Taxes), provided, however, that if the Guarantor is required by law to make such deduction or withholding, the Guarantor shall forthwith (i) pay to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, such additional amount as results in the net amount received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, equaling the full amount which would have been received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, had no such deduction or withholding been made, (ii) pay the full amount deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with Applicable Law, and (iii) furnish to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, certified copies of official receipts evidencing payment of such withholding taxes within 30 days after such payment is made.  
     
  SECTION 19.  Setoff . Without limiting the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under Applicable Law, if all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations is then due, whether pursuant to the occurrence of a Default or otherwise, then the Guarantor authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to apply any sums standing to the credit of the Guarantor with the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any Affiliate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender toward the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.  
     
  SECTION 20.  Foreign Currency . The specification of payment in a specific currency at a specific place and time pursuant to the documentation relating to the Guaranteed Obligations is essential. That currency or those currencies are also the currency of account and payment under this Guaranty. If any Guarantor is unable for any reason to effect payment of a specific currency (other than Dollars) as required by the preceding sentence or if any Guarantor defaults in the payment when due of any amount of a specific currency (other than Dollars) under this Guaranty, the Lenders may, at the option of the Administrative Agent, require such payment to be made to the office of the Administrative Agent in London, England (or such other office as the Administrative Agent may direct in a notice to the Guarantors) in the equivalent amount in Dollars at the Exchange Rate. In the event that any payment, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, does not result in payment of the amount of currency due under this Guaranty, upon conversion to the currency of account and transfer to the place specified for payment, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders have an independent cause of action against the Guarantors for the deficiency.    

Exhibit B  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to be duly executed, under seal, by its authorized officer as of the day and year first above written.
