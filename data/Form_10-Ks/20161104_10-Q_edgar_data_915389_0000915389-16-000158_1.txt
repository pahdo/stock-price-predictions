FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are all statements, other than statements of historical fact, that may be made by Eastman Chemical Company (the "Company" or "Eastman") from time to time. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "plans," "projects," "will," "would," and similar expressions or expressions of the negative of these terms. Forward-looking statements may relate to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters; pending and future legal proceedings; exposure to, and effects of hedging of, raw material and energy costs or disruption of raw material or energy supply, foreign currencies and interest rates; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions; competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost, margin and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial results, events, and conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual assets and products, businesses, and segments, as well as for the whole of Eastman; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans and activities; pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated and other future restructuring, acquisition, divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts and targets; the timing and costs of, and benefits from, the integration of, and expected business and financial performance of, acquired businesses; strategic initiatives and development, production, commercialization and acceptance of new products, services and technologies and related costs; asset, business, and product portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and net interest costs. 
    
  Forward-looking statements are based upon certain underlying assumptions as of the date such statements were made. Such assumptions are based upon internal estimates and other analyses of current market conditions and trends, management expectations, plans, and strategies, economic conditions, and other factors. Forward-looking statements and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. The most significant known factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are identified and discussed under "Risk Factors" in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report.  
    
  The Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made. Except as may be required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or alter these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
       
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Eastman Chemical Company (the "Company" or "Eastman") in accordance and consistent with the accounting policies stated in the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. The   December 31, 2015   financial position data included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and of necessity include some amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. Future actual results could differ from such current estimates. The unaudited consolidated financial statements include assets, liabilities, sales revenue, and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained. Eastman accounts for other joint ventures and investments where it exercises significant influence on the equity basis. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period data has been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to conform to current period presentation. Third quarter 2016 includes a   $47 million   correction of prior periods' cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment related to the Solutia, Inc. ("Solutia") and Taminco Corporation ("Taminco") acquisitions. See   Note 3, "Goodwill"   and   Note 13, "Stockholders' Equity"  . 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance for debt issuance costs as a part of the simplification initiative. Under this guidance, debt issuance costs will be presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. The amortization of debt issuance costs will be reported as interest expense. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected by the amendment. As of March 31, 2016, the new guidance was applied on a retrospective basis which resulted in a reclassification of   $31 million   from "Other noncurrent assets" to "Long-term borrowings" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at   December 31, 2015  . See   Note 7, "Borrowings"  . 
    
  In January 2016, Eastman changed its organizational and management structure following completion of the integration of recently acquired businesses to better align similar strategies and business models. As a result, beginning first quarter 2016, the Company's products and operations are managed and reported in   four   operating segments: Additives   Functional Products ("AFP"), Advanced Materials ("AM"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. For further information, see   Note 3, "Goodwill"   and   Note 18,   "  Segment Information  ". 
    
  Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 
    
  The Company has rights and obligations under non-recourse factoring facilities that have a combined limit of    158 million     (  $177 million  ) as of   September 30, 2016   and are committed until December 2017. These arrangements include receivables in the United States, Belgium, Germany, and Finland, and are subject to various eligibility requirements. The Company sells the receivables at face value but receives funding (approximately   85 percent  ) net of a deposit amount until collections are received from customers for the receivables sold. The total amounts of cumulative receivables sold in   third quarter   and   first nine months 2016   were approximately   $220 million   and   $680 million  , respectively. The total amounts of cumulative receivables sold in   third quarter   and   first nine months 2015   were approximately   $245 million   and   $780 million  , respectively. As part of the program, the Company continues to service the sold receivables at market rates with no servicing assets or liabilities recognized. The amounts of sold receivables outstanding under the non-recourse factoring facilities were   $105 million   and   $106 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of the receivables sold equals the carrying value at the time of the sale, and no gain or loss is recognized. The Company is exposed to a credit loss of up to   10 percent   on sold receivables.

    INVENTORIES 

Inventories valued on the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method were approximately   60 percent   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

In January 2016, as a result of the changes in Eastman's organizational and management structure, goodwill was reassigned to segments using a relative fair value allocation. In conjunction with the organizational changes and in accordance with GAAP, during first quarter 2016 Eastman performed an impairment assessment and concluded that no indication of an impairment existed. For further information on the organizational changes, see   Note 1, "Basis of Presentation"   and   Note 18,   "  Segment Information  ". 
    
  Changes to the carrying value of goodwill follow: 

(1)   
    See   Note 1, "Basis of Presentation"   regarding correction of prior period foreign currency translation. 
       
  As of September 30, 2016, the reported balance of goodwill included accumulated impairment losses of   $23 million  ,   $12 million  , and   $14 million   in the AFP segment, CI segment, and other segments, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the reported balance of goodwill included accumulated impairment losses of   $35 million   and   $14 million   in the Adhesives   Plasticizers segment and other segments, respectively. 

4. 
    EQUITY INVESTMENTS 
       
  In June 2016, Eastman sold its   50 percent   interest in Primester, a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at the Company's Kingsport site, to an affiliate of the joint venture partner for   $35 million  . This investment was accounted for under the equity method. Eastman's net investment in the joint venture at the date of sale was   $18 million  . Such amounts were included in "Other noncurrent assets" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and the gain of   $17 million   was recorded in "  Other charges (income), net  " in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings.

    PAYABLES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES 

"Other" consists primarily of accruals for interest payable, dividends payable, the current portion of environmental liabilities, and miscellaneous accruals. 

6. 
    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 

The third quarter and first nine months 2016 effective tax rates reflect a benefit from the extension of favorable U.S. federal tax provisions, primarily research and development ("R D") tax credits and deferral of certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries from U.S. income taxes in fourth quarter of 2015. The favorable tax provisions will benefit all quarters in 2016, compared to only fourth quarter in 2015. The third quarter and first nine months 2016 effective tax rates include a tax benefit of   $16 million   related to foreign tax credits as a result of the amendment of prior year income tax returns. The first nine months 2016 effective tax rate includes a   $16 million   one-time benefit for the restoration of tax basis for which depreciation deductions were previously limited and a   $9 million   tax benefit primarily due to adjustments to the tax provision to reflect the finalization of 2014 foreign income tax returns. The first nine months 2015 effective tax rate included a   $6 million   benefit from the settlement of non-U.S. income tax audits offset by an unfavorable foreign rate variance due to increased earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions.

    BORROWINGS 

On May 26, 2016, the Company sold euro-denominated 1.50% notes due 2023 in the principal amount of    550 million   (  $614 million  ). Proceeds from the sale of the notes, net of transaction costs, were    544 million   (  $607 million  ) and were used for the early repayment of   $500 million   of   2.4% notes due June 2017   and repayment of other borrowings. Total consideration for the partial redemption of   2.4% notes due June 2017   was   $507 million   (  $500 million   for the principal amount and   $7 million   for the early redemption premium) and are reported as financing activities on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The early repayment resulted in a charge of   $9 million   for early debt extinguishment costs primarily attributable to the early redemption premium and related unamortized costs. The book value of the redeemed debt was   $498 million  . In conjunction with the euro-denominated public debt offering, the Company contemporaneously designated these borrowings as a non-derivative hedge of a portion of its net investment in one of its euro functional currency denominated subsidiaries. For further information, see   Note 8, "Derivative and Non-Derivative Financial Instruments"  . 
    
  Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Borrowings 
    
  In connection with the 2014 acquisition of Taminco Corporation ("Taminco"), Eastman borrowed   $1.0 billion   under a five-year Term Loan. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Term Loan balance outstanding was   $250 million   with an interest rate of   1.77 percent  . In second quarter   2016  ,   $100 million   of the Company's borrowings under the Term Loan were repaid using available cash. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Term Loan balance outstanding was   $350 million   with an interest rate of   1.67 percent  . Borrowings under the Term Loan are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates.  
    
  The Company has access to a   $1.25 billion   revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") that expires October 2021. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Commercial paper borrowings are classified as short-term. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's commercial paper borrowings were   $175 million   with a weighted average interest rate of   0.76 percent  . At December 31, 2015, the Company's commercial paper borrowings were   $430 million   with a weighted average interest rate of   0.80 percent  .

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Company has access to a $  250 million   accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "A/R Facility") that expires April 2019. Eastman Chemical Financial Corporation ("ECFC"), a subsidiary of the Company, has an agreement to sell interests in trade receivables under the A/R Facility to a third party purchaser. Third party creditors of ECFC have first priority claims on the assets of ECFC before those assets would be available to satisfy the Company's general obligations. Borrowings under the A/R Facility are subject to interest rates based on a spread over the lender's borrowing costs, and ECFC pays a fee to maintain availability of the A/R Facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's borrowings under the A/R Facility were   $50 million   supported by trade receivables with an interest rate of   1.58 percent  . In   third quarter     2016  ,   $150 million   of the available amount under the A/R Facility was repaid. In   first nine months 2016  ,   $350 million   of the available amount under the A/R Facility was repaid and   $200 million   borrowed. At December 31, 2015, the Company's borrowings under the A/R Facility were   $200 million   supported by trade receivables with an interest rate of   1.11 percent  .  
    
  The Credit and A/R Facilities and the Term Loan contain a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. Total available borrowings under the Credit and A/R Facilities were   $1,275 million   and   $842 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. Changes in available borrowings were due primarily to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under the A/R Facility. The Company would not have violated applicable covenants for these periods if the total available amounts of the facilities had been borrowed. 
    
  Fair Value of Borrowings 
    
  The Company has classified its long-term borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , under the fair value hierarchy as defined in the accounting policies in   Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies",   to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. The fair value for fixed-rate debt securities is based on current market prices and is classified as Level 1. The fair value for the Company's other borrowings, which relate to the Term Loan, the A/R Facility, and capital leases, equals the carrying value and is classified as Level 2.

    DERIVATIVE AND NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
       
  Hedging Programs 
    
  The Company is exposed to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. To mitigate these market risks and their effects on the cash flows of the underlying transactions and investments in foreign subsidiaries, the Company uses various derivative and non-derivative instruments when appropriate in accordance with the Company's hedging strategy and policies. Designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.   
    
  For further information on hedging programs, see   Note 10, "Derivatives",   to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
    
  Fair Value Hedges 
    
  Fair value hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk. All derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. In second quarter 2016, the Company entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a portion of the 3.8% notes due March 2025 in order to manage the Company's interest rate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , the total notional amount of the Company's interest rate swap was   $75 million  . As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   outstanding interest rate swap hedges that were designated as fair value hedges. There was no hedge ineffectiveness associated with the fair value hedges during   third quarter   and   first nine months     2016   and   2015  .

Cash Flow Hedges 
    
  Cash flow hedges are derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk. All derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of "Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax" ("OCI") located in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings and reclassified into earnings as part of "Cost of sales" in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivatives representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

Ineffective portions of raw material and energy hedges are immediately recognized in earnings within "Cost of sales" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. The Company recognized pre-tax losses for ineffectiveness of the commodity hedging portfolio of   $1 million   during both   third quarter   2016 and 2015 and recognized   $3 million   in pre-tax losses during   first nine months     2016  . There was   no   hedge ineffectiveness associated with the interest rate and foreign exchange cash flow hedges during   third quarter   and   first nine months     2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Net Investment Hedges 
    
  Net investment hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the net investment hedge is reported as a component of "Change in cumulative translation adjustment" ("CTA") within OCI located in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. Gains and losses representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings. 
    
  Contemporaneously with its sale on May 26, 2016 of euro-denominated 1.50% notes due 2023 in the principal amount of    550 million   (  $614 million  ), the Company designated these borrowings as a non-derivative hedge of a portion of its net investment in one of its euro functional currency denominated subsidiaries to protect the designated net investment against foreign currency fluctuations. As of September 30, 2016, the total notional value of the non-derivative net investment hedge was    543 million   (  $607 million  ). The designated foreign currency-denominated borrowings are included as part of "Long-term borrowings'" within the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The following table summarizes the change in the unrealized loss on the net investment hedge instruments recognized as part of the CTA within OCI during   third quarter   and   first nine months     2016   and   2015  . There were no reclassifications to earnings or hedge ineffectiveness with these instruments during   third quarter   and   first nine months     2016   and   2015  . 

Hedging Summary 
    
  Monetized positions and mark-to-market gains and losses from raw materials and energy, currency, and certain interest rate hedges that were included in accumulated OCI before taxes totaled losses of   $267 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $386 million   at   September 30, 2015  . If realized,   $61 million   net losses as of   September 30, 2016   will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months.  
    
  The gains or losses on nonqualifying derivatives or derivatives that are not designated as hedges are marked to market and reported in "  Other charges (income), net  " in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings, and, in all periods presented, represent foreign exchange derivatives denominated in multiple currencies and are transacted and settled in the same quarter. The Company recognized net losses on nonqualifying derivatives of   $11 million   during   third quarter     2015   and net losses of   $14 million   and   $23 million   during the   first nine months   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  For additional information on fair value measurement, see   Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies",   to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  The following chart shows the gross financial assets and liabilities valued on a recurring basis. During the periods presented, there were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels.

                      Table of Contents  

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities are currently classified as Level 2. Level 2 fair value is based on estimates using standard pricing models. These standard pricing models use inputs which are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. The fair value of commodity contracts is derived using forward curves supplied by an industry recognized and unrelated third party. In addition, on an ongoing basis, the Company tests a subset of its valuations against valuations received from the transaction's counterparty to validate the accuracy of its standard pricing models. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the Company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance. 
    
  All of the Company's derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, which provide for the option to settle contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day and in the same currency. In addition, these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event. Management has elected to present the derivative contracts on a gross basis in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Had it chosen to present the derivatives contracts on a net basis, it would have a derivative in a net asset position of   $85 million   and a derivative in a net liability position of   $294 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company does not have any cash collateral due under such agreements.

    RETIREMENT PLANS 
       
  Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
    
  Eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. In addition, Eastman provides a subsidy for life insurance, health care, and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to January 1, 2007, and a subsidy for health care and dental benefits to retirees' eligible survivors. Costs recognized for these benefits are recorded using estimated amounts, which may change as actual costs derived for the year are determined. 
    
  For additional information regarding retirement plans, see   Note 11, "Retirement Plans",   to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost were as follows:   

(1)   
    In third quarter 2016, a change to a UK pension plan triggered an interim remeasurement of the plan obligation and resulted in a $30 million mark-to-market loss and in 2015 the closure of the Workington, UK acetate tow manufacturing site triggered an interim remeasurement of a UK pension plan obligation both included in Other in   Note 18, "Segment Information"  .  
               (2)   
    Gain   in the Fibers segment due to the closure of the Workington, UK acetate tow manufacturing site. 
       
  The Company contributed   $50 million   and   $90 million   to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in   first nine months     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  In third quarter 2016, the Company announced a change to a UK defined benefit pension plan which triggered an interim remeasurement of the plan obligation resulting in a mark-to-market ("MTM") loss of   $30 million  . The MTM loss was primarily due to a lower discount rate at the third quarter 2016 remeasurement date compared to December 31, 2015. The lower discount rate is reflective of changes in global market conditions and interest rates on high-grade corporate bonds. 
  In first quarter   2016  , the Company changed the approach used to calculate service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Company elected to calculate service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation or the annual net periodic benefit cost or credit of the plans because the change in the service and interest costs will be offset in the MTM actuarial gain or loss which typically is recognized in the fourth quarter of each year or in any other quarters in which an interim remeasurement is triggered.

Purchase Obligations and Lease Commitments 
    
  The Company had various purchase obligations at   September 30, 2016  , totaling   $1.5 billion   over a period of approximately   30 years   for materials, supplies, and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month-to-month operating leases totaling   $259 million   over a period of approximately   40 years  . Of the total lease commitments, approximately   50 percent   relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; approximately   40 percent   relate to railcars; and approximately   10 percent   relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment.  
    
  Guarantees 
    
  The Company has operating leases with terms that require the Company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease as well as other guarantees. Disclosures about each group of similar guarantees are provided below. 
    
  Residual Value Guarantees 
    
  The Company has operating leases with terms that require the Company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease. These residual value guarantees totaled   $125 million   at   September 30, 2016   and consist primarily of leases for railcars and the company aircraft mostly expiring in 2016 and 2017. Residual guarantee payments that become probable and estimable are accrued to rent expense over the remaining life of the applicable lease. Management's current expectation is that the likelihood of material residual guarantee payments is remote. 
    
  Other Guarantees 
    
  Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, and other parties when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur. Non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company. The Company's current other guarantees include guarantees relating primarily to intellectual property, environmental matters, and other indemnifications and have arisen through the normal course of business. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims, if they were to occur. These other guarantees have terms up to   30 years   with maximum potential future payments of approximately   $35 million   in the aggregate, with none of these guarantees being individually significant to the Company's operating results, financial position, or liquidity. Management's current expectation is that future payment or performance related to non-performance under other guarantees is remote.

    ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
       
  Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and post-closure under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastman's policies described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   The Company's total reserve for environmental contingencies was   $325 million   and   $336 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , this reserve included   $8 million   related to sites previously closed and impaired by Eastman and sites that have been divested by Eastman but for which the Company retains the environmental liability related to these sites.  
    
  The Company's total environmental reserve that management believes to be probable and estimable for environmental contingencies, including remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, is included as part of "Payables and other current liabilities" and "Other long-term liabilities" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as follows:      

Remediation 
    
  Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs ranged from the minimum or best estimate of   $300 million   to the maximum of   $510 million   and from the minimum or best estimate of   $308 million   to the maximum of   $516 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The maximum estimated future costs are considered to be reasonably possible and include the amounts accrued at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   Although the resolution of uncertainties related to these environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, because of the availability of legal defenses, the Company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's consolidated financial position or cash flows.    
    
  Reserves for environmental remediation include liabilities expected to be paid within   approximately 30 years  .   The amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are included within "Cost of sales" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. Changes in the reserves for environmental remediation liabilities during first nine months 2016 are summarized below:

Closure/Post-Closure 
    
  An asset retirement obligation is an obligation for the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. The Company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful life. Environmental asset retirement obligations consist primarily of closure and post-closure costs. For sites that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate accrued to date over the sites' estimated useful lives for these environmental asset retirement obligation costs was     $25 million   and   $28 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Other 
    
  The Company also has contractual asset retirement obligations not associated with environmental liabilities. Eastman's non-environmental asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the future closure of leased manufacturing assets at Pace, Florida and Oulu, Finland. These accrued non-environmental asset retirement obligations were     $46 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  

From time to time, the Company and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

    EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS PER SHARE 
       
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS"):   

In   third quarter   and   first nine months     2016  , options to purchase   1,437,767   and   1,076,143   shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the shares treated as outstanding for computation of diluted earnings per share because the total market value of option exercises for these awards was less than the total cash proceeds that would be received for these exercises.   Third quarter   and   first nine months     2016   reflect the impact of share repurchases of   1,128,869   and   1,760,940  , respectively.  
    
  In   third quarter   and   first nine months     2015  , options to purchase   773,643   and   264,043   shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the shares treated as outstanding for computation of diluted earnings per share because the total market value of option exercises for these awards was less than the total cash proceeds that would be received for these exercises.   Third quarter   and   first nine months     2015   reflect the impact of share repurchases of   221,578   and   656,578  , respectively.  
    
  The Company declared cash dividends of   $0.46   and   $0.40   per share in   third quarter     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1.38   and   $1.20   per share in first nine months   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

As a result of the annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, in third quarter and first nine months 2015 the Company recognized intangible asset impairments of   $18 million   in the AM segment primarily to reduce the carrying value of the V-Kool        window films products trade name to the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value was determined using an income approach, specifically, the relief from royalty method. The impairment resulted from a decrease in projected revenues since the tradename was acquired from Solutia in 2012. The decrease in projected revenues was primarily due to the Asian economic downturn impacting car sales growth in those geographic markets. 
    
  In first nine months 2015, net asset impairments and restructuring charges included   $81 million   of fixed asset impairments and   $14 million   of restructuring charges, including severance, in the Fibers segment due to the closure of the Workington, UK acetate tow manufacturing site which was substantially completed in 2015. Additionally, in   first nine months   2015, management decided not to continue a growth initiative that was reported in "Other". This resulted in the Company recognizing fixed asset and goodwill impairments of   $8 million   and restructuring charges of   $4 million  . Additionally, during first nine months 2015, net asset impairments and restructuring charges included   $4 million   of restructuring charges primarily for severance associated with the integration of Taminco. 
    
  Changes in Reserves for Asset Impairments, Restructuring Charges, Net, and Severance Charges 
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, the non-cash reductions attributable to asset impairments, and the cash reductions in restructuring reserves for severance costs and site closure costs paid in   first nine months     2016   and full year   2015  : 

Severance payments in first nine months 2016 relate primarily to fourth quarter 2015 actions taken to reduce non-operations workforce. Substantially all severance costs remaining are expected to be applied to the reserves within one year.

    SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS 
       
  The Company utilizes share-based awards under employee and non-employee director compensation programs. These share-based awards may include restricted and unrestricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, and performance shares. In   third quarter     2016   and   2015  ,   $7 million   and   $9 million  , respectively, of compensation expense before tax were recognized in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings for all share-based awards. The impact on both   third quarter     2016   and   2015   net earnings of   $5 million   is net of deferred tax expense related to share-based award compensation for each period. 
    
  In   first nine months     2016   and   2015  ,   $27 million   and   $30 million  , respectively, of compensation expense before tax were recognized in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings for all share-based awards. The impact on   first nine months     2016   and   2015   net earnings of   $17 million   and   $18 million  , respectively, is net of deferred tax expense related to share-based award compensation for each period. 
    
  For additional information regarding share-based compensation plans and awards, see   Note 18, "Share-Based Compensation Plans and Awards",   to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    SEGMENT INFORMATION 
       
  As reported in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company's products and operations were managed and reported in five operating segments: Additives   Functional Products ("AFP"), Adhesives   Plasticizers ("A P"), Advanced Materials ("AM"), Fibers, and Specialty Fluids   Intermediates ("SFI"). Beginning first quarter 2016, as a result of changes in the Company's organizational structure and management, the Company's products and operations are managed and reported in   four   operating segments: AFP, AM, Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. The new structure supports the Company's strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio by better aligning similar businesses in a more streamlined structure. 
    
  Under the new structure, the adhesives resins product line of the former A P segment is moved to the AFP segment, the specialty fluids product line of the former SFI segment is moved to the AFP segment, and the plasticizers product line of the former A P segment is moved to the new CI segment. In addition to the product line changes, there were shifts in products among product lines in different segments. Acetyl and olefin products with animal nutrition and food ingredient applications of the former SFI segment are moved to the AFP segment as part of the care chemicals and animal nutrition product lines. Distribution solvents, ethylene oxide derivatives, and ethyl acetate products are moved from the AFP segment to the new CI segment in the other intermediates product line.

    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
       
  In May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued new principles-based accounting guidance for revenue recognition that will supersede virtually all existing revenue guidance. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve the core principle, the guidance establishes the following five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligation in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The guidance also details the accounting treatment for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. Lastly, disclosure requirements have been enhanced to provide sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The deferral results in the new revenue standard being effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted under the original effective date of fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. In April 2016, the FASB issued clarifying guidance to the 2014 revenue standard in regards to the identification of performance obligations and licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients to the new revenue standard that includes clarification of the collectability criterion, specification for the measurement of noncash considerations, clarifies a completed contract for transition purposes and clarification in regards to the retrospective application, as well as, policy elections, and practical expedients. The effective date for both amendments is the same as that of the revenue standard stated above. Management is currently evaluating the impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations and related disclosures.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In January 2016, the FASB issued targeted improvements in regards to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The changes are as follows: requires equity investments (except equity method and consolidated investments) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment, when a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value; eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; and requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted but limited. The new guidance is to be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and for equity securities without readily determinable fair values, applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. Management has concluded that changes in its accounting required by this new guidance will not materially impact the Company's financial position or results of operations and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on lease accounting. The new guidance establishes two types of leases for lessees: finance or operating. The guidance for lessors is largely unchanged. Under the guidance, a lessee is to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability that arises from a lease. A lessee can make a policy election, by asset class, to not recognize lease assets or liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Both finance and operating leases will have associated right-of-use assets and liabilities initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. Current and noncurrent balance sheet classification will apply. Finance leases will have another reported element for interest associated with the principal lease liability. The component concept from the 2014 revenue recognition standard has been included in the new lease standard which will guide identification of individual assets and non-lease components. As with current GAAP, the guidance does not apply to the following leases: intangible assets to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas, and similar nonregenerative resources, biological assets (includes timber), inventory, or assets under construction. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance is to be applied under a modified retrospective approach wherein practical expedients have been allowed that will not require reassessment of current leases at the effective date. Management is currently evaluating the impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance for derivatives and hedging given lack of specific guidance and diversity in practice. The guidance clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedge accounting relationship provided all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met (specifically points to counterparty credit worthiness). This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new guidance is to be applied under the prospective method or modified retrospective approach. Management has concluded that changes in its accounting required by this new guidance will not materially impact the Company's financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance for stock compensation as a part of the simplification initiative that covers related tax accounting, cash flow presentation, and forfeitures. The two tax accounting related amendments are as follows: all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be recognized within income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, the tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur, an entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period; and the threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. The cash flow presentation items sets forth that excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity and cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. For forfeitures, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new guidance application is mixed among the various elements that include retrospective, prospective, and modified retrospective transition methods. Management is currently evaluating the impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations and related disclosures. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance relating to credit losses. The amendments require a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected through the use of allowances for credit losses valuation account. The income statement will reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, beginning after December 15, 2018. The new guidance application is mixed among the various elements that include modified retrospective and prospective transition methods. Management is currently evaluating the impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations and related disclosures. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance to reduce existing diversity in practice in regards to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance specifically addresses the following items: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interest in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new guidance is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented at the date of adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact on the Company's related disclosures.

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is based upon the consolidated financial statements of Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company"), which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted ("GAAP") in the United States, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements, including related notes, and MD A contained in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements, including related notes, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on April 18, 2016. All references to earnings per share ("EPS") contained in this report are diluted EPS unless otherwise noted. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
    
  In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, the Company's management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental costs, pension and other postretirement benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, income taxes, and purchase accounting. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company's management believes the critical accounting estimates described in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K are the most important to the fair presentation of the Company's financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most significant judgments in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
    
  Non-GAAP financial measures, and the accompanying reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, are presented in "Overview", "Results of Operations", "Summary by Operating Segment", and "2016 Outlook" in this MD A. 
    
  Company Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  In addition to evaluating the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows as reported in accordance with GAAP, Eastman management also evaluates Company and operating segment performance, and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions, excluding the effect of transactions, costs, and losses or gains that do not directly arise from Eastman's normal, or "core", business and operations, or are otherwise of an unusual or non-recurring nature. These transactions, costs, and losses or gains relate to, among other things, cost reductions, growth and profitability improvement initiatives, and other events outside of core business operations (such as asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, costs of and related to acquisitions, gains and losses from and costs related to dispositions of businesses, financing transaction costs, and mark-to-market ("MTM") losses or gains for pension and other postretirement benefit plans). Because non-core, unusual, or non-recurring transactions, costs, and losses or gains may materially affect the Company's, or any particular operating segment's, financial condition or results in a specific period in which they are recognized, Eastman believes it is appropriate to evaluate both the financial measures prepared and calculated in accordance with GAAP and the related non-GAAP financial measures excluding the effect on our results of these non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. In addition to using such measures to evaluate results in a specific period, management evaluates such non-GAAP measures, and believes that investors may also evaluate such measures, because such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's, and its segments', operational performance on a period-over-period historical basis and, as a result, provide a better indication of expected future trends. Management discloses these non-GAAP measures, and the related reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer term period-over-period performance, and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess the Company's, and its operating segments', performance, make resource allocation decisions and evaluate organizational and individual performance in determining certain performance-based compensation. Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP, and may be defined differently by, and not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on any non-GAAP measure, but to consider such measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
    
  Non-GAAP Measures in this Quarterly Report 
    
  The following non-core items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain results in this Quarterly Report, in each case for the periods and in the amounts in the table below: 

Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, of which asset impairments are non-cash transactions impacting profitability;  
                
    MTM pension and other postretirement benefit plans losses resulting from interim remeasurements of a UK pension plan obligation; 
                
    Acquisition integration and transaction costs;  
                
    Costs resulting from the sale of acquired inventories at fair value, net of the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") impact for certain of these inventories (as required by purchase accounting, these inventories were marked to fair value);  
                 
    Cost of disposition of claims against operations that were discontinued by Solutia, Inc., ("Solutia") prior to the Company's acquisition of Solutia in 2012; and 
                
    Gain from the sale of the Company's   50 percent   interest in the Primester joint venture.

  Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  Alternative Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures 
    
  In addition to the non-GAAP measures presented in this Quarterly Report and other periodic reports, from time to time management evaluates and discloses to investors and securities analysts the non-GAAP measure cash provided by operating activities excluding certain non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items ("cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted") when analyzing, among other things, business performance, liquidity and financial position, and performance-based compensation. Management uses this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the GAAP measure cash provided by operating activities because it believes it is a more appropriate metric to evaluate the cash flows from Eastman's core operations that are available for organic and inorganic growth initiatives and because it allows for a more consistent period-over-period presentation of such amounts. In its evaluation, management generally excludes the impact of certain non-core activities and decisions of management because such activities and decisions are not considered core, ongoing components of operations and the decisions to undertake or not to undertake such activities may be made irrespective of the cash generated from operations. From time to time, management discloses this non-GAAP measure and the related reconciliation to investors and securities analysts to allow them to better understand and evaluate the information used by management in its decision making processes and because management believes investors and securities analysts use similar measures to assess Company performance, liquidity, and financial position over multiple periods and to compare these with other companies. 
  
   33 

                      Table of Contents  

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Similarly, from time to time, Eastman may disclose to investors and securities analysts an alternative non-GAAP measure of "free cash flow", which management defines as cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, described above, less the amount of capital expenditures. Management believes such items are generally funded from available cash and, as such, should be considered in determining free cash flow. Management believes this is an appropriate metric to assess the Company's ability to fund priorities for uses of cash. The priorities for cash after funding operations include payment of quarterly dividends, additional repayment of debt, inorganic growth opportunities, and from time to time repurchasing shares. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities analysts in order to provide them with information similar to that used by management in evaluating potential future cash available for various initiatives and because management believes investors and securities analysts often use a similar measure of free cash flow to compare the results, and value, of comparable companies. In addition, Eastman may disclose to investors and securities analysts an alternative non-GAAP measure of "free cash flow yield", which management defines as annual free cash flow divided by the Company's market capitalization. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities analysts in comparing cash flow generation with that of peer and other companies. 
    
  Alternative Non-GAAP Earnings Measures 
    
  From time to time, Eastman may also disclose to investors and securities analysts the non-GAAP earnings measures "Adjusted EBITDA", "EBITDA Margin", and "Return on Invested Capital" (or "ROIC"). Management defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (net earnings or net earnings per share before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted to exclude the same non-core, unusual, and non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods. EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the GAAP measure sales revenue in the Company's income statement for the same periods. Management defines ROIC as net income plus interest expense after tax divided by average total borrowings plus average stockholders' equity for the periods presented, each derived from the GAAP measures in the Company's financial statements for the periods presented. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and ROIC are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of and returns from Eastman's operating businesses, and from time to time uses such measures in internal performance calculations. Further, management understands that investors and securities analysts often use similar measures of Adjusted EBITDA and ROIC to compare the results, returns, and value of the Company with those of other companies. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  The Company's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Additives   Functional Products ("AFP"), Advanced Materials ("AM"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. Eastman is focused on consistent earnings growth through a market-driven approach that takes advantage of the Company's existing technology platforms, global market and manufacturing presence, and leading positions in key end markets such as transportation, building and construction, and consumables. Management believes that the Company's end-market diversity is a source of strength, and that many of the markets into which the Company's products are sold are benefiting from longer-term global trends such as energy efficiency, a rising middle class in emerging economies, and an increased focus on health and wellness. Management believes that these trends, combined with the diversity of the Company's end markets, facilitate more consistent demand for the Company's products over time.  
    
  The Company generated sales revenue of   $2.3 billion   and   $2.4 billion   in   third quarter     2016   and   2015  , respectively. Sales revenue decreased   $160 million   in   third quarter     2016   compared to   third quarter     2015  , primarily due to lower selling prices in all operating segments and lower Fibers segment sales volume more than offsetting higher sales volumes in the other operating segments. 
    
  The Company generated sales revenue of   $6.8 billion   and   $7.4 billion   in   first nine months   2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales revenue decreased   $603 million   in   first nine months     2016   compared to   first nine months     2015  , primarily due to lower selling prices in all operating segments and lower Fibers segment sales volume more than offsetting higher AM segment sales volume. 
    
  Operating earnings were   $356 million   in   third quarter     2016   compared with   $432 million   in   third quarter     2015  . Excluding the non-core items identified in "Non-GAAP Financial Measures", operating earnings in   third quarter     2016   and   2015   were   $416 million   and   $459 million  , respectively. Adjusted operating earnings decreased in third quarter 2016 as an increase in the AM segment was more than offset by declines in the other operating segments.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Sales 

Sales revenue decreased   $160 million   in   third quarter     2016   compared to   third quarter     2015  , primarily due to lower selling prices in all operating segments and lower Fibers segment sales volume more than offsetting higher sales volumes in the other operating segments.

Gross Profit 

Gross profit in third quarter and first nine months 2016 included an $18 million MTM loss as a result of a change to a UK pension plan which triggered an interim remeasurement of the plan obligation. Gross profit in first nine months 2015 included a $2 million MTM loss in the Fibers segment due to an interim remeasurement of a UK pension plan obligation triggered by the closure of the Workington, UK acetate tow manufacturing site. Gross profit in first nine months 2015 was negatively impacted $7 million in the AM segment by the sale of Commonwealth Laminating and Coating, Inc. ("Commonwealth") inventories, which were marked to fair value in the acquisition of Commonwealth. Excluding these non-core items, gross profit   decreased   in   third quarter     2016   compared with   third quarter     2015   as an increase in the AM segment of $22 million was more than offset by declines in the other operating segments of $80 million. Excluding these non-core items, gross profit   decreased   in   first nine months     2016   compared with   first nine months     2015   primarily due to a decline in the CI segment of $172 million. Gross profit in third quarter and first nine months 2016 includes the benefit of reduced labor and manufacturing costs from corporate cost reduction actions in first half 2016. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   

SG A expenses in third quarter and first nine months 2016 included a $12 million MTM loss as a result of a change to a UK pension plan which triggered an interim remeasurement of the plan obligation. Included in first nine months 2016 SG A expenses are transaction costs for final resolution of the 2011 Sterling Chemicals, Inc. acquisition purchase price and integration costs for the Commonwealth business acquired in December 2014. Included in third quarter and first nine months 2015 SG A expenses are integration and transaction costs associated with the Taminco Corporation ("Taminco") and Commonwealth acquisitions. Excluding these non-core items, SG A expenses   decreased   in   third quarter   and   first nine months     2016   compared with   third quarter   and   first nine months     2015   primarily due to lower costs resulting from corporate cost reduction actions in first half 2016.

Asset Impairments and Restructuring 

As part of the Company's previously announced plan to reduce approximately $100 million of costs primarily in 2017, the Company recognized restructuring charges of   $30 million   for severance in third quarter 2016. 
    
  In first nine months 2016, there was a gain of   $2 million   in the AFP segment for the sale of previously impaired assets at the Crystex        research and development ("R D") site in France. 
    
  As a result of the annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, in third quarter 2015 the Company recognized intangible asset impairments of $18 million in the AM segment primarily to reduce the carrying value of the V-Kool        window films products trade name to the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value was determined using an income approach, specifically, the relief from royalty method. The impairment resulted from a decrease in projected revenues since the tradename was acquired from Solutia in 2012. The decrease in projected revenues was primarily due to the Asian economic downturn impacting car sales growth in those geographic markets. 
    
  In first nine months 2015, net asset impairments and restructuring charges included   $81 million   of fixed asset impairments and   $14 million   of restructuring charges, including severance, in the Fibers segment due to the closure of the Workington, UK acetate tow manufacturing site. Management expected annual cost savings in the Fibers segment of approximately $20 million as a result of the closure and those cost savings have been realized as of the end of the third quarter 2016. Additionally, in   first nine months   2015, management decided not to continue a growth initiative that was reported in "Other". This resulted in the Company recognizing fixed asset and goodwill impairments of   $8 million   and restructuring charges of   $4 million  . Additionally, during first nine months 2015, net asset impairments and restructuring charges included $4 million of restructuring charges primarily for severance associated with the integration of Taminco.

Early Debt Extinguishment Costs 
    
  On May 26,   2016  , the Company sold euro-denominated 1.50% notes due 2023 in the principal amount of    550 million   (  $614 million  ). Proceeds from the sale of the notes, net of transaction costs, were used for the early repayment of   $500 million   of 2.4% notes due June 2017 and repayment of other borrowings. The early repayment resulted in a charge of   $9 million   for early debt extinguishment costs primarily attributable to the early redemption premium and related unamortized costs. For additional information regarding the early extinguishment costs, see   Note 7, "Borrowings",   to the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Other Charges (Income), Net 

Included in other charges (income), net are losses or gains on foreign exchange transactions, equity investments, business venture investments, and non-operating assets. Foreign exchange transaction losses (gains), net include the revaluation of foreign entity assets and liabilities partially offset by gains and losses from certain derivative instruments, both items impacted primarily by the euro. See   Note 8, "Derivative and Non-Derivative Financial Instruments",   to the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
    
  First nine months     2016   other charges (income), net includes a gain of   $17 million   from the sale of the Company's interest in the Primester joint venture equity investment. For additional information, see   Note 4, "Equity Investments",   to the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Provision for Income Taxes   

The third quarter and first nine months 2016 effective tax rates reflect a benefit from the extension of favorable U.S. federal tax provisions, primarily R D tax credits and deferral of certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries from U.S. income taxes in fourth quarter of 2015. The favorable tax provisions will benefit all quarters in 2016, compared to only fourth quarter in 2015. The third quarter and first nine months 2016 effective tax rates include a tax benefit of   $16 million   related to foreign tax credits as a result of the amendment of prior year income tax returns. The first nine months 2016 effective tax rate includes a   $16 million   one-time benefit for the restoration of tax basis for which depreciation deductions were previously limited and a   $9 million   tax benefit primarily due to adjustments to the tax provision to reflect the finalization of 2014 foreign income tax returns. The first nine months 2015 effective tax rate included a   $6 million   benefit from the settlement of non-U.S. income tax audits offset by an unfavorable foreign rate variance due to increased earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions. 
    
  Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings per Share 

(1)   
    UK statutory tax rate was used because the expense was attributed to a UK operation.  
               (2)   
    Blended tax rates for the tax jurisdictions where the expenses are deductible were used. 
               (3)   
    A U.S. corporate tax rate comprised of the U.S. federal rate plus a blended state rate was used. 
               (4)   
    Blended statutory rates for the tax jurisdictions where the expenses are deductible were used. First nine months 2016 also included a tax benefit from resolution of tax deductions for 2014 asset impairments.

SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT 
    
  The Company's products and operations are managed and reported in   four   operating segments: Additives   Functional Products ("AFP"), Advanced Materials ("AM"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. For additional financial and product information for each segment, see the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 18, 2016.  
    
  Additives   Functional Products Segment 

Sales revenue in   third quarter     2016   decreased compared to   third quarter     2015   due to lower selling prices partially offset by higher sales volume, across the segment. The lower selling prices are attributed to lower raw material and energy costs and competitive pressure across the segment, particularly in Asia Pacific. 
    
  Sales revenue in   first nine months     2016   decreased compared to   first nine months     2015   due to lower selling prices attributed to lower raw material and energy costs and competitive pressure across the segment, particularly in Asia Pacific. 
    
  Operating earnings decreased in   third quarter     2016   compared to   third quarter     2015   primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material and energy costs by $23 million, partially offset by higher sales volume of $3 million. 
    
  Operating earnings in   first nine months     2016   included a $2 million gain for the sale of previously impaired assets at the Crystex        R D site in France. Excluding this non-core item, operating earnings decreased in   first nine months     2016   compared to   first nine months     2015   primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material and energy costs by $32 million.

Advanced Materials Segment    

Sales revenue in   third quarter   and   first nine months     2016   increased compared to   third quarter   and   first nine months     2015   primarily due to higher sales volume of premium products, including Eastman Tritan        copolyester, Saflex        acoustic interlayers, and automotive performance films, partially offset by lower selling prices, primarily for other copolyesters, attributed to lower raw material and energy costs. 
    
  Operating earnings in third quarter and first nine months 2015 included $18 million of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, primarily to reduce the carrying value of trade names in the window films market to their estimated current fair value. Operating earnings in first nine months 2015 included additional costs of acquired Commonwealth inventories of $7 million.  
    
  Excluding the non-core items, operating earnings in   third quarter   and   first nine months     2016   increased compared to   third quarter   and   first nine months     2015   primarily due to the combined impact of higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products and lower unit costs due to higher capacity utilization of $26 million and $69 million, respectively.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Sales revenue in   third quarter     2016   decreased compared to   third quarter     2015   due to lower selling prices. The lower selling prices were primarily attributed to the negative impact of continued competitive pressures due to lower oil prices and weak demand in Asia Pacific. 
    
  Sales revenue in   first nine months     2016   decreased compared to   first nine months     2015   due to lower selling prices. The lower selling prices were primarily attributed to the negative impact of lower market prices for propylene, ethylene, and methanol and continued competitive pressures due to lower oil prices and weak demand in Asia Pacific. 
    
  Operating earnings decreased in   third quarter     2016   compared to   third quarter     2015   primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material and energy costs and the reduced negative impact of commodity hedges on raw material costs, primarily for propane, by $44 million. 
    
  Operating earnings decreased in   first nine months     2016   compared to   first nine months     2015   primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material and energy costs by $166 million. 
    
  Fibers Segment   

Sales revenue in   third quarter   and   first nine months     2016   decreased compared to   third quarter   and   first nine months     2015   primarily due to lower sales volume and lower selling prices, particularly for acetate tow. Lower acetate tow sales volume was primarily due to reduced sales in China attributed to weaker demand and customer backward integration and inventory destocking. Lower acetate tow selling prices was primarily due to lower industry capacity utilization rates. 
  Operating earnings in   third quarter     2016   decreased compared to   third quarter     2015   primarily due to lower sales volume of $25 million and lower selling prices exceeding lower raw material and energy costs by $12 million, partially offset by lower  operating costs resulting from recent changes in segment business operations. 
    
  Operating earnings in first nine months 2015 included asset impairments and restructuring charges, net of $95 million for the closure of the Workington, UK acetate tow manufacturing site. Excluding this non-core item, operating earnings in   first nine months     2016   decreased compared to   first nine months     2015   primarily due to lower sales volume of $36 million and lower selling prices exceeding lower raw material and energy costs by $31 million, partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from changes in segment business operations and assets.

  With a substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman is subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets. To mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate payment terms in U.S. dollars or euros. In addition, the Company engages in foreign currency derivative transactions and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate. For additional information concerning these practices, see Note 10, "Derivatives", to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 and Part II, Item 7A "Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk" of the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Risk Factors" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Cash provided by operating activities was   $991 million   in   first nine months     2016   compared with   $1.1 billion   in   first nine months     2015  . The difference in cash from operating activities was primarily due to lower net earnings excluding non-core items in first nine months 2016 compared with first nine months 2015. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities decreased   $108 million   in   first nine months     2016   compared with   first nine months     2015   primarily due to $51 million less additions to properties and equipment, $37 million higher proceeds primarily from the sale of Primester, and $19 million less cash used for acquisitions.  
    
  Cash used in financing activities increased   $236 million   in   first nine months     2016   compared with   first nine months     2015   primarily due to an increase of $137 million in net repayment of borrowings and increases in share repurchases and dividend payments of $72 million and $25 million, respectively. Cash used in financing activities in   first nine months     2016   included cash provided by $607 million net proceeds from the sale of euro-denominated 1.50% notes due 2023 and $200 million from a $250 million accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "A/R Facility") borrowings, and cash used in repayment of $500 million of   2.4% notes due June 2017   (including $7 million early redemption premium), repayment of $350 million of A/R Facility borrowings, and repayment of $100 million of Term Loan borrowings.

  The Credit and A/R Facilities and the Term Loan contain a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. Total available borrowings under the Credit and A/R Facilities were   $1,275 million   and   $842 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. Changes in available borrowings were due primarily to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under the A/R Facility. The Company would not have violated applicable covenants for these periods if the total available amounts of the facilities had been borrowed. 
    
  In   first nine months 2016  , the Company made $50 million in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans.  
    
  Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. However, the Company's cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastman's products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Risk Factors" in this MD A. Eastman management believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with an investment grade credit rating is important to its long-term strategic and financial flexibility. 
    
  Capital Expenditures 
    
  Capital expenditures were   $375 million   and   $426 million   in   first nine months     2016   and   2015  , respectively, primarily for organic growth initiatives particularly in the AM and AFP segments and for manufacturing asset improvements. The Company expects that year-end 2016   capital spending to be between $600 million and $625 million  , including the continuation of the expansion projects in Kuantan, Kingsport, and Longview along with site modernization projects in Kingsport and Longview. 
    
  Treasury Stock 
    
  In February 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized repurchase of up to an additional $1 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the Company. As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of 6,171,629 shares have been repurchased under this authorization for a total amount of $473 million. 
    
  During   third quarter   and   first nine months     2016  , the Company repurchased 1,128,869 shares of common stock for a cost of $75 million and 1,760,940 shares of common stock for a cost of $120 million, respectively. During   third quarter   and   first nine months     2015  , the Company repurchased 221,578 shares of common stock for a cost of $17 million and 656,578 shares of common stock for a cost of $48 million, respectively.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Dividends 
    
  The Company declared cash dividends of $0.46 and $0.40 per share in   third quarter     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $1.38 and $1.20 per share in   first nine months     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements 
    
  If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it has guaranteed a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. For information on the Company's residual value guarantees, see   Note 10, "Commitments",   to the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, and other parties when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur. Non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company. The Company's current other guarantees include guarantees relating primarily to intellectual property, environmental matters, and other indemnifications and have arisen through the normal course of business. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims, if they were to occur. These other guarantees have terms up to   30 years   with maximum potential future payments of approximately   $35 million   in the aggregate, with none of these guarantees being individually significant to the Company's operating results, financial position, or liquidity. The Company's current expectation is that future payment or performance related to non-performance under other guarantees is considered remote. 
    
  The Company has rights and obligations under non-recourse factoring facilities that have a combined limit of    158 million   (  $177 million  ) as of   September 30, 2016   and are committed until December 2017. These arrangements include receivables in the United States, Belgium, Germany, and Finland, and are subject to various eligibility requirements. The Company sells the receivables at face value but receives funding (approximately   85 percent  ) net of a deposit amount until collections are received from customers for the receivables sold. The total amounts of cumulative receivables sold in   third quarter   and   first nine months 2016  , were approximately   $220 million   and   $680 million  , respectively. The total amounts of cumulative receivables sold in   third quarter   and   first nine months 2015  , were approximately   $245 million   and   $780 million  , respectively. As part of the program, the Company continues to service the sold receivables at market rates with no servicing assets or liabilities recognized. The amounts of sold receivables outstanding under the non-recourse factoring facilities were   $105 million   and   $106 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of the receivables sold equals the carrying value at the time of the sale, and no gain or loss is recognized. The Company is exposed to a credit loss of up to   10 percent   on sold receivables.  
    
  Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations 
    
  Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and post-closure under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastman's policies described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   The Company's total reserve for environmental contingencies was   $325 million   and   $336 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , this reserve included   $8 million   related to sites previously closed and impaired by Eastman and sites that have been divested by Eastman but for which the Company retains the environmental liability related to these sites.  
    
  The Company's total environmental reserve that management believes to be probable and estimable for environmental contingencies, including remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, is included as part of "Payables and other current liabilities" and "Other long-term liabilities" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as follows:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Remediation 
    
  Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs ranged from the minimum or best estimate of   $300 million   to the maximum of   $510 million   and from the minimum or best estimate of   $308 million   to the maximum of   $516 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The maximum estimated future costs are considered to be reasonably possible and include the amounts accrued at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   Although the resolution of uncertainties related to these environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, because of the availability of legal defenses, the Company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's consolidated financial position or cash flows. 
    
  Reserves for environmental remediation include liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years.   The amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are included within "Cost of sales" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. Changes in the reserves for environmental remediation liabilities during first nine months 2016 are summarized below: 

Closure/Post-Closure 
    
  An asset retirement obligation is an obligation for the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. The Company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful life. Environmental asset retirement obligations consist primarily of closure and post-closure costs. For sites that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate accrued to date over the sites' estimated useful lives for these environmental asset retirement obligation costs was     $25 million   and   $28 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Other 
    
  The Company also has contractual asset retirement obligations not associated with environmental liabilities. Eastman's non-environmental asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the future closure of leased manufacturing assets at Pace, Florida and Oulu, Finland. These accrued non-environmental asset retirement obligations were     $46 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

2016 OUTLOOK 
    
  Eastman is focused on consistent earnings growth through a market-driven approach that takes advantage of the Company's existing technology platforms, global market and manufacturing presence, leading positions in key end markets, vertically integrated manufacturing streams, and advantaged cost positions. This focus is supported by the Company's end-market and geographic diversity as it serves global markets and offers both original equipment manufacturing and after-market products in a variety of end markets, such as transportation, building and construction, and consumables. 
    
  Management expects that market prices for commodity products and raw material and energy costs will continue to be volatile, and will continue to evaluate and use pricing strategies to mitigate this volatility. Management expects that the significant declines in crude oil and certain related commodity prices will not be fully reflected in Company raw material and energy costs primarily because the positive impact will be largely offset in 2016 by our current commodity hedges, particularly for propane. Management also expects the strength of the U.S. dollar in recent periods to continue to have an overall negative impact on the Company's results, partially offset by hedging of those foreign currencies, particularly the euro. 
    
  For full year 2016, management also expects: 

operating results to continue to benefit from organic growth and improved product mix from continued market 
     adoption of specialty products; 
             
    cost reduction actions to result in cost savings of approximately $100 million in 2016, and additional cost reduction actions in second half 2016 to result in further cost savings of approximately $100 million, primarily in 2017;  
                
    acquisition costs and tax synergies; 
                
    cash generated by operating activities of approximately $1.5 billion; 
                 
    priorities for uses of available cash in 2016 include payment of the quarterly dividend, repayment of debt, funding targeted growth initiatives, and repurchasing shares  ; and 
                
    the full year effective tax rate on reported earnings before income tax to be between 22 and 23 percent, excluding non-core items. 
       
  Based on the foregoing expectations and assumptions, management expects that 2016 earnings per share excluding the non-core items in first nine months 2016 detailed under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in this MD A and any non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items in fourth quarter 2016 to be between $6.70 and $6.80. The Company's fourth quarter 2016 financial results forecasts do not include non-core items (such as MTM pension and other postretirement benefit gains or loss in fourth quarter 2016) or any unusual or non-recurring items, and management accordingly is unable to reconcile projected full-year 2016 earnings excluding non-core and any unusual or non-recurring items to reported GAAP earnings without unreasonable efforts. 
    
  See "Risk Factors" below. 

RISK FACTORS  
    
  In addition to the factors described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, the following are the most significant known factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report and elsewhere from time to time. See "Forward-looking Statements". 
    
  Continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and the financial markets could negatively impact the Company. 
    
  Continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and global capital markets may adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The Company's business and operating results were affected by the impact of the last global recession, including the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that affected the global economy. Continuing deterioration and weakness of the global economy and financial markets and uncertainty over timing and extent of recovery have adversely affected the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, the Company's ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms could be constrained, which may negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives.

                      Table of Contents  

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results. 
    
  The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. These risk mitigation measures cannot eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations and have from time-to-time reduced the positive impact of unexpected decreases of the market price of purchased raw materials. In addition, natural disasters, plant interruptions, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities, could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities. 
    
  Loss or financial weakness of any of the Company's largest customers could adversely affect our financial results. 
    
  Although the Company has an extensive customer base, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of our largest customers could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced. No assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. 
    
  The Company's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing businesses, including cyber risks, any of which could disrupt manufacturing operations or related infrastructure and adversely affect results of operations. 
    
  As a global specialty chemicals manufacturing company, our business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling, and transportation including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. Significant limitation on the Company's ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales revenue, costs, results of operations, and financial condition. Disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error, or process failures; or external factors such as computer or equipment malfunction at third-party service providers, natural disasters, pandemic illness, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, cyber attacks, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the Company or for delivery of products to customers. The Company has in the past experienced cyber attacks and breaches of its computer information systems, and although none of these has had a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, no assurances can be provided that any future disruptions due to these, or other, circumstances will not have a material effect on operations. Such disruptions could result in an unplanned event that could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations, neighbors, and the environment, and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations. 
    
  Growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require a significant use of resources in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives. 
    
  The Company continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both organic growth initiatives and inorganic initiatives. These growth opportunities include development and commercialization or licensing of innovative new products and technologies and related employee leadership, expertise, and skill development and retention, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, and alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the Company's portfolio of businesses and capabilities. There can be no assurance that such innovation, development and commercialization or licensing efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances (including integration of acquired businesses) will result in financially successful commercialization of products, or acceptance by existing or new customers, or successful entry into new markets or otherwise achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Company's results of operations. There also can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of proposed acquisitions or licensing, expected benefits of proposed acquisitions or licensing, completion of integration plans, and synergies therefrom. There also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. Any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from any proposed or current investments and projects.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Significant acquisitions expose the Company to risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
    
  While acquisitions have been and continue to be a part of the Company's growth strategy, acquisitions of large companies (such as the acquisition of Taminco and Solutia) subject the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman. These include, but are not limited to the possibilities that the financial performance of the acquired business may be significantly worse than expected; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the Company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the Company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other "synergies" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the new business resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the Company's existing businesses; and that the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business into Eastman or that the integration efforts will not achieve the expected benefits. 
    
  The Company's substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  More than half of the Company's sales for 2015 were to customers outside of North America. The Company expects sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of the Company's sales. Also, a significant portion of manufacturing capacity is located outside of the United States. Accordingly, the Company's business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. In addition, foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax Eastman's foreign income, or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls. Certain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with Eastman's global scope. For example, it may be more difficult for Eastman to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems, and the laws of some countries may not protect the Company's intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect Eastman's intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could result in loss of valuable proprietary information. There is also risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where Eastman operates. Social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with Eastman's corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where Eastman operates are a risk to the Company's financial performance. As Eastman continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse effect on Eastman's business, financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Legislative or regulatory actions could increase the Company's future compliance costs. 
    
  The Company and its facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. For example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. Specifically, pending and proposed U.S. Federal legislation and regulation increase the likelihood that the Company's manufacturing sites will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy, which legislation and regulation, if enacted, may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the Company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the Company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the Company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. The foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the Company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under "Outlook" and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Quarterly Report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the SEC or in Company press releases) on related subjects.

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  Contemporaneously with its sale on May 26, 2016 of euro-denominated 1.50% notes due 2023 in the principal amount of  550 million ($614 million), the Company designated these borrowings as a non-derivative hedge of a portion of its net investment in one of its euro functional currency denominated subsidiaries to protect the designated net investment against foreign currency fluctuations. At September 30, 2016, a 10% fluctuation in the euro currency rate would have a $61 million impact on the designated net investment value in the foreign subsidiary. As a result of the designation of the euro-denominated borrowings as a hedge of the net investment, foreign currency translation gains and losses on the borrowings are recorded as a component of the "Change in cumulative translation adjustment" within "Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. Therefore, a foreign currency change in the designated investment value of the foreign subsidiary will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-denominated borrowings. 
    
  Excluding the net investment hedge discussed above, there have been no other material changes to the Company's market risks from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
       
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of   September 30, 2016   the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed was accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   third quarter   of   2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. 
    OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
       
  General 
    
  From time to time, Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company") and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters (including the Solutia Inc. ("Solutia") Legacy Torts Claims described below) will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Solutia Legacy Torts Claims Litigation 
    
  Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Settlement Agreement effective February 28, 2008, between Solutia and Monsanto Company ("Monsanto") in connection with Solutia's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings (the "Monsanto Settlement Agreement"), Monsanto is responsible to defend and indemnify Solutia against any Legacy Tort Claims (as defined in the Monsanto Settlement Agreement) and Solutia agreed to retain responsibility for certain tort claims, if any, that may arise from Solutia's conduct after its spinoff from Pharmacia Corporation (f/k/a Monsanto), which occurred on September 1, 1997. Solutia, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Eastman on July 2, 2012, has been named as a defendant in several such proceedings, and has submitted the matters to Monsanto as Legacy Tort Claims. To the extent these matters are not within the meaning of Legacy Tort Claims, Solutia could potentially be liable thereunder. In connection with the completion of its acquisition of Solutia, Eastman guaranteed the obligations of Solutia and Eastman was added as an indemnified party under the Monsanto Settlement Agreement.

ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
   (c)  Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer 
    
  In February 2014, the Board of Directors authorized repurchase of up to an additional $1 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of 6,171,629 shares have been repurchased under this authorization for a total amount of $473 million. During   first nine months     2016  , the Company repurchased 1,760,940 shares of common stock for a cost of $120 million. For additional information, see Note   13  , "  Stockholders' Equity  ", to the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

  5.4             CHANGE IN CONTROL  . 
    
  (a)             Vesting of Awards  .  Upon a Change in Control: (i) the terms of this Section 5.4 shall immediately become operative, without further action or consent by any person or entity; (ii) all conditions, restrictions, and limitations in effect on Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to this Plan shall immediately lapse as of the date of such event; (iii) no other terms, conditions, restrictions or limitations shall be imposed upon any such Awards on or after such date, and in no circumstance shall such Awards be forfeited on or after such date; and (iv) all such Awards shall automatically become one hundred percent (100%) vested immediately. 
    
  (b)             Valuation and Payment of Awards  .  Upon a Change in Control, each Non-Employee Director, whether or not continuing in service as a director of the Company in any capacity, shall be paid, in a single lump-sum cash payment, as soon as practicable but in no event later than seventy-five (75) days after the effective date of the Change in Control, the value of all of his or her outstanding Restricted Stock Awards.  For purposes of calculating the cash-out value of Awards for purposes of this Section 5.4, the Fair Market Value of Shares as of the date of the Change in Control shall be used as the Fair Market Value of the Shares. 

Exhibit 10.03 

5.5           DEFERRAL OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.

A Stock Deferral Election shall become irrevocable on the first day of the Deferral Year to which it relates. 
    
  (b)          The shares of Restricted Stock under an Annual Restricted Stock Award for which a Stock Deferral Election is made under this Section 5.5 and which became vested pursuant to Section 5.3 ( Vested Deferred Shares ) shall be converted as of the Vesting Date to a credit under the Deferred Compensation Plan and shall be credited to an account under that plan.  The amount credited to the Deferred Compensation Plan for the Vested Deferred Shares shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of such Vested Deferred Shares, determined as of the Vesting Date.  No shares of Stock shall be issued with respect to the Vested Deferred Shares.  An Eligible Participant s rights with respect to amounts credited to the Deferred Compensation Plan with respect to Vested Deferred Shares shall be governed by the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each and every Deferrable Amount, when initially credited to the Participant s Account, shall be credited to an investment fund other than the Stock Fund until the next date that dividends are paid on Common Stock and on such date the Deferrable Amount that would have been initially credited to the Stock Fund but for this sentence shall be deemed to be reallocated, as adjusted for earnings and losses, to the Stock Fund. 
    
  Section 5.3        Deferred Stock Accounts  .  An amount equal to the fair market value of the Vested Deferred Shares     covered by a Stock Deferral Election (a  Vested Deferred Share Credit ) shall be credited to an Eligible Director s Deferred Stock Account under this Plan in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Company stock compensation plan (and applicable subplan) under which such Stock Deferral Election was made.

Amounts credited to an Eligible Director s Deferred Stock Account shall be payable (along with any earnings thereon) in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 based on the manner of payment elected by the Eligible Director for any other amounts deferred by the Eligible Director under this Plan for the same Class Year as the Class Year in which the restricted stock award relating to the Vested Deferred Shares was granted to the Eligible Director.  If the Eligible Director did not elect to defer any cash compensation under this Plan for that Class Year or did not make a manner of payment election for any amount deferred for that Class Year, the Vested Deferred Share Credit (along with any earnings thereon) shall be paid in accordance with Section 8.4.  Payment of amounts credited to an Eligible Director s Deferred Stock Account shall also be governed by Sections 9, 10 and 17, as applicable.

Each Participant shall file an initial investment performance election with the Compensation Group with respect to the investment of the Participant s Account.  The election shall designate the investment fund or funds which shall be used to measure the investment performance of the Participant s Account.  The election shall be made within such time period and on such form as the Compensation Group may prescribe and shall be made in whole percentages of the Participant s Account balance or the Deferrable Amount to be credited to the Participant s Account, as applicable.  If the Participant does not file an investment performance election, his Account shall be credited with earnings and losses as if based on the performance of a default investment fund selected by the Company in its discretion. 

Exhibit 10.04 

Section 7.2        Changing Investment Performance Elections  .

In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, a Section 16 Insider s Deferrable Amount that is initially deemed to be invested in an investment fund other than the Stock Fund as provided in Section 5.2, shall be reallocated, following such initial allocation, to the Stock Fund in the manner provided in Section 5.2. 
    
  Section 7.4        Distributions.    All distributions from a Participant s Account shall be made in cash.  Pending the complete distribution of the Account of a Participant, the Participant shall continue to be able to make elections pursuant to this Section 7.

The amount distributed may not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Hardship or Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such Hardship or Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise by liquidation of the Participant s assets (to the extent liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). In addition, in the case of a distribution to meet an Unforeseeable Emergency, a distribution may not be made to the extent that such Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved by cessation of deferrals under the Plan.

Any individual that has been penalized in this six-month period for electing immediate withdrawal will be paid that penalty, and continuing participation will be allowed, if payout to all Participants under this section occurs.  Solely for purposes of this Section 10.3,  benefits  shall refer to amounts held in Grandfathered Accounts under this Plan.
