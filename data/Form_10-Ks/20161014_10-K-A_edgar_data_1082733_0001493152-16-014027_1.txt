Overview   

NuState
Energy Holdings, Inc. is a technology company specializing in providing pertinent, real-time information to the worldwide transportation
and security industries. NuState s proprietary software, GPSTrax, is built on an Open Architecture platform for the logistics
and telematics industries.  

We
believe there are many opportunities to leverage and monetize our software technology by licensing it to companies that provide
green technology solutions to medium and large logistics companies. In November 2014, NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. signed a definitive
agreement with The Ronn Motor Group, with offices in Dalian, China and the United States, to license and market GPSTrax in China
and other international markets.  

NuState
is launching a new GPSTrax Value-Added Reseller (VAR) Program, focusing on opportunities in consumer-based solutions such as asset
tracking. The VAR Program will increase awareness, availability and support of the GPSTrax solution at a time when a growing number
of companies are looking to update and optimize their solutions. We expect to generate revenues from this Program during fiscal
2017.  

Our
software technology provides validation and verification of fuel cost consumption reporting and fuel tax credits to logistics
companies. The software also is designed to document the exact amount of reduction of harmful emissions that results from the
alternative energy products. This data will enable users in certain countries to generate emissions credits that are tradable
under the protocol of the Kyoto Treaty.  

Through
our existing relationships in the country of Suriname, NuState is evaluating several projects in the alternative renewable energy
market in Suriname. NuState has been in discussions with AMPS, NV (  AMPS  ), based in Paramaribo, Suriname,
to enter into a license agreement with its partner, The Ronn Motor Group, in relation to the purchase of GPSTrax  for their
multi-million-dollar alternative energy projects. AMPS focuses on providing engineering, procurement and construction management
(EPC) services, Power Transmission   Distribution, Renewable and Conventional Energy as well as Power Management Systems to
Suriname and its fellow Caribbean Community members.  

Employees   

At
September 30, 2016, we had 2 full time employees.  

Our
principal offices are located at 401 E. Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 1400, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301. Our telephone number is (954)
712-7487.  

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol  NSEH .  

Item
1A. Risk Factors   

The
common shares of our Company are considered speculative. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in
addition to other information in this annual report in evaluating our Company and our business before purchasing our common shares.
Our business, operating or financial condition could be harmed due to any of the following risks:  

Our
auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern .   

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. Since inception we have experienced recurring
net losses which losses caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $41.5 million as of June 30, 2016. These factors, among
others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

We
currently have a working capital deficit and negative cash flow from operations, and are uncertain if and when we will be able
to pay our current liabilities.    

Our
working capital deficit was approximately $4.5 million as of June 30, 2016. This deficit consists of $1,806 in current assets,
offset by $4,500,863 in current liabilities. In addition, we had negative cash flow from operations for the year ended June 30,
2016 of approximately $424,000. We do not have any liquid or other assets that can be liquidated to pay our current liabilities
while we continue to incur additional liabilities to our officer and certain service providers who are working to prepare the
documents required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to enable our common shares to be registered for trading.
Since we currently have limited operations, the only ways we have of paying our current liabilities are to issue our common or
preferred shares to our creditors or to issue unsecured promissory notes which may include certain features such as convertibility
into common or preferred shares or warrants to purchase additional common or preferred shares in the future.  

We
currently do not have sufficient capital to finance the anticipated recurring costs of being a publicly-traded company.    

As
of September 30, 2016, we had minimal cash on hand. We anticipate incurring incremental annual costs of approximately $180,000
related to being a publicly-traded company. We will need to raise additional capital to support our public-company-related activities.  

We
had $3,232,885 of convertible notes, notes payable, and accrued interest payable as of June 30, 2016, of which of this amount
$2,892,885 currently past due, and do not have the funds necessary to pay these obligations.    

In
addition to funding our operating expenses, we need capital to pay various debt obligations totaling approximately $3.2 million
as of June 30, 2016 which are either currently past due or which are due in the current fiscal year. Currently, there is $1,442,314
principal amount of the convertible notes payable which is past due, $215,241 principal of the notes payable which is past due,
and $1,235,330 of accrued interest which is past due. The interest on the past due principal amounts will continue to accrue monthly
at their stated rates. Holders of past due notes do not have a security interest in our assets. The existence of these obligations
provides additional challenges to us in our efforts to raise capital to fund our operations.  

We
have $673,200 of undeclared accumulative dividends as of June 30, 2016 and we may not be able to settle this obligation in cash
or stocks.    

In
addition to funding our operating expenses, we need capital to pay undeclared cumulative dividends totaling approximately $673,200
as of June 30, 2016. The existence of these obligations provides additional challenges to us in our efforts to raise capital to
fund our operations.  

In
the event we consummate a transaction with a profitable company, we may not be able to utilize our net operating loss carryover
which may have a negative impact on your investment.    

If
we enter into a combination with a business that has operating income, we cannot assure you that we will be able to utilize all
or even a portion of our existing net operating loss carryover for federal or state tax purposes following such a business combination.
If we are unable to make use of our existing net operating loss carryover, the tax advantages of such a combination may be limited,
which could negatively impact the price of our stock and the value of your investment. These factors will substantially increase
the uncertainty, and thus the risk, of investing in our shares.  

Economic
conditions may affect our ability to obtain financing and to complete a merger or acquisition.    

Due
to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries, and shortages of available capital,
our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will need. In the presence
of these economic conditions, we may have difficulty raising sufficient capital to support the investigation of potential business
opportunities, and to consummate a merger or acquisition. These factors substantially increase the uncertainty, and thus the risk,
of investing in our shares.  

There
are a number of factors related to our common stock which may have an adverse effect on our shareholders.    

Shareholders 
interests in our Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share if we issue additional
shares or raise funds through the sale of equity securities. In the event that we are required to issue additional shares, enter
into private placements to raise financing through the sale of equity securities or acquire business interests in the future from
the issuance of shares of our common stock to acquire such interests, the interests of existing shareholders in our Company will
be diluted and existing shareholders may suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such
securities are sold. If we do issue additional shares, it will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power
of all existing shareholders.  

We
have certain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and there are other provisions under Florida law, that may
serve to make a takeover of our Company more difficult.    

Provisions
of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a takeover which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.
Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, which include when and by
whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt. In addition, certain
provisions of Florida law also may be deemed to have certain anti-takeover effects which include that control of shares acquired
in excess of certain specified thresholds will not possess any voting rights unless these voting rights are approved by a majority
of a corporation s disinterested stockholders.  

Our
common stock is quoted in the over the counter market on the OTC Pink.    

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink. OTC Pink offers a quotation service to companies that are unable to list their securities
on an exchange or for companies, such as ours, whose securities are not eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. The
requirements for quotation on the OTC Pink are considerably lower and less regulated than those of the OTC Bulletin Board or an
exchange. Because our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink, it is possible that even fewer brokers or dealers would be interested
in making a market in our common stock which further adversely impacts its liquidity.  

The
tradability of our common stock is limited under the penny stock regulations which may cause the holders of our common stock difficulty
should they wish to sell their shares.    

Because
the quoted price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share, our common stock is considered a  penny stock, 
and trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, broker/dealers
who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special
sales practice requirements. The broker/dealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser
and receive the purchaser s written consent prior to the transaction. SEC regulations also require additional disclosure
in connection with any trades involving a  penny stock,  including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction,
of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks. These requirements severely limit the liquidity
of securities in the secondary market because few broker or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities and this
limited liquidity will make it more difficult for an investor to sell his shares of our common stock in the secondary market should
the investor wish to liquidate the investment. In addition to the applicability of the penny stock rules, other risks associated
with trading in penny stocks could also be price fluctuations and the lack of a liquid market.

We
know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material
proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered
or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.

the exception of dividends on our Series B Preferred Shares. It is the present intention of management to utilize all available
funds for the development of our business. The holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive annual dividends of
10% payable in cash or shares of our common stock, at our option.

Report on Form 10-K.  

Overview   

The
company was incorporated in Nevada as Jaguar Investments, Inc. during October 1987. During March 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company merged with Freight Rate, Inc., a development stage company in the logistics software business. During May 2003,
the Company changed its name to Power2Ship, Inc. During October 2006, the Company merged with a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary,
Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with the Company surviving but its name changed to Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc.
effective November 2006. During December 2007, the Company merged with a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, NuState Energy
Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with the Company surviving but renamed NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. effective December
2007.  

On
February 12, 2009, the Company filed Form 15 to terminate registration of its common stock under section 12(g) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and subsequently has not submitted any filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the period
from February 2009 through April 2010, the Company had several changes to its officers and directors and moved its offices twice.
The Company s Chairman and President since April 2010, and its Chief Executive Officer from July 2010, is Kevin Yates. The
Company s headquarters is located at 401 E. Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 1400, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301. Since April 2010,
the Company s current management developed, and began implementing, the following strategic plan designed to increase the
Company s shareholders  value:  

1.
      
      Improve
    the Company s balance sheet by reducing liabilities and regaining use of certain of its intellectual property and software,   

2.
      
      Settle
    litigation,   

3.
      
      Identify

    its intellectual property and software, also known as My Driver s Seat, which it regained in April 2010.   

This
strategic plan has resulted in the following material events:  

Reduced
Liabilities   

Since
filing its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2008, total liabilities have decreased by $5,187,087 or 53%
from $9,687,950 on September 30, 2008 to $4,500,863 on June 30, 2016.  

In
August 2012, its former subsidiaries CXT and P2SI each filed a Voluntary Bankruptcy Petition and Schedules in the United States
Bankruptcy Court in the District of South Carolina. On October 19, 2012, the Company was awarded the bankruptcy and has filed
the proper paperwork and as a result has reduced its liabilities by $1,875,581.  

Regained
Use of Intellectual Property   

As
part of an agreement entered into with Rentar Environmental Solutions, Inc. ( Rentar ) in April 2010, the Company
agreed to share with Rentar all right, title and interest in and to intellectual properties and software, My Driver s Seat,
which it had developed for the worldwide transportation and security industries and had sold in April 2008 to Rentar Logic, a
Delaware corporation and an affiliate of Rentar. The intellectual property that the Company agreed to share with Rentar included
a patent titled  Dynamic and Predictive Information System and Method for Shipping Assets and Transport .  

Licensing
Use of Intellectual Property   

NuState
Energy Holdings, Inc. signed a definitive agreement with The Ronn Motor Group, with offices in Dalian, China and the United States,
to license and market NuState s IP software, GPSTrax , for use by Ronn Motor Group s partners in China and other
international markets. On February 26, 2016, we agreed to suspend the definitive agreement with Ronn Motor Group as Ronn Motor
Group is going through a corporate restructuring. On February 26, 2016 we entered into a binding Letter of Intent with MK Technologies
LLC (a related party to Ronn Motor Group), in relation to the purchase of its fuel enhancement technologies and all its Assets,
for total consideration of $2,000,000. $1,000,000 will be paid at closing, with the balance of the purchase price paid out in
accordance with a mutually approved royalty agreement and paid consulting agreement, and $1,000,000 to be paid in stock, cash,
or a combination on a mutually agreed schedule.  

Results
of Operations   

Selling,
General, and Administrative Expenses   

For
the year ended June 30, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses were $719,868 as compared to $358,656 for the year
ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $361,212 or approximately 50%. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 selling, general
and administrative expenses consisted of the following:  

The
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2016, when compared with the prior year, is primarily due
to an increase in salaries related to increased headcount and an increase in accounting expense due to costs associated with bringing
our SEC filings current.  

Changes
in fair value of derivative liabilities results from the changes in the fair value of the derivative liability due to the application
of ASC 815, resulting in either income or expense, depending on the difference in fair value of the derivative liabilities between
their measurement dates. The increase in fair value of derivative liabilities recognized during fiscal 2016 is primarily due to
the increase in the market price of our common stock. The decrease in fair value of derivative liabilities recognized during fiscal
2015 is primarily due to an increase of our common stock quoted price between measurement dates and during such periods, respectively.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense represents the stated interest of notes and convertible notes payable as well as the amortization of debt discount. The
increase in interest expense during fiscal 2016 is primarily due to increased amortization of debt discount of $131,422, along
with an increase in interest-bearing liabilities.  

Derivative
Liability Expense   

During
fiscal 2016, the Company entered into sixteen unsecured convertible promissory note agreements totaling $265,000. These notes
bear interest at rates between 8% and 14%, and are convertible into shares of common stock at a discount rate of 50% of the average
10-day closing bid price of the Company's stock. Derivative liability was recognized at the issuance dates of each note and totaled
$265,000, with a corresponding charge to debt discount of $265,000 and $265,000 to derivative liability expense.   

Gain
on Troubled Debt Restructuring   

During
fiscal 2016, the Company entered transactions with noteholders and other vendors to settle amounts owed through the issuance of
the Company s Series A $0.001 preferred stock. The table below summarizes the shares issued and the gain realized from this
troubled debt restructuring.

Loss
on Settlement of Debt    

On
October 9, 2014, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement with IBC Funds, LLC ( IBC ). This agreement was approved
by the Manatee County, Florida Court on October 10, 2014. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to settle approximately
$259,000 of outstanding liabilities (the  IBC Claim Amount ) by issuing IBC 572,667 shares of its common stock at
a price per share equal to fifty percent of the lowest sales price of the common stock during the fifteen-day trading period preceding
the request of payment. In the event the Company was delinquent on issuance of the Company s shares upon request by IBC,
the discount would be increased by five percent and by an additional five percent for each additional delinquency until all settlement
shares had been received. At no time could IBC and its affiliates collectively own more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of
common stock. During October 2014, IBC paid an aggregate of $66,000 to various Company creditors. On February 12, 2015 IBC issued
a letter of default to the Company. The Company issued to IBC an additional 286,247 common shares valued at $116,874.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

At
June 30, 2016 and 2015, 100% of our total assets consisted of cash.  

We
do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.  

The
objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have ready access to sufficient funds to meet commitments and effectively
implement our growth strategy. Our primary sources are financing activities such as the issuance of notes payable and convertible
notes payable. In the past, we have mostly relied on debt and equity financing to provide for our operating needs.  

We
were unable to generate sufficient funds from operations to fund our ongoing operating requirements through June 30, 2016. As
of September 30, 2016 we had approximately $500 on hand. We may need to raise funds to enhance our working capital and use them
for strategic purposes. If such need arises, we intend to generate proceeds from either debt or equity financing.  

We
intend to finance our operations using a mix of equity and debt financing. We do not anticipate incurring capital expenditures
for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will need to raise approximately $180,000 per year in the near term to finance
the recurring costs of being a publicly-traded company, and $120,000 to implement a plan of operations, with additional funding
necessary to pay our outstanding obligations. In the long-term, we anticipate we will need to raise a substantial amount of capital
to complete an acquisition. We are unable to quantify the resources we will need to successfully complete an acquisition. If these
funds cannot be obtained, we may not be able to consummate an acquisition or merger, and our business may fail as a result.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has used net cash in its operating
activities of approximately $424,300 and $179,000 during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and has a working
capital deficit of approximately $4.6 million and $5.9 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate
profitable operations in the future, once a merger with an operating company is consummated. Management plans may continue to
provide for its capital requirements by issuing additional equity securities and debt and the Company will continue to find possible
acquisition targets. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved,
the Company will have sufficient funds to execute its business plan or generate positive operating results.  

Year
ended June 30, 2016   

Net
cash used in operations in fiscal year 2016 increased by $245,389 or 137% from fiscal year 2015. This cash was obtained through
the sale of $340,000 of convertible promissory notes and the sale of $85,000 of preferred stock.  

Year
ended June 30, 2015   

Net
cash used in operations in fiscal year 2015 increased by $50,029 or 38.8% from fiscal year 2014. This cash was obtained through
the sale of $185,000 of convertible promissory notes.  

The
increase in cash used in operating activities during fiscal 2016, when compared to the prior year period, is primarily due to
an increase in operating expenses during fiscal 2016.  

Capital
Raising Transactions   

Issuance
of Convertible Notes Payable   

We
generated proceeds of $340,000 and $185,000 during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, from the issuance of convertible notes
payable and promissory notes.  

Other
outstanding obligations at June 30, 2016   

Obligations
to ASC Recap    

In
July, 2013, certain of the Company s creditors showed interest in selling their claims against the Company to ASC Recap,
LLC ( ASC ); this group also included both current and past management of the Company. This led to the Company signing
a Liability Purchase Agreement with ASC on July 23, 2013. This Agreement required the Company to issue common shares within five
business days of each purchase at a 25% discount from the market price to ASC in amounts equal to the claims purchased from the
Company s creditors. In addition, under the terms of the Agreement, the Company issued a $25,000 non-interest bearing convertible
promissory note to ASC, as described in Note 4.  

ASC
signed a series of Claim Purchase Agreements with certain creditors of the Company to purchase their claims against the Company
totaling $2,531,565. These claims consisted of notes payable, convertible notes payable, vendor payables and accrued compensation
to the Company s CEO and to a related party. The Claim Purchase Agreements required ASC to settle the creditors  claims
against the Company for a total of $1,305,996. Each Claim Purchase Agreement stipulated that ASC would pay each creditor the agreed-upon
amount in up to twelve (12) monthly installments.  

In
January, 2014, the Company had not issued any shares to ASC as required by the agreement. As a result, ASC filed a complaint in
Leon County, Florida demanding the prescribed issuance of shares from the Company for the purchased claims. A settlement agreement
was reached on February 6, 2014, and on March 12, 2014 ASC Recap filed a motion in Leon County, Florida which forced the Company
to comply. ASC Recap was awarded a $2,531,565 judgement which was to be paid by issuing free trading common stock at a 25% discount
from the market price .  In addition, on May 6, 2014, the Company issued a $125,000 non-interest bearing convertible
promissory note to ASC, as described in Note 4. Between April and June of 2014, the Company issued to ASC 322,220,000 shares of
common stock with an aggregate market value of $365,308, which reduced the recorded liability by $273,981; in July of 2014, the
Company issued 82,980,000 shares of common stock with an aggregate market value of $24,894.  

On
August 13, 2015 ASC Recap, LLC issued the Company a letter of default related to its agreement to settle outstanding liabilities
and related accrued interest and returned approximately $2,373,000 of liabilities to their original holders, which is detailed
in the table at the end of Note 6. These balances reflect the payments made by ASC to creditors prior to the default.  

An
analysis of the settlement liability due to ASC is as follows:  

The
transfer of liability due to ASC Recap consisted of the following:  

Convertible
Notes Payable    

The
Company had convertible promissory notes aggregating approximately $1.6 million and $1.4 million outstanding at June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The accrued interest amounted to approximately $1,037,000 and $754,000 at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Convertible Notes Payable bear interest at rates ranging between 10% and 18% per annum. Interest is generally payable monthly.
The Convertible Notes Payable are generally convertible at rates ranging between $1.875 and $0.75 per share, at the holders 
option. At June 30, 2016, all convertible promissory notes have matured.  

Additionally,
upon conversion, the holders of $192,000 of convertible promissory notes are also entitled to 12,800,000 warrants, exercisable
at a rate of $37.50. The warrants expire 3 years from the date of issuance.  

Notes
Payable    

The
Company had promissory notes aggregating approximately $240,000 at June 30, 2016 and $90,000 at June 30, 2015. The related accrued
interest amounted to approximately $199,590 and $24,500 at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The notes payable bear interest
at rates ranging between 8% and 16% per annum. Interest is generally payable monthly. All promissory notes have matured as of
June 30, 2016.  

Warrants    

As
of June 30, 2016, we had no outstanding warrants.  

Derivative
Liability    

The
Corporation recognizes all derivative financial instruments on its balance sheet at fair value. As of June 30, 2016 the Company
had $452,965 in notes that are convertible into the Company s common stock, and which contained certain ratchet provisions
that reduce the conversion price of the notes. In accordance with ASC 815 the Company determined that the note the conversion
features with provisions that reduce the exercise price of the notes did not qualify for a scope exception under ASC 815 as they
were determined not to be indexed to the Company s stock.  

Derivatives
are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value (see Note 3). These derivatives, including embedded derivatives
in the Company s structured borrowings, are separately valued and accounted for on the Company s balance sheet. Fair
values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily available,
fair values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring judgment
and estimates.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Climate
Change   

Our
opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have,
any material effect on our operations.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
Company s critical accounting policies are as follows:  

Convertible
Instruments - The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance
with ASC 815.  

ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments
and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments in accordance with EITF 00-19. These three criteria include
circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely
related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded
derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting
principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as
the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815
also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional (as that term is described).  

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) in accordance with the provisions of ASC 470 20  Debt with Conversion Options  Accordingly,
the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in
debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the
note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized
over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends
for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of
the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the
note.  

The
Company believes the certain conversion features embedded in convertible notes payable are not clearly and closely related to
the economic characteristics of the Company s stock price. Accordingly, the Company has recognized derivative liabilities
in connection with such instruments. The Company uses judgment in determining the fair value of derivative liabilities at the
date of issuance at every balance sheet thereafter. The Company uses judgment in determining which valuation is most appropriate
for the instrument (e.g., Black Scholes), the expected volatility, the implied risk free interest rate, as well as the expected
dividend rate.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who at June 30, 2016 was also our principal executive and financial
officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that,
as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that material information required
to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated
and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of June 30, 2016. In making this assessment, our management used criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Guidance for Smaller Public Companies.  

During
our assessment of the design and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, management
identified the following material weaknesses:  

While
    we have processes in place, there are no formal written policies and procedures related to certain financial reporting processes;   

There
    is no formal documentation in which management specified financial reporting objectives to enable the identification of risks,
    including fraud risks;   

Our
    Board of Directors consisted of only one member and we lack the resources and personnel to implement proper segregation of
    duties or other risk mitigation systems.   

A
material weakness is  a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that result in more than a
remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
by us in a timely manner.  A significant deficiency, is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control
over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible
for oversight of the registrant s financial reporting.  

We
intend to gradually improve our internal control over financial reporting to the extent that we can allocate resources to such
improvements. We intend to prioritize the design of our internal control over financial reporting starting with our control environment
and risk assessments and ending with control activities, information and communication activities, and monitoring activities.
Although we believe the time to adapt in the next year will help position us to provide improved internal control functions into
the future, in the interim, these changes caused control deficiencies, which in the aggregate resulted in a material weakness.
Due to the existence of these material weaknesses, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2016.  

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit smaller reporting companies to provide only the
management s report in this annual report.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Business
Experience   

Mr.
Kevin Yates has served as Chairman of the Company s Board of Directors since April 2010 and as the Company s Chief
Executive Officer, Treasurer and Secretary since July 2010. Mr. Yates formally served as Chief Operating Officer of the company
in 2006-2007.

the past nine years, Mr. Yates has served as President and Director of PocketMD. Mr. Yates has also served as Director of Mobile
Software Team, LLC from August 2008 through July 2012, and C3I Services, LLC from July 2012 to present.  

Mr.
Yates  devotes approximately 90% of his time to the business and affairs of our company. Mr. Yates experience in working
with public companies  operational strategy and market plan makes him an asset to the Company.  

There
are no family relationships among our directors or executive officers.  

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance   

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that our executive officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered
class of our equity securities file reports of ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or 5 with the SEC. Such
executive officers, directors and ten percent stockholders are also required by the SEC rules to furnish to us copies of all Section
16(a) reports that they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, or written representations
from certain reporting persons that they were not required to file a Form 5, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended June
30, 2013, our executive officers, directors and ten percent stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable
to such persons.  

Code
of Ethics   

We
have adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct to provide guiding principles to our principal executive officer, principal
financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller of our company in the performance of their duties. Our Code
of Ethics and Business Conduct also strongly recommends that all directors and employees of our company comply with the code in
the performance of their duties. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct provides that the basic principle that governs all of
our officers, directors and employees is that our business should be carried on with loyalty to the interest of our stockholders,
customers, suppliers, fellow employees, strategic partners and other business associates. We believe that the philosophy and operating
style of our management are essential to the establishment of a proper corporate environment for the conduct of our business.  

Generally,
our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct provides guidelines regarding:  

conflicts
    of interest,

A

Committees
of the Board of Directors   

Our
Board of Directors has not yet established any committees, including an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee or a Nominating
Committee. We plan to expand our Board in the future and we will seek to establish an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee,
but this will depend on our ability to attract and retain new directors. The typical functions of such committees are currently
being undertaken by the entire Board as a whole. Our Board currently consists of only one member, Mr. Yates.  

Audit
Committee Financial Expert   

Currently
no member of our Board is an audit committee financial expert. We do not currently have the resources to recruit a Board member
who would also be a financial expert. We may start our recruiting process for such Board member during fiscal 2016 if our financial
position improves.

principal executive officer who were serving as executive officers at the end of the last completed fiscal year and whose total
compensation exceeded $100,000; and (iii) up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been provided pursuant
to (ii) above but for the fact that the individual was not serving as our executive officer at the end of the last completed fiscal
year:

Item
13. Certain Relationship and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.   

Other
than compensation arrangements, we describe below, transactions during our last fiscal year, to which we were a party, in which:  

The
    amounts involved exceeded or will exceed the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of our total assets at year-end for the
    last two completed fiscal years; and   

Any
    of our directors, executive officers, or holders of more than 5% of our common stock, or any member of the immediate family
    of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.   

Common
Stock   

During
fiscal 2016 we issued shares of our common stock as follows:  

On
    October 9, 2015, we issued 3,333,333 shares of our common stock, twenty-six shares of Series F preferred stock, with a stated
    value of $5,000 and a par value of $0.001 per share, and three shares of Series H Preferred Stock, with a stated value of
    $1,000 and a par value of $0.001 per share, to the Company s current Chairman of the Board in consideration for his
    forgiveness of $633,000 in accrued compensation. Subsequently, in October 2015, these Series F and Series H preferred shares
    were exchanged for 532,000 shares of Series A preferred stock. Holders of Series A preferred shares are restricted from converting
    their shares to common stock for two years (the  Lock-Up Period ). After the Lock-Up Period, they may convert
    up to one percent of their Series A preferred shares into common shares on a one for one basis each month for four years (the
     Leak-Out Period ). However, the conversion price automatically reduces by 86% to $0.035 per share if our common
    stock is below $0.10 per share. At the end of the Leak-Out Period, up to all of the remaining Series A preferred shares may
    be converted to common stock at the shareholders  discretion.   

Preferred
Stock   

On
    February 18, 2016 a holder of a short term note was issued 220,000 shares of Series A preferred stock valued based on the
    as-converted market price of $22, in exchange for principal in the amount of $100,000, and accrued interest in the amount
    of $103,022. The exchange resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $203,000.   

On
    October 14, 2015 a former Chairman of the Board of the Company was issued 80 shares of Series F preferred stock with a stated
    value of $5,000 and a par value $0.001 per share, and 12 shares of Series H preferred stock, with a stated value of $1,000
    and a par value $0.001 per share in consideration for his forgiveness of $412,000 in accrued compensation, resulting in a
    gain on extinguishment of debt of $396,075. Subsequently, in October 2015, these Series F and Series H shares were exchanged
    for 1,648,000 shares of Series A preferred stock.   

On
    October 28, 2015, preferred shareholders representing a majority of each series of our outstanding preferred stock, voted
    to cancel all their shares of preferred stock in exchange for 11,181,340 shares of newly designated Series A preferred stock.
    The number of shares of newly issued Series A preferred stock issued to each preferred shareholder was calculated by dividing
    the total stated value of their preferred shares by $0.25. The holders of the Series A preferred shares are restricted from
    converting their shares to common stock for two years (the  Lock-Up Period ). After the Lock-Up Period, they may
    convert up to one percent of their Series A preferred shares into common shares on a one for one basis each month for four
    years (the  Leak-Out Period ). However, the conversion price automatically reduces by 86% to $0.035 per share
    if our common stock is below $0.10 per share. At the end of the Leak-Out Period, up to all of the remaining Series A preferred
    shares may be converted to common stock at the shareholders  discretion.   

During
fiscal 2015 we issued shares of our common stock as follows:  

In
    July of 2014, the Company issued 55,320 shares of common stock with an aggregate value of $24,894 to ASC Recap.   

On
    October 9, 2014, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with IBC Funds, LLC ( IBC ). This agreement was approved
    by the Manatee County, Florida Court on October 10, 2014. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to settle
    approximately $259,000 of outstanding liabilities (the  IBC Claim Amount ) by issuing IBC 572,667 shares of its
    common stock at a price per share equal to fifty percent of the lowest sales price of the common stock during the fifteen-day
    trading period preceding the request of payment. In the event the Company was delinquent on issuance of the Company s
    shares upon request by IBC, the discount would be increased by five percent and by an additional five percent for each additional
    delinquency until all settlement shares had been received. At no time could IBC and its affiliates collectively own more than
    4.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock. During October 2014, IBC paid an aggregate of $66,000 to various Company
    creditors. On February 12, 2015 IBC issued a letter of default to the Company. The Company issued to IBC an additional 286,247
    common shares valued at $116,874.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    

To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors  

NuState
Energy Holdings, Inc.  

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements
of operations and changes in stockholders  deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30,
2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NuState
Energy Holdings, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended June 30, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
1 to the financial statements, the Company had a loss from operations of approximately $720,000 and cash used in operations of
approximately $424,000 for the year ended of June 30, 2016. The Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $4,500,000
and an accumulated deficit of approximately $41,541,000 at June 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 1. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

   JUNE
30, 2016 AND 2015   

NOTE
1: ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN   

NuState
Energy Holdings, Inc. ,  or the Company, currently is a Florida corporation that was incorporated in Nevada in October 1987.
It was formerly known as Jaguar Investments, Inc. between October 1987 and May 2003, Power2Ship, Inc. between May 2003 and November
2006, and Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc. between November 2006 and December 2007.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company had a loss from operations of $720,000
and had net cash used in operating activities of approximately $424,000 during the year ended June 30, 2016 and had a working
capital deficit of approximately $4,500,000 and an accumulated deficit of $41,540,000 at June 30, 2016. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising
from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate profitable operations
in the future. Management plans to provide for the Company s capital requirements by continuing to issue additional equity
and debt securities. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved,
the Company will have sufficient funds to execute its business plan or generate positive operating results. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

NOTE
2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reporting amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported period. Actual results will differ from those estimates. Included in these estimates are assumptions used
in Black-Scholes-Merton derivative liability valuation methods, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected
dividend rate and in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid, temporary, cash equivalents with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased,
to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.   

Concentration
of Credit Risks   

The
Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk from cash.  

The
Company s cash account is held at a financial institution and is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or
FDIC, up to $250,000. During the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had not reached a bank balance exceeding the
FDIC insurance limit.  

Derivative
Liabilities   

The
Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, which consist of convertible
instruments and rights to shares of the Company s common stock, and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for
liability classification under ASC 815.  

ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments
and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)
the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic
characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument
and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with
changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative
instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception
to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.

TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   JUNE

NOTE
2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued   

During
the year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had notes payable outstanding in which the conversion rate was variable and
undeterminable. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a derivative liability in connection with such instruments. The Company
uses judgment in determining the fair value of derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and at every balance sheet thereafter
and in determining which valuation method is most appropriate for the instrument (e.g., Black-Scholes-Merton), the expected volatility,
the implied risk free interest rate, as well as the expected dividend rate, if any.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company accounts for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing
generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.  

ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:  

Level 1:
      
      Observable
    inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2:   
      Observable
    market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.   

Level 3:   
      Unobservable
    inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions.   

The
Company s derivative liability is classified as Level 3 financial instrument.  

Additional
Disclosures Regarding Fair Value Measurements   

The
carrying value of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued compensation, notes payable and convertible promissory
notes payable, approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these items or the use of market interest rates.  

Convertible
Instruments   

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) in accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Accordingly, the Company records,
when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based
upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and
the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the
related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion
options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment
date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note.  

ASC
815-40, Contracts in Entity s own Equity, generally provides that, among other things, if an event is not within the entity s
control, such contract could require net cash settlement and shall be classified as an asset or a liability.  

The
Company determines whether the instruments issued in the transactions are considered indexed to the Company s own stock.
During fiscal years 2014 the Company s issued convertible securities with variable conversion provisions that resulted in
derivative liabilities.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Income Taxes,  which requires,
among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires
the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred
tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.  

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions . When tax returns are
filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others
are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the
period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset
or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the
largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing
authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above
should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest
and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all
highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.

Income
Taxes, continued   

The
Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25,    Definition of Settlement  ,  which provides guidance on how an entity
should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits
and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without
being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax
benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical
merits and the statute of limitations remains open. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had not filed tax returns for the tax years
ending June 30, 2008 through 2015 and such returns, when filed, potentially will be subject to audit by the taxing authorities
for a minimum of three years beyond the filing date under the three-year statute of limitations. The Company has not accrued any
potential tax penalties associated with not filing these tax returns. Due to recurring losses, management believes such potential
tax penalties, if any, would not be material in amount.  

Share-Based
Payments   

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718,  Compensation - Stock Compensation .
Under the fair value recognition provisions of this topic, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on
the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which
is the vesting period.  

The
Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton, or BSM, option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its options, which
incorporates various subjective assumptions including volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividend yield to
calculate the fair value of stock option awards. Compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations is based on awards
ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant
and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  

Segment
Reporting   

The
Company operates in one business segment which technologies are providing pertinent, real-time information to the worldwide transportation
and security industries.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Recent
accounting pronouncements have been issued but deemed by management to be outside the scope of relevance to the Company.  

As
an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the exemption provided for in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act or JOBS
Act allowing us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and
private companies until those standards apply to private companies pursuant to Section 102(b)(1) of the Act.  

Basic
and Diluted Earnings Per Share   

Basic
earnings per share are calculated by dividing income available to stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of Common
Stock and the dilutive Common Stock share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive Common Stock share equivalents consist
of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants (calculated using the modified-treasury stock method) and conversion
of other securities such as convertible debt or convertible preferred stock. Potential common shares includable in the computation
of fully-diluted per-share results are not presented in the financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016, as their effect
would be anti-dilutive. Share amounts reflect the 1500:1 reverse stock split which was effective as of June 16, 2016.

NOTE
5: OBLIGATIONS TO ASC RECAP, LLC   

In
July, 2013, certain of the Company s creditors showed interest in selling their claims against the Company to ASC Recap,
LLC ( ASC ); this group also included both current and past management of the Company. This led to the Company signing
a Liability Purchase Agreement with ASC on July 23, 2013. This Agreement required the Company to issue common shares within five
business days of each purchase at a 25% discount from the market price to ASC in amounts equal to the claims purchased from the
Company s creditors. In addition, under the terms of the Agreement, the Company issued a $25,000 non-interest bearing convertible
promissory note to ASC, as described in Note 4.  

ASC
signed a series of Claim Purchase Agreements with certain creditors of the Company to purchase their claims against the Company
totaling $2,531,565. These claims consisted of notes payable, convertible notes payable, vendor payables and accrued compensation
to the Company s CEO and to a related party. The Claim Purchase Agreements required ASC to settle the creditors  claims
against the Company for a total of $1,305,996. Each Claim Purchase Agreement stipulated that ASC would pay each creditor the agreed-upon
amount in up to twelve (12) monthly installments.  

In
January, 2014, the Company had not issued any shares to ASC as required by the agreement. As a result, ASC filed a complaint in
Leon County, Florida demanding the prescribed issuance of shares from the Company for the purchased claims. A settlement agreement
was reached on February 6, 2014, and on March 12, 2014 ASC Recap filed a motion in Leon County, Florida which forced the Company
to comply. ASC Recap was awarded a $2,531,565 judgement which was to be paid by issuing free trading common stock at a 25% discount
from the market price .  In addition, on May 6, 2014, the Company issued a $125,000 non-interest bearing convertible
promissory note to ASC, as described in Note 4. Between April and June of 2014, the Company issued to ASC 322,220,000 shares of
common stock with an aggregate market value of $365,308, which reduced the recorded liability by $273,981; in July of 2014, the
Company issued 82,980,000 shares of common stock with an aggregate market value of $24,894 (see Note 6).  

An
analysis of the settlement liability due to ASC is as follows:

The
Company ceased issuing shares upon discovering that ASC had failed to make its first payment to the creditors on time, did not
give verifiable reports to the creditors, or make regular monthly payments as specified in the Claim Purchase Agreement. A provision
in each Claim Purchase Agreement stipulated that the  Purchaser (ASC) shall not be obligated to pay any portion of the purchase
price in the event of a Default by the Company.  On August 13, 2015 ASC served the Company with a Notice of Default, which
per the Agreement, returns the unpaid balance owed to the creditors of the Company.  

NOTE
6: SETTLEMENT WITH IBC FUNDS, LLC   

On
October 9, 2014, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with IBC Funds, LLC ( IBC ). This agreement was approved by
the Manatee County, Florida Court on October 10, 2014. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to settle approximately
$259,000 of outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses (the  IBC Claim Amount ) by issuing IBC 858,814 shares
of its common stock at a price per share equal to fifty percent of the lowest sales price of the common stock during the fifteen-day
trading period preceding the request of payment. In the event the Company was delinquent on issuance of the Company s shares
upon request by IBC, the discount would be increased by five percent and by an additional five percent for each additional delinquency
until all settlement shares had been received. At no time could IBC and its affiliates collectively own more than 4.99% of the
outstanding shares of common stock. During October 2014, IBC paid an aggregate of $66,000 to various Company creditors. On February
12, 2015 IBC issued a letter of default to the Company.

A
summary of the issuance of shares of Common Stock, related consideration and fair value of transaction, for the year ended June
30, 2015 was as follows:  

Issuances
of Common Stock During 2016   

During
fiscal 2016 we issued shares of our common stock as follows:  

On
    October 14, 2015, Ms. Roberton was issued 332,667 shares of common stock valued at $49,900, or $0.15 per share as a performance
    bonus pursuant to her employment agreement.   

On
    October 9, 2015, we issued 3,333,333 shares of our common stock, twenty-six shares of Series F preferred stock, with a stated
    value of $5,000 and a par value of $0.001 per share, and three shares of Series H Preferred Stock, with a stated value of
    $1,000 and a par value of $0.001 per share, to the Company s current Chairman of the Board in consideration for his
    forgiveness of $633,000 in accrued compensation. Subsequently, in October 2015, these Series F and Series H preferred shares
    were exchanged for 532,000 shares of Series A preferred stock.  Holders of Series A preferred shares are restricted
    from converting their shares to common stock for two years (the  Lock-Up Period ).  After
    the Lock-Up Period, they may convert  up to one percent of their Series A preferred shares into common shares on a one
    for one basis each month for four years (the  Leak-Out Period ). However, the conversion price automatically reduces
    by 86% to $0.035 per share i f our common stock is below $0.10 per share.  At the
    end of the Leak-Out Period, up to all of the remaining Series A preferred shares may be converted to common stock at the shareholders 
    discretion.   

Preferred
Stock   

Series
A and B issued and outstanding shares of the Company s preferred stock have a par value of $0.001. The Companies preferred
shares Series C, D, F, H. I. J. and Y were exchanged for shares of Series A preferred stock in November, 2015. These classes of
shares were subsequently cancelled. Issued and outstanding shares of Series C, D, F, H. I. J. and Y of the Company s preferred
stock had a par value of $0.01 per share. All classes rank(ed) prior to any class or series of the Company s common stock
as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or as to the payment of dividends.
All preferred stock shall have no voting rights except if the subject of such vote would reduce the amount payable to the holders
of preferred stock upon liquidation or dissolution of the company and cancel and modify the conversion rights of the holders of
preferred stock as defined in the certificate of designations of the respective series of preferred stock.  

On
October 14, 2015 a former Chairman of the Board of the Company was issued 80 shares of Series F preferred stock with a stated
value of $5,000 and a par value $0.001 per share, and 12 shares of Series H preferred stock, with a stated value of $1,000 and
a par value $0.001 per share in consideration for his forgiveness of $412,000 in accrued compensation. Subsequently, in October
2015, these Series F and Series H shares were exchanged for 1,648,000 shares of Series A preferred stock.  

On
October 28, 2015, preferred shareholders representing a majority of each series of our outstanding preferred stock, voted to cancel
all their shares of preferred stock in exchange for 11,181,340 shares of newly designated Series A preferred stock. The number
of shares of newly issued Series A preferred stock issued to each preferred shareholder was calculated by dividing the total stated
value of their preferred shares by $0.25. The holders of the Series A preferred shares are restricted from converting their shares
to common stock for two years (the  Lock-Up Period ). After the Lock-Up Period, they may convert up to one percent
of their Series A preferred shares into common shares on a one for one basis each month for four years (the  Leak-Out Period ).
However, the conversion price automatically reduces by 86% to $0.035 per share if our common stock is below $0.10 per share. At
the end of the Leak-Out Period, up to all of the remaining Series A preferred shares may be converted to common stock at the shareholders 
discretion.  

On
October 28, 2015 the 87,000 shares of Series Y preferred stock, owned by the Company s former Chairman of the Board, were
exchanged for 87,000 shares of Series A preferred stock. These shares of Series A preferred stock were valued at their fair market
value of $8.70.  

In
November, 2015, we sold 40,000 shares of Series A preferred stock to one investor for $10,000 and sold 100,000 shares of Series
B preferred stock to another investor for $25,000.  

See
Note 5 for Series B preferred stock issued in exchange for convertible notes payable and accrued interest.  

Series
A Preferred Stock

Options   

In
January 2001, The Company adopted the 2001 Employee Compensation Plan, or the Plan. The Plan provided for stock compensation through
awards of shares of the Company s common stock.  

The
Company s board of directors may appoint a Compensation Committee to administer the Plan. In the absence of such appointment,
the board of directors is responsible for the administration of the Plan. The Company did not appoint a Compensation Committee
to administer the Plan. The board of directors has the sole power to award shares of common stock under the Plan, as well as determine
those individuals eligible to receive an award of Plan shares. Awards of shares under the Plan may be made as compensation for
services rendered, directly or in lieu of other compensation payable, as a bonus in recognition of past services or performance
or may be sold to an employee.  

The
maximum number of shares which may be awarded under the plan is 5,000,000. Awards were generally granted to:  

executive
    officers, officers and directors (including advisory and other special directors) of the Company;   

full-time
    and part-time employees of the Company;   

natural
    persons engaged by the Company as consultants, advisors or agents; and   

a
    lawyer, law firm, accountant or accounting firm, or other professional or professional firm engaged by the Company.   

Grants
to employees may be made for cash, property, services rendered or other forms of payment constituting lawful consideration under
applicable law. Shares awarded, other than for services rendered, may not be sold at less than the fair value of our common stock
on the date of grant.  

The
plan terminated in January 2011. The board of directors has absolute discretion to amend the plan with the exception that the
board had no authority to extend the term of the plan, to increase the number of shares subject to award under the plan or to
amend the definition of  Employee  under the plan.  

The
Company generally recognizes its share-based payments over the vesting period for which such payments are made.  

The
Company had no outstanding options or option activity between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2016  

The
total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized amounted to $0 at June 30, 2016 and 2015. There was no
intrinsic value as of June 30, 2016. The Company s policy is to issue shares pursuant to the exercise of stock options from
its available authorized but unissued shares of common stock. It does not issue shares pursuant to the exercise of stock options
from its treasury shares.

NOTE
8: INCOME TAXES   

The
Company has not filed its corporate tax returns since fiscal 2007.  

Due
to recurring losses, the Company s tax provision for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.  

A
summary of our deferred tax is as follows:  

As
of June 30, 2016, the Company had unused net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $26.9 million available to reduce
future federal taxable income. Net operating loss carryforwards expire through fiscal years ending 2036. During the year ended
June 30, 2016 the Company utilized net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $866,000 to reduce current taxable income.
Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carryforwards after
a change in control (generally a greater than 50% change in ownership).  

The
Company s ability to offset future taxable income, if any, with tax net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due
to the non-filing of tax returns and the impact of the statute of limitations on the Company s ability to claim such benefits.
Furthermore, changes in ownership may result in limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Due to these limitations,
and other considerations, management has established full valuation allowances on deferred tax assets relating to net operating
loss carryforward, as the realization of any future benefits from these assets is uncertain.  

The
valuation allowance at June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $10,364,300 and $10,698,000, respectively. The change in the valuation allowance
during the year ended June 30, 2016 was a decrease of approximately $334,000. The change in the valuation allowance during the
year ended June 30, 2015 was an increase of $222,000.  

The
table below summarizes the differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate as follows for fiscal 2016
and 2015. The effective tax rate is 35% Federal and 3.6% for State after Federal income tax (benefit):  

NOTE
9: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

During
fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred expenses of $97,841 and $110,400, respectively, to a related party by means of common
ownership and management with the Company as compensation to our Chairman of the Board and Chief Financial Officer.
