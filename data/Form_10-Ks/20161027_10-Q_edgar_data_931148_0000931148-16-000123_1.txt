    Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     A. Organization 
  GrafTech International Ltd. (the "Company") is one of the world s largest manufacturers and providers of high quality synthetic and natural graphite and carbon based products. References herein to  GTI,   we,   our,  or  us  refer collectively to GrafTech International Ltd. and its subsidiaries. We have   seven   major product categories: graphite electrodes, refractory products, needle coke products, advanced electronics technologies, advanced graphite materials, advanced composite materials and advanced materials.   
  On February 26, 2016,  the Company announced it plans to realign its   two   business segments.  Industrial Materials will now be comprised of graphite electrodes and needle coke products. Engineered Solutions will now be comprised of advanced graphite materials, advanced composite materials, advanced electronic technologies, and refractory products. Refractory products was previously included in the Industrial Materials business segment.  Advanced materials products will now be a part of the business segment where these products are produced.  
  This realignment of the business segments will allow the Company to better direct its resources and simplify its operations.  The Industrial Materials business segment will continue to focus on being the lowest cost producer providing the best quality of graphite electrodes in a very challenging market.  The Engineered Solutions business segment will continue to leverage the intellectual property of carbon and graphite material science to innovate and commercialize advanced technologies and new products in high growth markets.   
  The Company also announced that it plans to review strategic alternatives for its Engineered Solutions business segment.  This process is currently under way.  See  Note 3 "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale" for further information. 
  B. Basis of Presentation 
  The interim Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, they have been prepared in accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The   December 31, 2015   financial position data included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  Annual Report ) but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP in audited financial statements. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes, contained in the Annual Report. 
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (all of which are of a normal, recurring nature) which management considers necessary for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results which may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year.  
  C. Predecessor and Successor Reporting 
  On August 17, 2015, the Company was acquired by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (see Note 2 "  Preferred Share Issuance and Merger  ").  We elected to account for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting.  Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of GTI were adjusted to their fair market value as of August 15, 2015, the day that Brookfield effectively took control of the Company.   
  Our consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the acquisition include amortization expense relating to the fair value adjustments and depreciation expense based on the fair value of the Company's property, plant and equipment that had previously been carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.  Therefore, the Company's financial information prior to the acquisition is not comparable to the financial information subsequent to the Merger.  As a result, the financial statements and certain note presentations are separated into two distinct periods, the period before the consummation of the acquisition (labeled "Predecessor") and the period after the date of acquisition (labeled "Successor"), to indicate the application of the different basis of accounting between the periods presented.

D. New Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605 Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. This ASU requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU was expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-3,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability.  The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. We had   no   capitalized debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2015.  We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2016, and adoption resulted in no significant impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under this new guidance, a company will now recognize most leases on its balance sheet as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after Decemeber 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
           (2) 
    Preferred Share Issuance and Merger    
     Preferred Stock 
  On August 11, 2015, the Company issued and sold to BCP IV GrafTech Holdings LP ("BCP"), an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ( Brookfield ) (i)   136,616   shares of a new Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value   $0.01   per share (the  Series A Preferred Stock ), convertible into   19.9%   of the shares of common stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such issuance and (ii)   13,384   shares of a new Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value   $0.01   per share (the  Series B Preferred Stock,  and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the  Preferred Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of   $150,000,000   in cash (the  Purchase Price ), under the Investment Agreement dated May 4, 2015 (the  Investment Agreement ) between the Company and Brookfield. 
  The closing of such issuance and sale occurred after the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the Investment Agreement. 
  Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Company reimbursed Brookfield for   $500,000   of out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) incurred by Brookfield in connection with the transaction. 
  The proceeds from the issuance and sale were used by the Company, along with funds available under the Company s   $40 million   delayed draw term loan facility, senior revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to prepay the Company s   $200 million   Senior Subordinated Notes due November 30, 2015. 
  Merger Agreement 
  On May 18, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ), dated May 17, 2015, with BCP and Athena Acquisition Subsidiary Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of BCP ( Acquisition Sub ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 26, 2015, BCP commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value   $0.01   per share (the  Shares ), of the Company, at a purchase price of   $5.05   per Share in cash (the  Offer Price ), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated May 26, 2015 (together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the  Offer to Purchase ) and in the related Letter of Transmittal (the  Letter of Transmittal  and, together with the Offer to Purchase, the  Offer ). 
  On August 14, 2015, Acquisition Sub accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer, and payment of the Offer Price for such Shares was made promptly.  On August 17, 2015, Acquisition Sub merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of BCP (the "Merger").

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, each Share that was not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than canceled shares, dissenting shares and shares held by the Company s subsidiaries or BCP s subsidiaries (other than Acquisition Sub)) was canceled and converted into cash consideration in an amount equal to the Offer Price. 
  Business Combination 
  The computation of the fair value of the total consideration at the date of acquisition follows: 

Recording of assets acquired and liabilities assumed:   The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are assigned a new basis of accounting reflecting their estimated fair values. The information included herein has been prepared based on the allocation of purchase price using estimates of the fair values and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the best available information determined with the assistance of independent valuations, quoted market prices and management estimates. 
  The following table summarizes the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:

Goodwill:   Goodwill of approximately   $173.1 million   was recognized for the acquisition and is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.   Goodwill was  increased by   $1.1 million   in March 2016, as a result of a decreased inventory valuation of   $2.0 million   offset by an increase to deferred tax assets of $0.9 million. 
   
           (3) 
    Discontinued Operations and Related Assets Held for Sale 
     On February 26, 2016, the Company announced that it had initiated a strategic review of its Engineered Solutions business segment  to better direct its resources and simplify its operations.  Any potential sale of assets was prohibited by the Revolving Facility without approval of the requisite lenders thereunder.  On April 27, 2016, GrafTech and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment to the Revolving Facility (see Note 8 "Debt and Liquidity") which, among other things, permits the sale of assets with the restriction that the proceeds be utilized to pay down revolver borrowings.  As of June 30, 2016, the Engineered Solutions segment qualified for reporting as discontinued operations as we expect the divestiture to be complete within 12 months of the qualification. 
  During the second quarter, we evaluated the fair value of the Engineered Solutions business segment utilizing the market approach (Level 3 measure).  As a result, we incurred an impairment charge to our Engineered Solutions business segment of   $105.6 million   to align the carrying value with estimated fair value. The analysis was updated as of   September 30,     2016  , and did not result in further adjustment. The estimate reflects Management s view of the manner in which the Engineered Solutions business will be divested, including  assumptions as to if and how it will be split, given the lines of business and asset groups that constitute the Engineered Solutions segment.  Amongst other things, the split into groups influences the computation of the impairment charge.     The impairment charge and resulting loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is not offset by expected gains on certain group(s), and as a result may or may not later be partially offset through gains depending on the outcome of the divestiture.  These assumptions and estimates are subject to change until divestiture is completed and may be adjusted in the quarter that the information becomes available.

    Rationalizations 
     Throughout 2013, 2014 and 2015 the Company undertook rationalization plans in order to streamline its organization and lower its production costs.   The majority of these initiatives were substantially complete as of   September 30,     2016  .  The rationalization liability as of   September 30,     2016   was   $0.2 million   consisting of the plan described below and severance payouts related to prior rationalization plans.  In June of 2016, we further impaired assets related to our South African facility by   $0.6 million   to reflect a decline in market value. 
  2015 Advanced Graphite Materials Rationalization 
  On March 2, 2015, GrafTech announced plans to further optimize the production platform for its advanced graphite materials business.  These actions included the closure of our Notre Dame, France facility and further reductions in force in our Columbia, Tennessee facility and other locations totaling approximately   85   people.  The 2015 Advanced Graphite Materials rationalization plan will result in approximately   $10 million   of charges consisting of severance, inventory losses and other related costs.  Approximately   $8 million   of these costs were to be cash outlays, the majority of which were disbursed in 2015.  We incurred rationalization and related charges of   $0.8 million   in the period July 1 through August 14, 2015,   $6.6 million   in the period January 1 through August 14, 2015 and   $1.3 million   in the period August 15 through    September 30, 2015  .  We incurred insignificant charges for this plan during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016  . The remaining liability associated with this plan is   $0.6 million   as of   September 30,     2016  . 
   
           (5) 
    Segment Reporting 
       
  We operate   two   reportable business segments: Industrial Materials and Engineered Solutions.  On February 26, 2016,  the Company announced plans to realign its business segments (see Note 1A "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies").  As a result of this realignment, our refractory product line was moved from the Industrial Materials business segment to the Engineered Solutions business segment.  Additionally, advanced materials products will now be a part of the business segment where these products are produced.  All prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change.  Our business segments now consist of the following: 
  Industrial Materials.    Our Industrial Materials segment manufactures and delivers high quality graphite electrodes and needle coke products. Electrodes are key components of the conductive power systems used to produce steel and other non-ferrous metals. Needle coke, a crystalline form of carbon derived from decant oil, is the key ingredient in, and is used primarily in, the production of graphite electrodes. 
  Engineered Solutions.     The Engineered Solutions segment includes advanced electronics technologies, advanced graphite materials, advanced composite materials and refractory products. Advanced electronics technologies products consist of electronic thermal management solutions, fuel cell components and sealing materials.  Advanced graphite materials are highly engineered synthetic graphite products used in many areas due to their unique properties and the ability to tailor them to specific solutions. These products are used in transportation, alternative energy, metallurgical, chemical, oil and gas exploration and various other industries.  Advanced composite materials are highly engineered carbon products that are woven into various shapes primarily to support the aerospace and defense industries.  Refractory products are used in blast furnaces and submerged arc furnaces due to their high thermal conductivity and the ease with which they can be machined to large or complex shapes. During the second quarter of 2016, our Engineered Solutions segment qualified as held for sale status and as such our Engineered Solution's results have been excluded from continuing operations.  See Note 3 "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale" for significant components of the results of our Engineered Solutions segment.

    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
     We are required to review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment.  Goodwill impairment is tested at the reporting unit level (for example, graphite electrodes, needle coke, etc.) on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 
  We received notice in March 2015 that the market prices for needle coke were decreasing by an additional   18%  , effective for the second quarter of 2015.  This decline further compressed our margins for needle coke products versus our annual plan. We determined that this change, which was driven by overcapacity in the market, indicated that the needle coke industry is facing a deeper and longer trough than previously expected. We considered the additional price change as a triggering event and tested our needle coke goodwill for impairment as of March 31, 2015.  This test resulted in an impairment charge for the remaining needle coke goodwill of   $35.4 million  .  
  As a result of our acquisition by Brookfield, our goodwill and intangibles were revalued as of August 15, 2015.  See Note 2 "Preferred Share Issuance and Merger" for description of the Merger and the results of purchase price accounting.  The following tables represents the changes in the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles during the predecessor entity period of January 1, 2015 through August 14, 2015 and the successor entity period of August 15, 2015 through   September 30,     2016  :

    Debt and Liquidity 
     The following table presents our long-term debt:  

The fair value of debt, which was determined using Level 2 inputs, was   $328.7 million   versus a book value of   $370.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  As a result of our acquisition by Brookfield and the resulting purchase price accounting adjustments (see Note 2 "Preferred Share Issuance and Merger"), our Senior Notes were adjusted to their fair market value as of August 15, 2015.  The discount to fair value will be accreted over the remaining term of the Notes. 
  Credit Facility 
  On April 23, 2014, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a borrowing capacity of   $400 million   and a maturity date of April 2019 (the "Revolving Facility").  On February 27, 2015, GrafTech and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a further Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that provides for, among other things, greater financial flexibility and a   $40 million   senior secured delayed draw term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility").  
  On July 28, 2015, GrafTech and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to change the terms regarding the occurrence of a default upon a change in control (which is defined thereunder to include the acquisition by any person of more than   25   percent of GrafTech s outstanding shares) to exclude the acquisition of shares by Brookfield (see Note 2).  In addition, effective upon such acquisition, the financial covenants were eased, resulting in increased availability under the Revolving Facility.  The size of the Revolving Facility was also reduced from   $400 million   to   $375 million  . The size of the Term Loan Facility remained at   $40 million  . 
  On   April 27, 2016  , GrafTech and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment to the Revolving Facility. The size of the Revolving Facility was permanently reduced from   $375 million   to   $225 million  . New covenants were also added to the Revolving Facility, including a requirement to make mandatory repayments of outstanding amounts under the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility with the proceeds of any sale of all or any substantial part of the assets included in the Engineered Solutions segment and a requirement to maintain minimum liquidity (consisting of domestic cash, cash equivalents and availability under the Revolving Facility) in excess of   $25 million  . The covenants were also modified to provide for:  the elimination of certain exceptions to the Company s negative covenants limiting the Company s ability to make certain investments, sell assets, make restricted payments, incur liens and incur debt; a restriction on the amount of cash and cash equivalents permitted to be held on the balance sheet at any one time without paying down the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility; and changes to the Company s financial covenants so that until the earlier of March 31, 2019 or the Company has   $75 million   in trailing twelve month EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Facility), the Company is required to maintain trailing twelve month EBITDA above certain minimums ranging from (  $40 million  ) to   $35 million   after which the Company s existing financial covenants under the Revolving Facility will apply.

With this amendment, the Company has full access to the   $225 million   Revolving Facility, subject to the $25 million minimum liquidity requirement.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $61.5 million   of borrowings on the Revolving Facility and   $13.9 million   of letters of credit drawn against the Revolving Facility.  
  The   $40 million   Term Loan Facility was fully drawn on August 11, 2015, in connection with the repayment of the Senior Subordinated Notes. The balance of the Term Loan Facility was   $36.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The interest rate applicable to the Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility is LIBOR plus a margin ranging from   2.25%   to   4.75%   (depending on our total senior secured leverage ratio). The borrowers pay a per annum fee ranging from   0.35%   to   0.70%   (depending on our senior secured leverage ratio) on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the Revolving Facility.  
    Senior Notes 
  On November 20, 2012, the Company issued $  300 million   principal amount of   6.375%   Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee certain other indebtedness of the Company or another guarantor.  
    
  The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of   6.375%   per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The Senior Notes mature on November 15, 2020. 
    
  The Company is entitled to redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time on or after November 15, 2016, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture. In addition, prior to November 15, 2016, the Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a price equal to   100%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a  make whole  premium determined as set forth in the indenture.  
    
  The indenture for the Senior Notes states that if, prior to maturity, a change in control (as defined in the indenture) of the Company occurs and thereafter certain downgrades of the ratings of the Senior Notes as specified in the indenture occur, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase any or all of the Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. On August 17, 2015, a change in control occurred due to the Merger (see Note 2 to the Financial Statements). However, the downgrade of the ratings of the Senior Notes, as specified in the indenture, did not occur. Therefore, the Company was not and will not be required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of the Merger. 
    
  The indenture for the Senior Notes also contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to: (i) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; (ii) engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge, consolidate or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of their assets.  
    
  The indenture for the Senior Notes also contains customary events of default, including (i) failure to pay principal or interest on the Senior Notes when due and payable, (ii) failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the indenture or the Senior Notes which failures are not cured or waived as provided in the indenture, (iii) failure to pay indebtedness of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or Significant Subsidiary (each, as defined in the indenture) within any applicable grace period after maturity or acceleration and the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $  50.0 million  , (iv) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization, (v) failure to pay any judgment or decree for an amount in excess of $  50.0 million   against the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary that is not discharged, waived or stayed as provided in the indenture, (vi) cessation of any Subsidiary Guarantee (as defined in the indenture) to be in full force and effect or denial or disaffirmance by any subsidiary guarantor of its obligations under its subsidiary guarantee, and (vii) a default under the Company's Senior Subordinated Notes. In the case of an event of default, the principal amount of the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated.

Interest Rates 
  The Revolving Facility had an effective interest rate of   2.68%   and   5.28%   as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The Term Loan Facility had an interest rate of   2.49%   as of December 31, 2015 and   5.28%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Senior Notes have a fixed interest rate of   6.375%  .  
   
   Legal Proceedings 
  We are involved in various investigations, lawsuits, claims, demands, environmental compliance programs and other legal proceedings arising out of or incidental to the conduct of our business. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these matters, we do not believe that their ultimate disposition will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Product Warranties 
  We generally sell products with a limited warranty. We accrue for known warranty claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We also accrue for estimated warranty claims incurred based on a historical claims charge analysis. Claims accrued but not yet paid and the related activity within the accrual for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , are presented below:  

We compute and apply to ordinary income an estimated annual effective tax rate on a quarterly basis based on current and forecasted business levels and activities, including the mix of domestic and foreign results and enacted tax laws. The estimated annual effective tax rate is updated quarterly based on actual results and updated operating forecasts. Ordinary income refers to income (loss) before income tax expense excluding significant, unusual, or infrequently occurring items. The tax effect of an unusual or infrequently occurring item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs as a discrete item of tax.

The following tables summarize the provision for income taxes for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  : 

For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to recent losses in foreign jurisdictions where a tax benefit will be recognized, offset by recent losses in the U.S. and Switzerland where we receive no tax benefit due to a full valuation allowance and worldwide earnings from various countries taxed at different rates. The recognition of the valuation allowance does not result in or limit the Company's ability to utilize these tax assets in the future. The effective tax rate for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   differs from the U.S. statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to recent losses in the U.S. and Switzerland where we receive no tax benefit due to a full valuation allowance and worldwide earnings from various countries taxed at different rates. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had unrecognized tax benefits of   $3.6 million  ,   $3.1 million   of which, if recognized, would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate.   
  We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. All U.S. federal tax years prior to 2013 are generally closed by statute or have been audited and settled with the applicable domestic tax authorities. All other jurisdictions are still open to examination beginning after 2009. 
    
  We continue to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets based on determinations of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income. Appropriate consideration is given to all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Examples of positive evidence would include a strong earnings history, an event or events that would increase our taxable income through a continued reduction of expenses, and tax planning strategies that would indicate an ability to realize deferred tax assets. In circumstances where the significant positive evidence does not outweigh the negative evidence in regards to whether or not a valuation allowance is required, we have established and maintained valuation allowances on those net deferred tax assets.  
   
           (13) 
     Derivative Instruments 
     We use derivative instruments as part of our overall foreign currency and commodity risk management strategies to manage the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the value of our foreign cash flows and to minimize commodity price volatility. Foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the value of sales made and costs incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Certain of our derivative contracts contain provisions that require us to provide collateral. Since the counterparties to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions, we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk. We do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counter-parties to our instruments.  Our derivative risk management strategy has not resulted in a material impact to our financial results in 2015 or 2016.  Our derivative assets and liabilities are included within "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" and "Other current liabilities" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and effects of these derivatives are recorded in revenue, cost of goods sold and other expense (income) on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Foreign currency derivatives 
  We enter into foreign currency derivatives from time to time to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. These foreign currency instruments, which include, but are not limited to, forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options, attempt to hedge global currency exposures such as foreign currency denominated debt, sales, receivables, payables, and purchases. Forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate. There was no ineffectiveness on these contracts designated as hedging instruments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016  , respectively. 
  In   2015   and   2016  , we entered into foreign currency derivatives denominated in the Mexican peso, South African rand, Brazilian real, euro and Japanese yen. These derivatives were entered into to protect the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from commercial and business transactions may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso, euro and Japanese yen.    As of September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding Mexican peso, euro, and Japanese yen currency contracts with an aggregate notional amount of   $23.1 million  . The foreign currency derivatives outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , have maturities that range from   October, 2016   to   December,  2016  . 
  Commodity derivative contracts 
  We periodically enter into derivative contracts for certain refined oil products and natural gas. These contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that eventual cash flows related to these products may be adversely affected by future changes in prices.    As of September 30, 2016  , we had no outstanding derivative swap contracts for refined oil products or natural gas. 
  Net Investment Hedges 
  We use certain intercompany debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in our foreign operations against currency exposure (net investment hedge). Intercompany debt denominated in foreign currency and designated as a non-derivative net investment hedging instrument was   $11.8 million   and   $13.3 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Within the currency translation adjustment portion of other comprehensive income, we recorded a gain of   $1.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , and we incurred   $0.9 million   loss in three months ended   September 30, 2016  , resulting from these net investment hedges.  We recorded a gain of $2.6 million in the    nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and a loss of   $1.5 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   within other comprehensive income related to theses hedges. 
   
           (14) 
    Guarantor Information 
       
  On November 20, 2012, GrafTech International Ltd. (the  Parent ) issued   $300 million   aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes mature on November 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of   6.375%   per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The Senior Notes have been guaranteed on a senior basis by the following wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Parent: GrafTech Finance Inc., GrafTech Holdings Inc., GrafTech USA LLC, Seadrift Coke LLP, Fiber Materials, Inc., Intermat, GrafTech Global Enterprises Inc., GrafTech International Holdings Inc., GrafTech DE LLC, GrafTech Seadrift Holding Corp, GrafTech International Trading Inc., GrafTech Technology LLC, GrafTech NY Inc., and Graphite Electrode Network LLC. 
  The guarantors of the Senior Notes, solely in their respective capacities as such, are collectively called the  Guarantors.  Our other subsidiaries, which are not guarantors of  the Senior Notes, are called the  Non-Guarantors.

    PART I (CONT'D)

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

All of the guarantees are unsecured. All of the guarantees are full, unconditional (subject to limited exceptions described below) and joint and several.  Each of the Guarantors are 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by the Parent. All of the guarantees of the Senior Notes continue until the Senior Notes have been paid in full, and payment under such guarantees could be required immediately upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Notes. If a Guarantor makes a payment under its guarantee of the Senior Notes, it would have the right under certain circumstances to seek contribution from the other Guarantors. 
  The Guarantors will be released from the guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events, including the following:  the unconditional release or discharge of any guarantee or indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the guarantee of the Senior Notes by such Guarantor; the sale or other disposition, including by way of merger or consolidation or the sale of its capital stock, following which such Guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the Parent; or the Parent's exercise of its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option as described in the indenture applicable to the Senior Notes.  If any Guarantor is released, no holder of the Senior Notes will have a claim as a creditor against such Guarantor.  The indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, of each Guarantor are effectively senior to the claim of any holders of the Senior Notes. 
  Investments in subsidiaries are recorded on the equity basis.  
        The following tables set forth condensed consolidating balance sheets as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   and condensed consolidating statements of operations and comprehensive income for the periods January 1 and July 1 through August 14, 2015(Predecessor), the period August 15 through September 30, 2015 (Successor), and the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (Successor) and condensed consolidating statements of cashflows for the periods January 1 through August 14, 2015 (Predecessor), August 15 through September 30, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor) of the Parent Guarantors and the Non-Guarantors.

Our expectations and targets are not predictions of actual performance and historically our performance has deviated, often significantly, from our expectations and targets. Actual future events and circumstances (including future results and trends) could differ materially, positively or negatively, from those set forth in these statements due to various factors. These factors include: 
             
    the possibility that additions to capacity for producing EAF steel, increases in overall EAF steel production capacity, and increases or other changes in steel production may not occur or may not occur at the rates that we anticipate or may not be as geographically disbursed as we anticipate; 
                
    the possibility that increases or decreases in graphite electrode manufacturing capacity (including growth by producers in developing countries), competitive pressures (including changes in, and the mix, distribution, and pricing of, competitive products), reduction in specific consumption rates, increases or decreases in customer inventory levels, or other changes in the graphite electrode markets may occur, which may impact demand for, prices or unit and dollar volume sales of graphite electrodes and growth or profitability of our graphite electrodes business; 
                
    the possible failure of changes in EAF steel production or graphite electrode production to result in stable or increased, or offset decreases in, graphite electrode demand, prices, or sales volume;

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Global Economic Conditions and Outlook 
    
  Outlook  . We are impacted in varying degrees, both positively and negatively, as global, regional or country conditions fluctuate. Our discussions about market data and global economic conditions below are based on or derived from published industry accounts and statistics.  
  In its July, 2016 report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reduced its estimated global growth by 0.1% for both 2016 and 2017 to 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively.  This revision was primarily the result of the U.K. vote to exit the European union ("Brexit") as the IMF stated pre-Brexit estimates indicated a 0.1% increase in global growth for 2017.  Projections for advanced economies declined 0.1% and 0.2% to 1.8% for both 2016 and 2017.  Emerging market and developing economies estimates remained diverse.  
  In its short range outlook released on October 11, 2016, the World Steel Association (WSA) forecasts that global steel demand will increase by 0.2% percent to 1,501 million tons in 2016 and 0.5% in 2017. This estimate is higher than the 1,488 million tons that WSA forecasted in April for 2016.  WSA noted that the increase was primarily attributable to a better than expected forecast for China and continued growth in emerging economies.  In developed economies, the WSA expects steel demand to grow by 0.2% in 2016 and 1.1% in 2017.  This represents a downward estimate of 1.5% for 2016 due to slower growth in the United States and the effects of Brexit.

Results of Operations and Segment Review 
  The Periods July 1 Through August 15, 2015 (Predecessor) and August 15 Through   September 30, 2015   (Successor) as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 (Successor). 
  The tables presented in our period-over-period comparisons summarize our Consolidated Statements of Operations and illustrate key financial indicators used to assess the consolidated financial results.  Throughout our MD A, insignificant changes may be deemed not meaningful and are generally excluded from the discussion. 
  Business Combination Accounting 
  As a result of business combination accounting resulting from our acquisition by Brookfield (see Note 2 "  Preferred Share Issuance and Merger  "), the Company's financial statements are separated into two distinct periods, the period before the consummation of the Brookfield transaction (labeled predecessor) and the period after that date (labeled successor), to indicate the application of different basis of accounting between the periods presented.  

Net sales.   Net sales for our Industrial Materials segment decreased from   $51.6 million   in the period July 1 through August 14, 2015 and   $74.8 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015     to   $111.6 million     in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Our graphite electrode product line was negatively impacted by a 29% decline in the weighted average selling price compared to the same period of the prior year decreasing revenues by $41.2 million.  This decline in sales price was partially offset by a 22% increase in sales volumes. 
  Cost of sales.   We experienced decreases in cost of sales from   $47.4 million   in the period July 1 through August 14, 2015 and   $67.9 million   in the period August 15 to   September 30, 2015   compared to   $113.6 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This decrease was in spite of the 22% increase in sales volumes and was primarily the result of decreases in the price of raw materials and increased utilization.  Increased utilization was driven primarily by our rationalization initiatives over the last three years, continued cost control initiatives and optimization of our graphite electrode plant capacity.

Lower of cost or market inventory adjustment.    In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred a lower of cost or market adjustment of   $4.9 million   in certain product lines within our graphite electrode business reflecting the aforementioned decreased pricing. 
  Selling and administrative expenses.   Selling and administrative expenses have decreased from   $24.6 million   in the period July 1 through August 14, 2015 and   $6.8 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015   to   $12.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This decrease was primarily driven by one-time charges related to our acquisition in 2015 for stock based compensation vesting and proxy-related fees totaling $18.0 million. 
  Research and development expenses.   Research and development expenses decreased from   $0.7 million   in the period July 1 through August 14, 2015 and    $0.2 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015   to   $0.5 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due primarily to headcount reductions as well as overall cost control measures. 
  Other (Income) Expense.   Other expense decreased from   $0.3 million   in the period July 1 through August 14 and   $0.7 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015  , to income of   $0.6 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due to advantageous foreign currency impacts on non-operating assets and liabilities. 
  Interest Expense  . Interest expense decreased from   $8.8 million   in the period July 1 through August 14, 2015 and    $3.3 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015  , to   $7.0 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to $4.5 million of accelerated interest expense resulting from the prepayment of our senior subordinated notes in the predecessor period.  
  Loss from Discontinued Operations  .  Our loss from discontinued operations improved from a loss of   $6.9 million   in the period July 1 through August 14, 2015 and   $1.9 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015   to income of    $1.1 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This improvement was primarily driven by an  improved cost structure resulting from our rationalization initiatives. 
  Segment operating income (loss).   The following table represents our operating income (loss) by segment: 

Provision for income taxes.   The following table summarizes the expense/(benefit) for income taxes:   

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to recent losses in foreign jurisdictions where a tax benefit will be recognized, offset by recent losses in the U.S. and Switzerland where we receive no tax benefit due to a full valuation allowance and worldwide earnings from various countries taxed at different rates. The recognition of the valuation allowance does not result in or limit the

Company's ability to utilize these tax assets in the future. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to recent losses in the U.S. where we receive no tax benefit due to a full valuation allowance and worldwide earnings from various countries taxed at different rates.

  Business Combination Accounting 
  As a result of business combination accounting resulting from our acquisition by Brookfield (see Note 2 "  Preferred Share Issuance and Merger  "), the Company's financial statements are separated into two distinct periods, the period before the consummation of the Brookfield transaction (labeled predecessor) and the period after that date (labeled successor), to indicate the application the of different basis of accounting between the periods presented.  

Net sales.     Net sales for our Industrial Materials segment decreased from   $339.9 million   in the period January 1 through August 14, 2015 and   $74.8 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015   to   $322.5 million     in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  This decrease was primarily driven by a 27% decrease in the weighted average sales price of our graphite electrode products which decreased $109.6 million revenues by $41.2 million compared to the same period of the prior year.  This decrease was partially offset by a 7% increase in volumes.   
  Cost of sales  . Cost of sales decreased from   $305.0 million   for the period January 1 through August 14, 2015 and    $67.9 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015     to   $331.3 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .   This decrease was driven primarily by reduced variable manufacturing costs.  These reductions

  (Unaudited) 

have been driven by lower raw material prices, an improved cost structure from our rationalization initiatives and plant optimization. Cost of sales also benefited from an advantageous currency impact of $8.1 million. 
  Lower of cost or market inventory adjustment.    In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred a lower of cost or market adjustment of   $19.5 million   in certain product lines within our graphite electrode business reflecting the  decreased pricing. 
  Selling and general administrative  .  Selling and general administrative expenses decreased from   $64.4 million   in the period January 1 through August 14, 2015 and   $6.8 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015   compared to   $39.4 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   driven primarily by one-time charges related to our acquisition in 2015 for stock based compensation vesting and proxy-related fees totaling $23.0 million.  Additional decreases have been the result of headcount reductions and continued cost control measures. 
  Impairments.    During the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a $35.4 million goodwill impairment charge in our needle coke reporting unit resulting from price declines that were to take effect in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of overcapacity in the industry. 
  Other (Income) Expense.   Other expense decreased from   $1.4 million   in the period January 1 through August 14 and   $0.7 million   in the period August 14 through   September 30, 2015  , to income of   $1.5 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   due to due to advantageous foreign currency impacts on non-operating assets and liabilities. 
  Interest Expense  . Interest expense decreased from   $26.2 million   in the period January 1 through August 14, 2015 and   $3.3 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015   to   $19.9 million   in   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to the repayment of our Senior Subordinated Notes in August 2015 which has reduced our overall annual interest expense.  The prepayment also resulted in a $4.5 million accelerated interest charge within the predecessor period. 
  Loss from Discontinued Operations  . Results from our discontinued operations improved from a loss of    $18.7 million   in the period January 1 through August 14, 2015 and   $1.9 million   in the period August 15 through   September 30, 2015   to   $107.6 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .   This decrease was driven by in impairment charge of   $105.6 million   to align the value of our assets held for sale with the estimated fair market value as of   September 30, 2016  .  This was partially offset by an improved cost structure resulting from our rationalization initiatives. 
  Segment operating income (loss).   The results discussed above are reflected in our operating income (loss) by segment as follows:  

Provision for income taxes.   The following table summarizes the expense/(benefit) for income taxes:

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to recent losses in foreign jurisdictions where a tax benefit will be recognized, offset by recent losses in the U.S. and Switzerland where we receive no tax benefit due to a full valuation allowance and worldwide earnings from various countries tax at different rates. The recognition of the valuation allowance does not result in or limit the Company's ability to utilize these tax assets in the future. The provision for income taxes for the   nine months ended   ended   September 30, 2015   differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to recent losses in the U.S. where we receive no tax benefit due to a full valuation allowance and worldwide earnings from various countries taxed at different rates. 
   
     Effects of Changes in Currency Exchange Rates 
  When the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline (or increase) in value relative to the U.S. dollar, this has the effect of reducing (or increasing) the U.S. dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities. In certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities, and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets, we sell in currencies other than the dollar. Accordingly, when these currencies increase (or decline) in value relative to the dollar, this has the effect of increasing (or reducing) net sales. The result of these effects is to increase (or decrease) operating profit and net income. 
  Many of the non-U.S. countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic and political changes, which have significantly impacted currency exchange rates. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales, cost of sales or net income.  
  For net sales of Industrial Materials, the impact of changes in the average exchange rates of other currencies against the U.S. dollar for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was an decrease of $0.4 million compared to the same period of 2015. The impact of the exchange rate changes on cost of sales of Industrial Materials for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was a decrease of $8.1 million compared to the same period of 2015. 
  As part of our cash management, we also have intercompany loans between our subsidiaries. These loans are deemed to be temporary and, as a result, remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as currency gains / losses in other income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  The remeasurement of intercompany loans and the effect of transaction gains and losses on intercompany activities resulted in a gain of $0.9 million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   compared to a loss of $0.9 million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  We have in the past and may in the future use various financial instruments to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by currency exchange rate changes, as described under  Part I, Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . 
   
     Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $12.1 million  , long-term debt of   $364.1 million  , short-term debt of   $6.5 million   and stockholder s equity of   $637 million  .  
  On   April 27, 2016  , GrafTech and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment to the Revolving Facility.   As a result of the amendment, the size of the Revolving Facility was permanently reduced from $375 million to $225 million. New covenants were also added to the Revolving Facility, including a requirement to make mandatory repayments of outstanding amounts under the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility with the proceeds of any sale of all or any substantial part of the assets included in the Engineered Solutions segment and a requirement to maintain minimum liquidity (consisting of domestic cash, cash equivalents and availability under the Revolving Facility) in excess of $25 million. The covenants were also modified to provide for: the elimination of certain exceptions to the Company s negative covenants limiting the Company s ability to make certain investments, sell assets, make restricted payments, incur liens and incur debt; a restriction on the amount of cash and cash equivalents permitted to be held on the balance sheet at any one time without paying down the Revolving Facility; and changes to the Company s financial covenants so that, until the earlier of March 31, 2019 or the Company has $75 million in trailing twelve month EBITDA, the Company is required to maintain trailing twelve month EBITDA above certain minimums ranging from  
  ($40 million) to $35 million after which the Company s existing financial covenants under the Revolving Facility will apply. 
  With this amendment, the Company has full access to the $225 million Revolving Facility, subject to the $25 million minimum liquidity requirement.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $61.5 million   of borrowings on the Revolving Facility and   $13.9 million   of letters of credit drawn against the Revolving Facility.  In addition to the Revolving Facility, the Company has   $36.0 million   outstanding on its Term Loan Facility. 
  We use cash flow from operations and funds available under the Revolving Facility (subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants and representations under the Revolving Facility) as well as cash on hand as our primary sources of liquidity.  The Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility both mature in April 2019. Under the Revolving Facility, we have additional flexibility for investments, capital expenditures and acquisitions and we can issue letters of credit under the Revolving Facility in an amount not to exceed $35 million.  
  The interest rate applicable to the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility is LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2.25% to 4.75% (depending on our total senior secured leverage ratio). The borrowers pay a per annum fee ranging from 0.35% to 0.70% (depending on our senior secured leverage ratio) on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the Revolving Facility.  
    
    Senior Notes 
  On November 20, 2012, the Company issued $300 million principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee certain other indebtedness of the Company or another guarantor. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The Senior Notes mature on November 15, 2020. 
    
  If, prior to maturity, a change in control (as defined in the indenture) of the Company occurs and thereafter certain downgrades of the ratings of the Senior Notes as specified in the indenture occur, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase any or all of the Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.  
    As of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , approximately 73% and 74% of our debt, respectfully,  consisted of fixed rate or zero interest rate obligations. 
  Cash Flow and Plans to Manage Liquidity.   Our cash flow typically fluctuates significantly between quarters due to various factors. These factors include customer order patterns, fluctuations in working capital requirements, timing of capital expenditures, acquisitions and other factors. 
  The Company has access to a $225 million Revolving Facility (subject to a $25 million minimum liquidity requirement). As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $61.5 million   of borrowings and   $13.9 million   of letters of credit, for a total of   $75.4 million   drawn against the Revolving Facility. 
  Potential uses of our liquidity include capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt repayments and other general purposes, including cash outflows related to rationalization activities. Continued volatility in the global economy may require additional borrowings under the Revolving Facility. An improving economy, while resulting in improved results of operations, could increase our cash requirements to purchase inventories, make capital expenditures and fund payables and other obligations until increased accounts receivable are converted into cash. A downturn could significantly and negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, which, coupled with increased borrowings, could negatively impact our credit ratings, our ability to comply with debt covenants, our ability to secure additional financing and the cost of such financing, if available. 
  In the event that operating cash flows fail to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our business needs, including capital expenditures, any such shortfall would need to be made up by increased borrowings under our Revolving Facility, to the extent available.  We have begun to look at strategic alternatives for our Engineered Solutions businesses that could result in the sale of one or more of such businesses. Cash proceeds from such sales would be used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility. We cannot assure you that we will, or will

be able to, consummate any such sales on acceptable terms or at all or as to the price, terms or conditions of any such sales.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants contained in the Revolving Facility, as applicable.  
  In order to seek to minimize our credit risks, we may reduce our sales of, or refuse to sell (except for cash on delivery or under letters of credit) our products to some customers and potential customers. In the current economic environment, our customers may experience liquidity shortages or difficulties in obtaining credit, including letters of credit. Our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide have not been material during the last 3 years individually or in the aggregate. We cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future. 
  We manage our capital expenditures taking into account quality, plant reliability, safety, environmental and regulatory requirements, prudent or essential maintenance requirements, global economic conditions, available capital resources, liquidity, long-term business strategy and return on invested capital for the relevant expenditures, cost of capital and return on invested capital of the relevant segment and GrafTech as a whole, and other factors.  
  We had positive cash flow from operating activities during 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and through   September 30, 2016  .  Although the global economic environment experienced significant swings in these periods, our working capital management and cost-control initiatives allowed us to remain operating cash flow positive in both times of declining and improving operating results.  
  Related Party Transactions  . We have not engaged in or been a party to any other material transactions with affiliates or related parties except for reimbursement of certain costs incurred by Brookfield as required under the Investment Agreement, transactions with our current or former subsidiaries, compensatory transactions with directors and officers including employee benefits (including reimbursement to Brookfield for compensation costs incurred by it for certain personnel who devote substantially all of their working time to us), stock option and restricted stock grants, compensation deferral, stock purchases, and customary indemnification and expense advancement arrangements. 
  Cash Flows. 
  The following table summarizes our cash flow activities: 

Operating Activities 
  Cash flow from operating activities represents cash receipts and cash disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net income (loss) for: 
             
    Non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization; post retirement obligations, severance and pension plan changes; and stock-based compensation charges; 
                
    Gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities such as gains and losses on the sale of assets and unrealized currency transaction gains and losses; 
                
    Changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations.

The net impact of the changes in working capital (operating assets and liabilities), which are discussed in more detail below, include the impact of changes in: receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, accrued taxes, interest payable, and payments of other current liabilities. 
  During the period January 1 through August 14, 2015, changes in working capital resulted in a net source of funds of $45.6 million which was impacted by: 
             
    net cash inflows in accounts receivable of $61.0 million from the decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing and collection of customer sales and collections; 
                
    net cash outflows from decreases in accounts payable and accruals of $18.7 million, due primarily to changes in tax accruals and payables; and 
                
    a decrease in interest expense of $2.3 million. 
     During the period August 15 through September 30, 2015, there was no significant change to net working capital. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , changes in working capital resulted in a net source of funds of   $54.0 million   which was impacted by: 
             
    net cash inflows in accounts receivable of   $9.7 million   from the decrease in accounts receivable due to the collection of customer sales; 
                
    net cash inflows from decreases in inventory of   $41.4 million  , due primarily to inventory management initiatives;  
                
    net cash outflows from increased prepaid expense of   $1.2 million   due to value added tax payments; 
                
    net cash inflows due to increase in accounts payable and accruals of   $1.8 million   primarily resulting from timing of payments. 
     Other uses of cash in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included contributions to pension and other benefit plans of $8.8 million.  
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was $39.9 million during the period January 1 through August 14, 2015 and included capital expenditures of $32.3 million and $8.3 million  related to cash settlements of derivative instruments.  During the period August 15 through September 30, 2015 net cash used in investing activities was $4.6 million resulting primarily from $5.2 million of capital expenditures. 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $22.7 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and included capital expenditures of   $22.3 million   and   $1.2 million    related to cash settlements of derivative instruments.  
     Financing Activities 
  Net cash inflow from financing activities was $20.8 million during the period January 1 through August 14, 2015. We received $150 million of cash as proceeds from our issuance of preferred shares and had net borrowings under our Revolving Facility and short term debt agreements resulted in a source of cash of $79.5 million.  These were offset by the $200 million repayment of our Senior Subordinated Notes, $5.1 million of credit facility refinancing fees and $3.4 million of preferred share issuance costs. 
  Net cash inflow from financing activities was   $1.5 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , resulting from net borrowings   $0.5 million   under our Revolving Facility and fees paid for the refinancing of our revolving credit facility totaling   $0.9 million  . 
   
  Restrictions on Dividends and Stock Repurchases 
    It has generally been the policy of our Board of Directors to retain earnings to finance strategic and other plans and programs, conduct business operations, fund acquisitions, meet obligations and repay debt. We did not pay any

cash dividends in 2013, 2014 or 2015. We periodically review our dividend policy.  We amended our Credit Facility on April 27, 2016 and, under the terms of the amendment, we are restricted from paying dividends.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, energy commodity prices and commercial energy rates. We, from time to time, routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage these well-defined risks. These transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described below. Since the counterparties to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions, we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. 
  Our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from floating rate long-term debt tied to LIBOR or Euro LIBOR. Our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from: 
             
    sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies; 
                
    raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies; and 
                
    investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries, to the extent denominated in currencies other than the dollar. 
     Our exposure to changes in energy commodity prices and commercial energy rates results primarily from the purchase or sale of refined oil products and the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations. 
  Currency Rate Management.   We enter into foreign currency derivatives from time to time to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. These foreign currency derivatives, which include, but are not limited to, forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options, attempt to hedge global currency exposures. Forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate. Purchased foreign currency options are instruments which give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates. Forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value. 
  The outstanding foreign currency derivatives as of   December 31, 2015   represented no unrealized gain or loss. The net unrealized loss as of   September 30, 2016   was $0.4 million. 
  Energy Commodity Management  . We periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas and refined oil product exposure. We had no outstanding commodity derivative contracts as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Interest Rate Risk Management.   We periodically implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize our interest expense and the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations. 
  We periodically enter into agreements with financial institutions that are intended to limit, or cap, our exposure to incurrence of additional interest expense due to increases in variable interest rates. These instruments effectively cap our interest rate exposure. We currently do not have any such instruments outstanding. 
  Sensitivity Analysis.   We use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the fair values of our foreign currency derivatives and our commodity derivatives. The sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction. As of   September 30, 2016  , a 10% appreciation or depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a corresponding decrease of $1.9 million or a corresponding increase of $1.9 million, respectively, in the fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. 
  We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . A hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points (1%)     would have increased our interest expense by $0.8 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures at the reasonable assurance level. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a reporting company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by it in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  . There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors disclosed in Part I-Item IA of the Annual Report. 
       
  As a result of the June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union, global markets and foreign currencies have been adversely impacted. In particular, the value of the Pound Sterling has sharply declined as compared to the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. This volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the U.K. negotiates and executes its exit from the European Union but it is uncertain over what time period this will occur. A significantly weaker Pound Sterling compared to the U.S. Dollar could have a significant negative effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
