    N  OTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (Unaudited) 

1.   Basis of Presentation

The Company 

American Express Credit Corporation (Credco), together with its subsidiaries, is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express Company (American Express). American Express charge cards and American Express credit cards are collectively referred to herein as the card.

Credco is engaged in the business of financing non-interest-earning Card Member receivables arising from the use of the American Express    Green Card, the American Express    Gold Card, Platinum Card   , Corporate Card and other American Express cards issued in the United States and in certain countries outside the United States. Credco also finances certain interest-earning revolving loans generated by Card Member spending on American Express credit cards issued in non-U.S. markets, although interest-earning revolving loans are primarily funded by subsidiaries of TRS other than Credco.

Credco executes material transactions with its affiliates. The agreements between Credco and its affiliates provide that the parties intend that the transactions thereunder be conducted on an arm s length basis; however, there can be no assurance that the terms of these arrangements are the same as would be negotiated between independent, unrelated parties.

American Express provides Credco with financial support with respect to maintenance of its minimum overall 1.25 fixed charge coverage ratio, which is achieved by charging appropriate discount rates on the purchases of receivables Credco makes from, and the interest rates on the loans Credco provides to, TRS and other American Express subsidiaries. Each monthly period, the discount and interest rates are determined to generate income for Credco that is sufficient to maintain its minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The revenue earned by Credco from purchasing Card Member receivables and loans at a discount is reported as discount revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Retained Earnings.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Credco s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (Form 10-K). If not materially different, certain footnote disclosures included therein have been omitted from this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The interim consolidated financial information in this report has not been audited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period consolidated financial information, have been made. Results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year.

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on revenue recognition. The guidance establishes the principles to apply to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition, specifying the accounting for certain costs related to revenue, and requiring additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and related cash flows. The guidance, as amended, supersedes most of the current revenue recognition requirements, and is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption as of January 1, 2017, permitted. Credco does not intend to adopt the new standard early and continues to evaluate the method of implementation and the impact this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows, among other items.

    N  OTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (Unaudited)  

In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The guidance, which is effective January 1, 2018, makes targeted changes to current GAAP, specifically to the classification and measurement of equity securities, and to certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. Credco continues to evaluate the impact this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows, among other items.

In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, which is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information and will likely result in earlier recognition of credit reserves. Credco does not intend to adopt the new standard early and is currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows; however, it is expected that the new CECL model will alter the assumptions used in calculating credit losses on Card Member receivables and loans, among other financial instruments, and may result in material changes to Credco s credit reserves.

Other Information 

During the second quarter of 2016, American Express completed the sales of substantially all of its outstanding Card Member loans and receivables held for sale (HFS) related to its cobrand partnership with Costco Wholesale Corporation in the United States. Since Credco owns participation interests in receivables purchased from American Express Receivables Financing Corporation VIII LLC (RFC VIII), Credco also sold back all of its participation interests in Card Member receivables HFS to RFC VIII.

Effective for the first quarter of 2016, American Express realigned its businesses as announced during the fourth quarter of 2015, which combined its corporate and small business organizations into a business-to-business focused group and combined its merchant-related businesses, among other changes. To enhance the comparability and usefulness of Credco s financial statements with that of American Express, Credco has made certain reclassifications of its classes of Card Member receivables and loans for the periods presented. These reclassifications did not have any impact on Credco s underlying assumptions or judgments with respect to reserves for losses or credit performance.

2.   Card Member Receivables and Loans

American Express  charge and lending payment card products result in the generation of Card Member receivables and Card Member loans, respectively. This Note is presented excluding amounts associated with the Card Member receivables HFS as of December 31, 2015; Credco did not have any Card Member receivables HFS as of September 30, 2016.

The net volume of Card Member receivables purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $161 billion and $167 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Credco Receivables Corporation (CRC) owned approximately $1.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of participation interests in Card Member receivables purchased without recourse from RFC VIII.

Card Member Receivables and Loans Aging 

Generally, a Card Member account is considered past due if payment is not received within 30 days after the billing statement date. The following table presents the aging of Card Member receivables and Card Member loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

(a) 
 For Global Corporate Payments Card Member receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member s billing statement date. In addition, if collection procedures are initiated on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes .  

(b) 
 Delinquency data for periods other than 90 days past billing is not available due to system constraints. Therefore, such data has not been utilized for risk management purposes. The balances that are current to 89 days past due can be derived as the difference between the Total and the 90+ Days Past Due balances.

3.   Reserves for Losses

Reserves for losses relating  to Card Member receivables and loans represent management s best estimate of the probable inherent losses in Credco s outstanding portfolio of receivables and loans, as of the balance sheet date. Management s evaluation process requires certain estimates and judgments. 

This Note is presented excluding amounts associated with the Card Member receivables HFS as of December 31, 2015;  Credco did not have any Card Member receivables HFS as of September 30, 2016.

Changes in Card Member Receivables Reserve for Losses 

The following table presents changes in the Card Member receivables reserve for losses for the nine months ended September 30:

(a)

Primarily reserve balances applicable to new groups of Card Member receivables purchased from TRS and certain of its subsidiaries and participation interests from affiliates. New groups of Card Member receivables purchased totaled $3.4 billion and $5.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(c)

Primarily reserve balances applicable to participation interests in Card Member receivables sold to an affiliate. Sale of participation interests totaled $4.7 billion and $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Changes in Card Member Loans Reserve for Losses 

The following table presents changes in the Card Member loans reserve for losses for the nine months ended September 30:

4.   Derivatives and Hedging Activities

Credco uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage exposures to various market risks. These instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rates and foreign exchange rates, and are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of Credco s market risk management. Credco does not transact in derivatives for trading purposes.

In relation to Credco s credit risk, under the terms of the derivative agreements it has with its various counterparties, Credco is not required to either immediately settle any outstanding liability balances or post collateral upon the occurrence of a specified credit risk-related event. Based on its assessment of the credit risk of Credco s derivative counterparties as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Credco does not have derivative positions that warrant credit valuation adjustments.

The following table summarizes the total fair value, excluding interest accruals, of derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

(a) 
 Represents the offsetting of derivatives and the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) arising from derivatives executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement. Additionally, Credco posted $124 million and $128 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, as initial margin on its centrally cleared interest rate swaps; such amounts are recorded within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the derivative balances. 

(b) 
 Represents the amount of netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement. 

(c) 
 Credco has no individually significant derivative counterparties and therefore, no significant risk exposure to any single derivative counterparty. The total net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities are presented within Other assets and Accrued interest and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

A majority of Credco s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are subject to master netting agreements with its derivative counterparties. Credco has no derivative amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Fair Value Hedges 

Credco is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its fixed-rate long-term debt. Credco uses interest rate swaps to economically convert certain fixed-rate debt obligations to floating-rate obligations at the time of issuance. Credco hedged $14.1 billion and $15.9 billion of its fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt using interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

The following table summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in Other expenses associated with Credco s fair value hedges for the three and nine months ended September 30:

Credco also recognized a net reduction in interest expense on long-term debt of $32 million and $47 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $100   million and $133 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily related to the net settlements (interest accruals) on Credco s interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges.

  (Unaudited)  

Net Investment Hedges 

The effective portion of the gain or loss on net investment hedges, net of taxes, recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCI) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment, was a loss of $29 million and a gain of $188 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a loss of $28 million and a gain of $274 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with any ineffective portion recognized in Other expenses during the period of change. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Credco did not reclassify any amounts from AOCI to earnings as a component of Other expenses and no ineffectiveness was recognized in either period.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges 

The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are intended to offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses of the underlying foreign currency exposures. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related underlying foreign currency exposures resulted in a net gain of $3 million and a net loss of $6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net gains of $1 million and $22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are recognized in Other expenses.

Related to its derivatives not designated as hedges, Credco previously disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015, gains of $42 million and $11 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. These amounts should have been disclosed as gains of $12 million and $291 million, respectively, which are the amounts used to calculate the above-referenced net loss of $6 million and net gain of $22 million. Similarly, Credco is revising the full year 2015 and 2014 amounts of change in fair value of its derivatives not designated as hedges previously disclosed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, from a loss of $5 million to a gain of $293 million for 2015 and from a gain of $133 million to a gain of $587 million for 2014. Due to the netting as described in the above paragraph, these changes to the previously disclosed amounts have no impact on Credco s Consolidated Statements of Income and Retained Earnings, Balance Sheets or Cash Flows. 

5.   Fair Values

Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Fair Value 

The following table summarizes Credco s financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, categorized under the fair valuation hierarchy as Level 2, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Other Than Fair Value 

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of Credco s financial assets and financial liabilities that are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The fair values of these financial instruments are estimates based upon the market conditions and perceived risks as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and require management s judgment. These figures may not be indicative of future fair values, nor can the fair value of Credco be estimated by aggregating the amounts presented.

(a) 
 Level 1 amounts reflect interest-bearing deposits in banks and Level 2 amounts reflect time deposits and short-term investments. 

(b) 
 Reflects carrying value and the associated fair value of Card Member receivables HFS of $24 million but does not include any fair value associated with Card Member account relationships. 

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and during the year ended December 31, 2015, Credco did not have any assets that were measured at fair value due to impairment on a nonrecurring basis.

6.   Variable Interest Entity

Credco has established a Variable Interest Entity (VIE), American Express Canada Credit Corporation (AECCC), used primarily to lend funds to affiliates, through the issuance of notes in Canada under a medium-term note program. All notes issued under this program are fully guaranteed by Credco. Credco is considered the primary beneficiary of the entity and owns all of the outstanding voting interests and, therefore, consolidates the entity. Total assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, the majority of which were eliminated in consolidation. Total liabilities as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $1.7 billion. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1.3 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, of liabilities were eliminated in consolidation. The assets of the VIE are not used solely to settle the obligations of the VIE. The note holders of the VIE have recourse to Credco.

8.   Income Taxes

The results of operations of Credco are included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of American Express. Under an agreement with American Express, provision for income taxes is recognized on a separate company basis. If benefits for net operating losses, future tax deductions and foreign tax credits cannot be recognized on a separate company basis, such benefits are then recognized based upon a share, derived by formula, of those deductions and credits that are recognizable on an American Express consolidated reporting basis.

American Express is under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which American Express has significant business operations. The tax years under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction. The IRS has completed its field examination of American Express  federal tax returns for years through 2007; however, refund claims for certain years continue to be reviewed by the IRS. In addition, American Express is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2008 through 2014.

Credco believes it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by as much as $294 million principally as a result of potential resolutions of prior years  tax items with various taxing authorities. The prior years  tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of the $294 million of unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $289 million relates to amounts that if recognized would be recorded in shareholder s equity and would not impact Credco s results of operations or its effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate was 14.3 percent and 12.5 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 13.3 percent and 15.2 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The changes in tax rates primarily reflected the geographic mix of expenses in the United States attracting a 35 percent statutory benefit and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, which are indefinitely reinvested. In addition, the effective tax rate in each of the periods reflects the impact of certain prior years  tax items.

The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflect out-of-period corrections that increased tax expense by $11 million. The corrections relate to tax calculations of foreign exchange gains/losses in one jurisdiction reflected in the 2014 results. None of the current or prior period financial statements were materially misstated from these corrections.

The tax rate in each of the periods reflects the favorable impact of the tax benefit related to Credco s ongoing funding activities outside the United States. Credco s provision for income taxes for interim financial periods is not based on an estimated annual effective rate due to volatility in certain components of revenues and expenses that prevents Credco from projecting a reliable estimate of full year pretax income. A discrete calculation of the provision for income taxes is calculated for each interim period.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

American Express Credit Corporation (Credco), together with its subsidiaries, is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express Company (American Express). Both American Express and TRS are bank holding companies.

Credco is engaged in the business of financing non-interest-earning Card Member receivables arising from the use of the American Express    Green Card, the American Express    Gold Card, Platinum Card   , Corporate Card and other American Express cards issued in the United States and in certain countries outside the United States. Credco also finances certain interest-earning revolving loans generated by Card Member spending on American Express credit cards issued in non-U.S. markets, although interest-earning and revolving loans are primarily funded by subsidiaries of TRS other than Credco. American Express charge cards and American Express credit cards are collectively referred to herein as the card.

Certain of the statements in this Form 10-Q report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to the  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  section.

Business Overview

Management s discussion of the results of Credco is in the context of the wider business environment for American Express.

During the third quarter, American Express remained focused on its key initiatives to accelerate its revenue growth, optimize its investments and reset its cost base. American Express  results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, reflected progress on its cost reduction efforts and steady credit performance, partially offset by its higher level of investment spending and a restructuring charge.

Competition remains intense across American Express  businesses, particularly in the U.S. While American Express  businesses are global and diversified, to remain competitive American Express needs to continue to demonstrate the value it delivers to its merchants, customers and business partners in all aspects of its relationships.

Effective December 1, 2015, American Express transferred the Card Member loans and receivables related to its cobrand partnerships with JetBlue and Costco in the United States to Card Member loans and receivables held for sale (HFS) on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, the sales of which were completed on March 18, 2016 and June 17, 2016, respectively. For the periods from December 1, 2015 through the sale completion dates, the primary impacts beyond the HFS classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were to provisions for losses and credit metrics, which do not reflect amounts related to these HFS loans and receivables, as credit costs were reported in Other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment. 

Since Credco owns participation interests in receivables purchased from American Express Receivables Financing Corporation VIII LLC (RFC VIII), Credco also sold back all of its participation interests in Card Member receivables HFS to RFC VIII.

Effective for the first quarter of 2016, American Express realigned its businesses as announced during the fourth quarter of 2015, which combined its corporate and small business organizations into a business-to-business focused group and combined its merchant-related businesses, among other changes. To enhance the comparability and usefulness of Credco s financial statements with that of American Express, Credco has made certain reclassifications of its classes of Card Member receivables and loans for the periods presented. These reclassifications did not have any impact on Credco s underlying assumptions or judgments with respect to reserves for losses or credit performance.

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Net income depends largely on the volume of Card Member receivables and loans purchased, the discount factor used to determine purchase price, interest earned, interest expense, collectability of Card Member receivables and loans purchased and income taxes.

Credco s consolidated net income increased $12 million or 8 percent for the nine months ended September 30,   2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to lower Interest expense and Provision for losses partially offset by lower Interest income from affiliates and other and discount revenue earned from purchased Card Member receivables and loans. The following table summarizes the changes for the nine months ended September 30:

Table 1: Changes Attributable to the Increase (Decrease) in Key Revenue and Expense Accounts

Discount revenue earned from purchased Card Member receivables and loans

Discount revenue decreased 2 percent or $7 million to $352 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in net volume of purchased receivables and loans by $6 billion or 4 percent to $164 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Interest income from affiliates and other

Interest income from affiliates and other decreased 19 percent or $36 million to $158 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a 14 percent or $2 billion decrease in average loan balances with affiliates and other to $12 billion, and a decrease of 9 basis points in the annualized effective interest rate charged to affiliates and other to 1.79 percent.

Finance revenue

Finance revenue increased 32 percent or $7 million to $29 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year,   driven by an increase in interest rates and an increase in the average Card Member loan balances outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $431 million as compared to $390 million for the same period in the prior year.

Table of Contents 

Provisions for losses

Provisions for losses decreased 13 percent or $15 million to $105 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by lower net write-offs and improved delinquencies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Interest expense

Interest expense decreased 16 percent or $44 million to $239 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in annualized effective interest rates on average debt outstanding by 13 basis points to 1.44 percent, and a decrease in average debt outstanding by 8 percent or $2 billion to $22 billion.

Interest expense to affiliates

Interest expense to affiliates increased by $9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in the annualized effective interest rate on average debt to affiliates outstanding by 25 basis points to 44 basis points in 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year.

Other, net

The benefit recorded in Other, net decreased $6 million to a benefit of $13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a benefit of $19 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a $21 million decrease in the forward point gains, partially offset by an increase in the fair value hedge ineffectiveness gains by $14 million.

Income taxes

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 12.5 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflect out-of-period corrections that increased tax expense by $11 million. The corrections relate to tax calculations of foreign exchange gains/losses in one jurisdiction reflected in the 2014 results. None of the current or prior period financial statements were materially misstated from these corrections.

The tax rate in each of the periods primarily reflects the favorable impact of the tax benefit related to Credco s ongoing funding activities outside the United States as well as the impact of prior years  tax items.

Card Member Receivables and Card Member Loans 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Credco owned $16.1 billion and $17.6 billion, respectively, of gross Card Member receivables. Card Member receivables represent amounts due on American Express charge card products and are recorded at the time they are purchased from the seller. Included in Card Member receivables are Credco Receivables Corporation s (CRC) purchases of the participation interests from RFC VIII in conjunction with TRS  securitization program. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, CRC owned approximately $1.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of such participation interests.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Credco owned gross Card Member loans totaling $431 million and $435 million, respectively. These loans generally represent revolving amounts due on American Express lending card products.

Loans to Affiliates and Other 

Credco s loans to affiliates and other represent floating-rate interest-bearing borrowings by American Express Company, other wholly owned subsidiaries of TRS and the joint ventures that issue American Express cards in certain countries. The components of loans to affiliates and other as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:

Table 3: Loans to Affiliates and Other

(a) 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately $3.3 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, were collateralized by the underlying Card Member receivables and loans transferred with recourse. 

Due from/to Affiliates 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, amounts due from affiliates were $36 million and $615 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, amounts due to affiliates were $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. These amounts relate primarily to timing differences from the purchase of Card Member receivables, net of remittances from TRS, as well as from operating activities . 

Short-term Debt to Affiliates 

Short-term debt to affiliates consists primarily of master note agreements for which there is no stated term. Credco does not expect any changes to its short-term funding strategies with affiliates. Components of short-term debt to affiliates as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:

Table 4: Short-term Debt to Affiliates

21 

Table of Contents 

Service Fees to Affiliates 

Credco s affiliates do not explicitly charge Credco a servicing fee for the servicing of receivables purchased. Instead, Credco receives a lower discount rate on the receivables sold to Credco than would be the case if servicing fees were charged. If a servicing fee had been charged by these affiliates from which Credco purchases receivables, fees to affiliates for servicing receivables would have been approximately $190 million and $181 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Correspondingly, discount revenue would have increased by approximately the same amounts in these periods.

Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Credco s balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:

A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance its assets and meet operating requirements; and 

Liquidity programs that enable Credco to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period, even in the event it is unable to continue to raise new funds under its traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. 

Funding Strategy

American Express has in place an enterprise-wide funding policy. The principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow American Express, including Credco, to meet its maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in its global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile.

Credco has historically relied on the debt capital markets to fulfill a substantial amount of its funding needs. It has a variety of funding sources available to access the debt capital markets, including senior unsecured debentures and commercial paper. One of the principal tenets of Credco s funding strategy is to issue debt with a wide range of maturities to distribute its refinancing requirements across future periods. Credco continues to assess its funding needs and investor demand and could change the mix of its existing sources as well as add new sources to its funding mix. Credco s funding plan is subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as the disruption of financial markets or reductions in market capacity and demand for securities offered by Credco as well as any regulatory changes or changes in its long-term or short-term credit ratings. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond Credco s control.

Credco s funding strategy is designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody s Investor Services (Moody s) and Standard   Poor s (S P). Such ratings help support Credco s access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of its overall funding strategy.

Downgrades in the ratings of Credco s unsecured debt could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under Credco s unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce Credco s borrowing capacity in the unsecured term debt and commercial paper markets. The overall level of the funding provided by Credco to other American Express affiliates is impacted by a variety of factors, among them Credco s ratings. To the extent that Credco is subject to a higher cost of funds, whether due to an adverse ratings action or otherwise, the affiliates could continue to use, or could increase their use of, alternative sources of funding for their receivables that offer better pricing.

Short-term Funding Programs

Short-term borrowing, such as commercial paper, is generally defined as debt with an original maturity of 12 months or less. Credco s issuance and sale of commercial paper is primarily utilized for working capital needs. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on Credco s funding strategy, its needs and market conditions. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Credco had $0.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper outstanding was $0.2 billion and $0.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively.

Long-term Debt Programs

Long-term debt is raised through the offering of debt securities both in and outside the United States. Long-term debt is generally defined as any debt with an original maturity greater than 12 months. Credco had the following long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Table 6: Long-term Debt Outstanding

On October 31, 2016, Credco issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes with a maturity of three years consisting of:

$750 million of fixed-rate senior notes with a coupon of 1.7 percent; and 

$250 million of floating-rate senior notes at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 57 basis points. 

Credco has the ability to issue debt securities under shelf registrations filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The latest shelf registration statement filed with the SEC is for an unspecified amount of debt securities. Credco had $18.2 billion and $20.9 billion of debt securities outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, issued under the SEC registration statement.

Credco has also established a program in Australia for the issuance of debt securities of up to approximately $4.6 billion (AUD $6 billion). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, no notes were issued under this program. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the entire amount of approximately $4.6 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of notes was available for issuance under this program and there were no outstanding notes as of such dates.

Credco has also established a medium-term note program in Canada providing for the issuance of notes by American Express Canada Credit Corporation (AECCC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Credco. The prospectus for this program expired in September 2014. All notes issued by AECCC under this program are guaranteed by Credco. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, no notes were issued under this program. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, AECCC had $0.4 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, of medium-term notes outstanding under this program. AECCC s financial results are included in the consolidated financial results of Credco.

The covenants of debt instruments issued by Credco impose the requirement that Credco maintain a minimum consolidated net worth of $50 million, which limits the amount of dividends Credco can pay to its parent. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Credco paid nil and $76 million, respectively, of cash dividends to TRS. When considering the amount of dividends it pays, Credco takes into account the amount of capital required to maintain capital strength, support business growth, and meet the expectations of debt investors. To the extent excess capital is available, it may be distributed to TRS, Credco s parent company, via dividends. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of Credco to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan. Additionally, there are no limitations on the amount of debt that can be issued by Credco, provided it maintains the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25. As of September 30, 2016, Credco was in compliance with all restrictive covenants contained in its debt agreements.

Liquidity Management

American Express, including Credco, incurs liquidity risk that arises in the course of its activities. The liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. American Express and its subsidiaries, including Credco, seek to maintain liquidity sources, even in the event they are unable to raise new funds under their regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions, in amounts sufficient to meet their expected future financial obligations and businesses  requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months. General principles and the overall framework for managing liquidity risk across American Express on an enterprise-wide basis are set out in American Express  Liquidity Risk Policy.

The liquidity risk exposure could arise from a variety of scenarios. The liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:

Maintaining diversified funding sources; 

Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; 

Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; 

Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements; and 

Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into American Express  capital adequacy framework. 

Credco regularly accesses liquidity through its various funding programs, and maintains a variety of contingent sources of cash and financing, such as access to securitizations of Card Member receivables through sales of receivables to TRS for securitization by RFC VIII and the American Express Issuance Trust II, as well as committed bank facilities.

As of September 30, 2016, Credco had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $685 million. In addition to its actual holdings of cash and cash equivalents, Credco maintains access to additional liquidity, in the form of cash and cash equivalents held by certain affiliates, through intercompany loan agreements.

As of March 1, 2017, regulations implementing the margin requirements under Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act would result in Credco collecting and remitting cash and/or securities collateral relative to the value of certain uncleared derivative transactions (variation margin), which may create or increase collateral posting requirements for Credco.

Committed Bank Credit Facilities

Credco maintained a U.S. dollar denominated committed syndicated bank credit facility as of September 30, 2016 of $3.0 billion, which expires on December 9, 2018. As of September 30, 2016, no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility. The capacity of the facility mainly serves to further enhance Credco s contingent funding resources. The availability of this facility is subject to Credco s compliance with certain financial covenants that require maintenance of a 1.25 ratio of earnings to fixed charges. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges for Credco was 1.75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends for American Express for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 5.95.

The committed syndicated bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility, nor is it dependent on Credco s credit rating.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Credco s management, with the participation of Credco s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of Credco s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, Credco s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, Credco s disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure  that the information required to be disclosed in Credco s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to Credco s management, including Credco s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure .

There have not been any changes in Credco s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during Credco s fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Credco s internal control over financial reporting.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

Various statements have been made in this Quarterly Report on this Third Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q that may constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may also be made in Credco s other reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in other documents. In addition, from time to time, Credco, through its management, may make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements.

Credco cautions you that the risk factors described above and in Credco s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the 2015 Form 10-K) and other factors described below are not exclusive. There may also be other risks that Credco is unable to predict at this time that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. Credco undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Credco s forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:

credit trends, which will depend in part on the economic environment, including, among other things, the housing market and the rates of bankruptcies, which can affect spending on card products and debt payments by individual and corporate customers; 

the effectiveness of Credco s risk management policies and procedures, including Credco s ability to accurately estimate the provisions for losses in Credco s outstanding portfolio of Card Member receivables and loans, and operational risk; 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 

negative changes in Credco s credit ratings, which could result in decreased liquidity and higher borrowing costs; 

changes in laws or government regulations affecting American Express  business, including the potential impact of regulations adopted by bank regulators relating to certain credit and charge card practices; 

the effect of fluctuating interest rates, which could affect Credco s borrowing costs; 

the impact on American Express  business resulting from continuing geopolitical uncertainty (including potential impacts resulting from the proposed exit of the U.K. from the European Union); 

the impact on American Express  business that could result from litigation such as class actions or proceedings brought by governmental and regulatory agencies; 

Credco s ability to satisfy its liquidity needs and execute on its funding plans, which will depend on, among other things, Credco s future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, Credco s credit ratings, demand for securities offered by Credco, performance by Credco s counterparties under its bank credit facilities and other lending facilities, and regulatory changes; and 

Credco s tax rate remaining consistent with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, Credco s geographic mix of income being weighted more to higher tax jurisdictions than expected, changes in tax laws and regulation (including final and temporary Treasury regulations under Section 385 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) and unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items.

ITEM 5.   OTHER INFORMATION

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted outside the United States by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.

During the third quarter of 2016, American Express Travel   Lifestyle Services obtained two visas from Iranian embassies in connection with certain travel arrangements on behalf of clients. In addition, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT) and certain entities that may be considered affiliates of GBT have informed American Express that during the third quarter of 2016 they obtained approximately 80 visas from Iranian embassies and consulates around the world in connection with certain travel arrangements on behalf of clients. American Express  had negligible gross revenues and net profits attributable to these transactions and intends to continue to engage in these activities on a limited basis so long as such activities are permitted under U.S. law.
