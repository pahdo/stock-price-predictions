1.   
       Organization
    and Nature of Operations     

Organization
    SQN Asset Income Fund V, L.P. (the  Partnership ) was formed on January 14, 2016, as a Delaware limited
partnership and is engaged in a single business segment, the ownership and investment in leased equipment and related financings
which includes: (i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing;
(iii) acquiring equipment subject to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment
at lease expiration. The Partnership will terminate no later than December 31, 2040.  

Nature
of Operations     The principal investment strategy of the Partnership is to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing
(or cost-savings) equipment or other physical assets with high in-place value and long, relative to the investment term, economic
life and project financings. The Partnership executes its investment strategy by making investments in equipment already subject
to lease or originating equipment leases and loans in such equipment, which will include: (i) purchasing equipment and
leasing it to third-party end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset and project financings; (iii) acquiring equipment
subject to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration. From
time to time, the Partnership may also purchase equipment and sell it directly to its leasing customers. The Partnership may use
other investment structures that SQN Investment Advisors, LLC (the  Investment Manager ) believes will provide the
Partnership with an appropriate level of security, collateralization, and flexibility to optimize its return on its investment
while protecting against downside risk. In many cases, the structure will include the Partnership holding title to or a priority
or controlling position in the equipment or other asset.  

The
General Partner of the Partnership is SQN AIF V GP, LLC (the  General Partner ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Partnership s Investment Manager. Both the Partnership s General Partner and its Investment Manager are Delaware limited
liability companies. The General Partner manages and controls the day to day activities and operations of the Partnership, pursuant
to the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement. The General Partner paid an aggregate capital contribution of $100 for a 1%
interest in the Partnership s income, losses and distributions. The Investment Manager makes all investment decisions and
manages the investment portfolio of the Partnership.  

The Partnership s
income, losses and distributions are allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner until the Limited Partners
have received total distributions equal to their capital contributions plus an 8% per year, compounded annually, cumulative return
on their capital contributions. After such time, all income, losses and distributable cash will be allocated 80% to the Limited
Partners and 20% to the General Partner. The Partnership expects to conduct its activities for at least six years and divide the
Partnership s life into three distinct stages: (i) the Offering Period, (ii) the Operating Period and (iii) the Liquidation
Period. The Offering Period began on August 11, 2016, will terminate no later than two years after this date, unless extended
by our General Partner, from time to time, in its sole discretion, by up to an additional 12 months. The Operating Period will
commence on the date of the Partnership s initial closing and last for four years unless extended at the sole discretion
of the General Partner. During the Operating Period, the Partnership will invest most of the net proceeds from its offering in
business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment, other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in
many cases, associated revenue streams and project financings. The Liquidation Period, which follows the conclusion of the Operating
Period, is the period in which the Partnership will sell its assets in the ordinary course of business and will last two years,
unless it is extended, at the sole discretion of the General Partner. The General Partner may extend the Offering Period, from
time to time, in its sole discretion, by up to an additional 12 months. The General Partner may also extend the Operating Period
and subsequent Liquidation Period in its sole discretion. 

SQN Securities,
LLC ( Securities ), is a Delaware limited liability company, is affiliated with our General Partner. Securities will
act initially as the selling agent for the offering of our units. The units will be offered on a  best efforts,   minimum-maximum 
basis. This means the selling agent must sell at least 120,000 units and receive subscription proceeds of at least $1,200,000
in order for this offering to close (excluding subscription proceeds, if any, from our General Partner or its affiliates and from
residents of Pennsylvania), and it must use only its best efforts to sell our remaining units. Our subscription proceeds will
be held in an interest-bearing escrow account until $1,200,000 has been received. At that time we will admit investors as limited
partners, receive the escrowed subscription proceeds from the escrow agent and pay in cash to such investors  interest earned
on their escrowed subscription proceeds, net of bank fees. Unless extended by our General Partner, from time to time, in its sole
discretion, for up to an additional 12 months, this offering will terminate on the date that is two years from the date of August
11, 2016. If the minimum subscription proceeds are not received within one year from the date of August 11, 2016, then
your subscription proceeds will be promptly returned to you from the escrow account with any interest earned thereon and without
deduction for any fees. 

During
the Operating Period, the Partnership plans to make quarterly distributions of cash to the Limited Partners, if, in the opinion
of the Partnership s Investment Manager, such distributions are in the Partnership s best interests. Therefore, the
amount and rate of cash distributions could vary and are not guaranteed. The targeted distribution rate is 6.0% annually, paid
quarterly as 1.5%, of each Limited Partner s capital contribution (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited
Partner).  

2.   
       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Presentation     The condensed balance sheets, statement of operations, statement of changes in partner s
equity and statement of cash flows of the Partnership at September 30, 2016 and for the period from June 30, 2016 to September
30, 2016 are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim condensed financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results
for the interim periods presented. The results reported in these condensed financial statements should not necessarily be taken
as indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. These unaudited interim condensed financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in the Partnership s Registration Statement on
Form S-1, as filed with the SEC on May 26, 2016 and as amended on July 14, 2016.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents     The Partnership considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of funds maintained in checking and money market
accounts maintained at financial institutions.  

The
Partnership s cash and cash equivalents are held principally at one financial institution and at times may exceed federally
insured limits. The Partnership has placed these funds in an international financial institution in order to minimize risk relating
to exceeding insured limits.  

Restricted
Cash     Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held in an escrow account from subscriptions received in advance
which will be released subject to the receipt and acceptance by the General Partner of subscriptions for 120,000 Units or $1,200,000,
excluding any subscriptions, if any, by the General Partner and its affiliates and Pennsylvania residents.   

Income
Taxes     As a partnership, no provision for income taxes is recorded since the liability for such taxes is the responsibility
of each of the Partners rather than the Partnership. The Partnership s income tax returns are subject to examination by
the federal and state taxing authorities, and changes, if any, could adjust the individual income tax of the Partners.  

Uncertain
Tax Position     The Partnership follows the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ( Uncertain
Tax Position ). Uncertain Tax Position prescribes recognition thresholds that must be met before a tax position is recognized
in the financial statements and provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure, and transition. Under Uncertain Tax Position, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions
that meet a  more likely than not  threshold.  

The
Partnership has adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board s Topic 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes. This accounting guidance prescribes recognition thresholds that must be met before a tax position is recognized
in the financial statements and provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure, and transition. Additionally, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet
a  more likely than not  threshold.  

Use
of estimates -     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Partnership to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance to improve consolidation guidance
for legal entities (Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to Leases Analysis),
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted.
The standard amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases
on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective
transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use
certain transition relief. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial
statements.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

3.   
       Capital
    Contributions    

The
General Partner has made the following cash payments to the Partnership: (i) a General Partner capital contribution of $100, and
(ii) an additional $1,000 for any incidental costs which may arise which is shown as loans payable in the accompanying balance
sheet. The Partnership s Investment Manager made the initial cash payment to the Partnership of $1,000 which was applied
against the Investment Manager s purchase of the initial Limited Partner s interest in the Partnership. Once the Partnership
completes its first closing and admits additional Limited Partners, the initial Limited Partner will be refunded its initial capital
contribution.  

4.   
       Related
    Party Transactions    

The
Partnership will enter into certain agreements with the General Partner, the Investment Manager and Securities, an affiliate of
the General Partner that is acting as exclusive sales agent for the offering of the Partnership s limited partnership units,
whereby the Partnership pays certain fees and reimbursements to these parties.  

Pursuant
to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner is entitled to (i) 1% of the Partnership s profits, losses,
cash distributions and liquidation proceeds, and (ii) a promotional interest in the Partnership, and (iii) a promotional interest
in the Partnership equal to 20% of all distributed distributable cash after the Partnership has provided a return to its Limited
Partners of their respective capital contributions plus an 8% per annum, cumulative return, compounded annually on their capital
contributions. In addition, the General Partner and its affiliates will be reimbursed for organizational and offering expenses
incurred in connection with the Partnership s organization and offering of limited partnership units and certain administrative
expenses incurred in connection with the Partnership s operations. Once the Partnership raises the minimum capital contributions
of $1,200,000, fees and expenses associated with the Partnership s organization and offering costs will become reimbursable
to the Partnership s General Partner and Investment Manager.  

5.   
       Subsequent
    Events    

On October 6, 2016,
the Partnership funded a lease facility of $680,020 for Apple computers to a private school in New York City. The finance
lease requires 39 monthly payments of $17,402. On October 6, 2016, the lessee made an advanced rental payment of $102,002.
The lease is secured by ownership of the equipment. 

On
October 18, 2016, the Partnership funded a lease facility of $318,882 for 16 pizza ovens to five separate lessees. Each lease
has a 36 month term with various monthly payments. The lease is secured by ownership of the equipment.  

On October 21,
2016, the Partnership funded a finance lease of $357,020 for an assortment of school furniture and kitchen equipment to a school
in New Jersey. The finance lease requires 36 monthly payments of $11,647 with the first and last payments due in advance.
The lease is secured by a first position lien against the equipment.

with the disclosures below regarding  Forward-Looking Statements  and the  Risk Factors  set forth in
Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Overview    

We
were organized as a Delaware limited partnership on January 14, 2016 and are engaged in a single business segment, the ownership
and investment in leased equipment and related financings which includes: (i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party
end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring equipment subject to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership
rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration. We will terminate no later than December 31, 2040.  

The
General Partner of the Partnership is SQN AIF V GP, LLC (the  General Partner ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Partnership s Investment Manager. Both the Partnership s General Partner and its Investment Manager are Delaware limited
liability companies. The General Partner manages and controls the day to day activities and operations of the Partnership, pursuant
to the terms of the Partnership Agreement. The General Partner paid an aggregate capital contribution of $100 for a 1% interest
in the Partnership s income, losses and distributions. The Investment Manager makes all investment decisions and manages
the investment portfolio of the Partnership.  

SQN
Securities, LLC ( Securities ), is a Delaware limited liability company, is affiliated with our General Partner. Securities
will act initially as the selling agent for the offering of our units. The units will be offered on a  best efforts, 
 minimum-maximum  basis. This means the selling agent must sell at least 120,000 units and receive subscription proceeds
of at least $1,200,000 in order for this offering to close (excluding subscription proceeds, if any, from our General Partner
or its affiliates and from residents of Pennsylvania), and it must use only its best efforts to sell our remaining units. Our
subscription proceeds will be held in an interest-bearing escrow account until $1,200,000 has been received. At that time we will
admit investors as limited partners, receive the escrowed subscription proceeds from the escrow agent and pay in cash to such
investors  interest earned on their escrowed subscription proceeds, net of bank fees. Unless extended by our General Partner,
from time to time, in its sole discretion, for up to an additional 12 months, this offering will terminate on the date that is
two years from the date of August 11, 2016. If the minimum subscription proceeds are not received within one year from
the date of August 11, 2016, then your subscription proceeds will be promptly returned to you from the escrow account with
any interest earned thereon and without deduction for any fees.  

During the Operating
Period, the Partnership plans to make quarterly distributions of cash to the Limited Partners, if, in the opinion of the Partnership s
Investment Manager, such distributions are in the Partnership s best interests. Therefore, the amount and rate of cash distributions
could vary and are not guaranteed. The targeted distribution rate is 6.0% annually, paid quarterly as 1.5%, of each Limited Partner s
capital contribution (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited Partner). No such distributions were made as of
September 30, 2016, as the Partnership is still in the Offering Period. Our Offering Period commenced on August 11, 2016.
As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership has received $1,670,600 in subscriptions received in advance. 

Our
principal investment strategy is to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-savings) equipment with high in-place
value and long, relative to the investment term, economic life and project financings. We expect to achieve our investment strategy
by making investments in equipment already subject to lease or originating equipment leases in such equipment, which will include:
(i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring
equipment subject to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration.
From time to time, we may also purchase equipment and sell it directly to our leasing customers.  

Many
of our investments will be structured as full payout or operating leases. Full payout leases generally are leases under which
the rent over the initial term of the lease will return our invested capital plus an appropriate return without consideration
of the residual value, and where the lessee may acquire the equipment or other assets at the expiration of the lease term. Operating
leases generally are leases under which the aggregate non-cancelable rental payments during the original term of the lease, on
a net present value basis, are not sufficient to recover the purchase price of the equipment or other assets leased under the
lease.  

We also intend to invest
by way of secured loans, participation agreements and residual sharing agreements where we would acquire an interest in
a pool of equipment or other assets, or rights to the equipment or other assets, at a future date. We may invest in operating
companies that use or own equipment and other assets. We also may structure investments as project financings that are secured
by, among other things, essential use equipment and/or assets. Finally, we may use other investment structures that our Investment
Manager believes will provide us with the appropriate level of security, collateralization, and flexibility to optimize our return
on our investment while protecting against downside risk, such as vendor and rental programs. In many cases, the structure will
include us holding title to or a priority or controlling position in the equipment or other asset. 

Although
the final composition of our portfolio cannot be determined at this stage, we expect to invest in equipment and other assets that
are considered essential use or core to a business or operation in the agricultural, energy, environmental, medical, manufacturing,
technology, and transportation industries. Our Investment Manager may identify other assets or industries that meet our investment
objectives. We expect to invest in equipment, other assets and project financings located primarily within the United States of
America and the European Union but may also make investments in other parts of the world.  

Recent
Significant Transactions    

Subscriptions
Received in Advance   

As
of September 30, 2016, we received $1,670,600 in subscriptions received in advance.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

An
understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The preparation of condensed
unaudited financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires our General Partner and our Investment Manager to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
as of the date of the condensed unaudited financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Results
of Operations for the three months ended September     30, 2016    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we earned no revenue, incurred no expenses and therefore had no operations.  

Results
of Operations for the period from May 26, 2016 (inception) to September     30, 2016    

For
the period from May 26, 2016 (inception) to September 30, 2016, we earned no revenue, incurred no expenses and therefore had no
operations.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Sources
and Uses of Cash    

Sources
of Liquidity    

We
are currently in our Offering Period. Our Registration Statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC on August 11, 2016.
The Offering Period is the time frame in which we raise capital contributions from investors through the sale of our Units. As
such, we expect that during our Offering Period a substantial portion of our cash in-flows will be from financing activities.
The Operating Period is the time frame in which we acquire equipment under lease or enter into other equipment financing transactions.
During this time period we anticipate that a substantial portion of our cash out-flows will be for investing activities. We believe
that the cash in-flows will be sufficient to finance our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.  

Financing
Activities    

Cash
provided by financing activities for the period ended September 30, 2016 was $1,670,628 and was primarily due to subscriptions
received in advance from our investors.  

Distributions    

During
our Operating Period, we intend to pay cash distributions on a quarterly basis to our Limited Partners at 1.5% per quarter, of
each Limited Partner s capital contribution (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited Partner). The amount
and rate of cash distributions could vary and are not guaranteed.  

Commitments
and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions    

Commitment
and Contingencies   

Our
income, losses and distributions will be allocated 99% to our Limited Partners and 1% to our General Partner until the Limited
Partners have received total distributions equal to each Limited Partners  capital contribution plus an 8%, compounded annually,
cumulative return on each Limited Partners  capital contribution. After such time, income, losses and distributions will
be allocated 80% to our Limited Partners and 20% to our General Partner.  

In
the normal course of business, we will enter into contracts of various types, including lease contracts, contracts for the sale
or purchase of lease assets, and management contracts. It is prevalent industry practice for most contracts of any significant
value to include provisions that each of the contracting parties, in addition to assuming liability for breaches of the representations,
warranties, and covenants that are part of the underlying contractual obligations, to also assume an obligation to indemnify and
hold the other contractual party harmless for such breaches, and for harm caused by such party s gross negligence and willful
misconduct, including, in certain instances, certain costs and expenses arising from the contract. Generally, to the extent these
contracts are performed in the ordinary course of business under the reasonable business judgment of our General Partner and our
Investment Manager, no liability will arise as a result of these provisions. Should any such indemnification obligation become
payable, we would separately record and/or disclose such liability in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Transactions   

None.  

Contractual
Obligations   

During
our Operating Period, we pay cash distributions on a quarterly basis to our Limited Partners at 1.5% per quarter, of each Limited
Partners  capital contribution (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited Partner). The amount and rate of cash
distributions could vary and are not guaranteed.  

Subsequent
Events    

On
October 6, 2016, the Partnership funded a finance lease facility of $680,020 for Apple computers to a private school in New
York City. The finance lease requires 39 monthly payments of $17,402. On October 6, 2016, the lessee made an advanced
rental payment of $102,002. The lease is secured by ownership of the equipment.  

On
October 18, 2016, the Partnership funded a lease facility of $318,882 for 16 pizza ovens to five separate lessees. Each lease
has a 36 month term with various monthly payments. The lease is secured by ownership of the equipment.  

On October 21, 2016,
the Partnership funded a finance lease of $357,020 for an assortment of school furniture and kitchen equipment to a school in
New Jersey. The finance lease requires 36 monthly payments of $11,647 with the first and last payments due in advance.
The lease is secured by a first position lien against the equipment.

4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures   

In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our General Partner
and Investment Manager carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the management of our General
Partner and Investment Manager, including its Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this Report pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on the foregoing evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
concluded that our General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

In
designing and evaluating our General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures, our General
Partner and Investment Manager recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our
General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable
assurance standards. Disclosure controls and procedures cannot detect or prevent all error and fraud. Some inherent limitations
in disclosure controls and procedures include costs of implementation, faulty decision-making, simple error and mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override
of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all anticipated and unanticipated
future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with
established policies or procedures.  

Evaluation
of internal control over financial reporting   

Our
General Partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of condensed
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Partnership; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of condensed financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Partnership are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Partnership; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership s assets that
could have a material effect on the condensed financial statements.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Our
General Partner and our Investment Manager have assessed the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in  Internal Control Integrated Framework.   

Based
on their assessment, our General Partner and our Investment Manager believe that, as of September 30, 2016, its internal control
over financial reporting is effective.  

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting   

There
were no additional material changes in our General Partner s or our Investment Manager s internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
their internal control over financial reporting.
