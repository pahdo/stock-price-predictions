 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Nature of Operations and Basis
                                         of Presentation    

Emclaire Financial Corp (the Corporation)
is a Pennsylvania corporation and the holding company of The Farmers National Bank of Emlenton (the Bank) and Emclaire Settlement
Services, LLC (the Title Company). The Corporation provides a variety of financial services to individuals and businesses through
its offices in Western Pennsylvania. Its primary deposit products are checking, savings and term certificate accounts and its
primary lending products are residential and commercial mortgages, commercial business loans and consumer loans. 

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, the Bank and the Title Company. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements for the interim periods include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, which are necessary,
in the opinion of management, to fairly reflect the Corporation s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Additionally, these consolidated financial statements for the interim periods have been prepared in accordance with instructions
for the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC s) Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and therefore do not
include all information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). For further information,
refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, as contained
in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC. 

The balance sheet at December 31,
2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all the information and footnotes
required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 

The preparation of financial statements,
in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The results of operations for interim
quarterly or year-to-date periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year or any
other period. Certain amounts previously reported may have been reclassified to conform to the current year s financial
statement presentation. 

2.    Mergers and Acquisitions    

On April 30, 2016, the Corporation
completed its acquisition of United American Savings Bank (United American) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of December 30, 2015, by and among the Corporation, the Bank and United American (the Merger Agreement).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Corporation acquired United American through a reverse merger of a newly created, wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Bank into United American. Immediately after the merger, United American merged with and into The Farmers National
Bank of Emlenton, with The Farmers National Bank of Emlenton being the surviving bank. At December 31, 2015, United American had
reported assets of $89.3 million. The Corporation acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of United American for
cash consideration of $13.2 million ($42.67 per share). 

The acquisition expanded the Corporation s
franchise into contiguous markets and increased the Corporation s consolidated total assets, loans and deposits. 

The assets and liabilities of United
American were recorded on the Corporation s consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair value as of April 30, 2016,
and their results of operations have been included in the consolidated income statement since such date. 

2.    Mergers and Acquisitions (continued)    

Included in the purchase price was
goodwill and a core deposit intangible of $6.6 million and $232,000, respectively. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and is the result of expected operational synergies and other factors.
This goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill will not be amortized, but will be measured annually
for impairment or more frequently if circumstances require. The core deposit intangible will be amortized over a weighted average
estimated life of ten years using the double declining balance method. Core deposit intangible expense projected for the succeeding
five years beginning 2016 is estimated to be $31,000, $40,000, $32,000, $26,000 and $20,000 per year, respectively, and $83,000
in total for years after 2020. 

While the Corporation believes that
the accounting for the acquisition is complete, accounting guidance allows for adjustments to goodwill for a period of up to one
year after the acquisition date for information that becomes available that reflects circumstances at the acquisition date. The
following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed: 

The fair value of loans was determined
using discounted cash flows. The book balance of the loans at the time of the acquisition was $66.1 million before considering
United American s allowance for loan losses, which was not carried over. The fair value disclosed above reflects a credit-related
adjustment of $(927,000) and an adjustment for other factors of $982,000. Loans evidencing credit deterioration since origination
(purchased credit impaired loans) included in loans receivable were immaterial. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, costs related to the acquisition totaled $401,000 including legal fees, system conversion costs and other costs of $194,000,
$132,000 and $75,000, respectively. 

3.    Issuance of Common Stock     

On June 10, 2015, the Corporation
sold 350,000 shares of common stock, par value of $1.25 per share, in a private offering to accredited individual and institutional
investors at $23.50 per share. The Corporation realized $8.2 million in proceeds from the offering, net of $63,000 of direct costs
relating to the offering. 

4.    Participation in the Small
                                         Business Lending Fund (SBLF) of the U.S. Treasury Department (U.S. Treasury)     

On August 18, 2011, the Corporation
entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) with the U.S. Treasury Department, pursuant to which the Corporation
issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury 10,000 shares of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (Series B Preferred
Stock), having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $10.0 million, pursuant to the U.S. Treasury s
SBLF program. On September 17, 2013, with the approval of the Corporation s primary federal banking regulator, the Corporation
redeemed 5,000 shares, or 50%, of its Series B Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury at an aggregate redemption price of $5.0
million, plus accrued but unpaid dividends. On September 30, 2015, the Corporation redeemed the remaining 5,000 shares of its
Series B Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury at an aggregate redemption price of $5.0 million, plus accrued but unpaid dividends.
Following this redemption, the Corporation does not have any Series B Preferred Stock outstanding. 

5.    Earnings
                                         per Common Share  

Basic earnings per common share
(EPS) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares
for assumed issuance of restricted stock and shares issued under stock options. 

The factors used in the Corporation s
earnings per common share computation follow: 

6.    Securities  

The following table summarizes the
Corporation s securities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The following table summarizes scheduled
maturities of the Corporation s debt securities as of September 30, 2016. Expected maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are not due at a single maturity and are shown separately. 

6.    Securities (continued)  

Information pertaining to securities
with gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, aggregated by investment category and length of time
that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position are included in the table below: 

Gains on sales of available for
sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30 were as follows: 

Management evaluates securities
for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic, market or other conditions
warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less
than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic
conditions and (4) whether the Corporation has the intent to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell
the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Corporation intends to sell an impaired security, or if it is
more likely than not the Corporation will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, the Corporation records
an other-than-temporary loss in an amount equal to the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost. Otherwise, only
the credit portion of the estimated loss on debt securities is recognized in earnings, with the other portion of the loss recognized
in other comprehensive income. For equity securities determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the entire amount of impairment
is recognized through earnings. 

6.    Securities (continued)  

There were two equity securities
in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2016, both of which were in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months.
Equity securities owned by the Corporation consist of common stock of various financial service providers. The investment security
is in unrealized loss positions as a result of recent market volatility. The Corporation does not invest in these securities with
the intent to sell them for a profit in the near term. For investments in equity securities, in addition to the general factors
mentioned above for determining whether the decline in market value is other-than-temporary, the analysis of whether an equity
security is other-than-temporarily impaired includes a review of the profitability, capital adequacy and other relevant information
available to determine the financial position and near term prospects of each issuer. The results of analyzing the aforementioned
metrics and financial fundamentals suggest recovery of amortized cost as the sector improves. Based on that evaluation, and given
that the Corporation s current intention is not to sell any impaired security and it is more likely than not it will not
be required to sell this security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Corporation does not consider the equity
security with an unrealized loss as of September 30, 2016 to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 

There were 29 debt securities in
an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2016, of which 11 were in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months.
Of these 29 securities, 19 were government-backed collateralized mortgage obligations, 4 were corporate securities, 3 were U.S.
government sponsored entity and agency securities and 3 were state and political subdivision securities. The unrealized losses
associated with these securities were not due to the deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer that would likely result
in the non-collection of contractual principal and interest, but rather have been caused by a rise in interest rates from the
time the securities were purchased. Based on that evaluation and other general considerations, and given that the Corporation s
current intention is not to sell any impaired securities and it is more likely than not it will not be required to sell these
securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Corporation does not consider the debt securities with unrealized
losses as of September 30, 2016 to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 

7.    Loans Receivable and Related Allowance for Loan Losses  

The Corporation s
loans receivable as of the respective dates are summarized as follows: 

Included in total loans above are
net deferred costs of $1.3 million and $835,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

An allowance for loan losses (ALL)
is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses from the loan portfolio. The ALL is based on management s continuing evaluation
of the risk characteristics and credit quality of the loan portfolio, assessment of current economic conditions, diversification
and size of the portfolio, adequacy of collateral, past and anticipated loss experience and the amount of nonperforming loans. 

7.    Loans Receivable and Related Allowance for Loan Losses
(continued)  

Management reviews the loan portfolio
on a quarterly basis using a defined, consistently applied process in order to make appropriate and timely adjustments to the
ALL. When information confirms all or part of specific loans to be uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged off against
the ALL. 

The following table details activity
in the ALL and the recorded investment by portfolio segment based on impairment method: 

7.    Loans Receivable and Related Allowance for Loan Losses
(continued)  

The allowance for loan losses is
based on estimates and actual losses may vary from current estimates. Management believes that the granularity of the homogeneous
pools and the related historical loss ratios and other qualitative factors, as well as the consistency in the application of assumptions,
result in an ALL that is representative of the risk found in the components of the portfolio at any given date. 

At September 30, 2016, there was
no allowance for loan losses allocated to loans acquired in the April 2016 merger with United American. 

The following table presents impaired
loans by class, segregated by those for which a specific allowance was required and those for which a specific allowance was not
necessary as of September 30, 2016:

loans by class, segregated by those for which a specific allowance was required and those for which a specific allowance was not
necessary as of December 31, 2015: 

7.    Loans Receivable and Related Allowance for Loan Losses
(continued)  

The following table presents impaired
loans by class, segregated by those for which a specific allowance was required and those for which a specific allowance was not
necessary as of September 30, 2015: 

Unpaid principal balance includes
any loans that have been partially charged off but not forgiven. Accrued interest is not included in the recorded investment in
loans presented above or in the tables that follow based on the amounts not being material. 

7.    Loans Receivable and Related Allowance for Loan Losses
(continued)  

Troubled debt restructurings
(TDR).   The Corporation has certain loans that have been modified in order to maximize collection of loan balances. If,
for economic or legal reasons related to the customer s financial difficulties, management grants a concession compared
to the original terms and conditions of the loan that it would not have otherwise considered, the modified loan is classified
as a TDR. Concessions related to TDRs generally do not include forgiveness of principal balances. The Corporation generally does
not extend additional credit to borrowers with loans classified as TDRs. 

At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Corporation had $390,000 and $835,000, respectively, of loans classified as TDRs, which are included in impaired
loans above. The Corporation had allocated $20,000 and $63,000 of specific allowance for these loans at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. 

During the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation modified one home equity loan with a recorded investment of $10,000 due to a
bankruptcy order. At September 30, 2016, the Corporation did not have any allowance for loan losses allocated to this specific
loan. The modification did not have a material impact on the Corporation s income statement during the periods. During the
three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Corporation did not modify any loans as TDRs. 

A loan is considered to be in payment
default once it is 30 days contractually past due under the modified terms. During the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016, there was a default on one $10,000 home equity loan within 12 months following modification. The default did not have
a material impact on the Corporation s income statement during the periods. During the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2015, there was a default on one $90,000 residential mortgage loan within 12 months following modification. The
default did not have a material impact on the Corporation s income statement during the periods. 

Credit Quality Indicators.
  Management categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service
their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and
current economic trends, among other factors. 

Commercial real estate and commercial
business loans not identified as impaired are evaluated as risk rated pools of loans utilizing a risk rating practice that is
supported by a quarterly special asset review. In this review process, strengths and weaknesses are identified, evaluated and
documented for each criticized and classified loan and borrower, strategic action plans are developed, risk ratings are confirmed
and the loan s performance status is reviewed. 

Management has determined certain
portions of the loan portfolio to be homogeneous in nature and assigns like reserve factors for the following loan pool types:
residential real estate, home equity loans and lines of credit, and consumer installment and personal lines of credit. 

The reserve allocation for risk
rated loan pools is developed by applying the following factors: 

Historic : Management utilizes
a computer model to develop the historical net charge-off experience which is used to formulate the assumptions employed in the
migration analysis applied to estimate losses in the portfolio. Outstanding balance and charge-off information are input into
the model and historical loss migration rate assumptions are developed to apply to pass, special mention, substandard and doubtful
risk rated loans. A twelve-quarter rolling weighted-average is utilized to estimate probable incurred losses in the portfolios. 

Qualitative : Qualitative
adjustment factors for pass, special mention, substandard and doubtful ratings are developed and applied to risk rated loans to
allow for: quality of lending policies and procedures; national and local economic and business conditions; changes in the nature
and volume of the portfolio; experiences, ability and depth of lending management; changes in trends, volume and severity of past
due, nonaccrual and classified loans and loss and recovery trends; quality of loan review systems; concentrations of credit and
other external factors. 

7.    Loans Receivable and Related Allowance for Loan Losses
(continued)  

Management uses the following definitions
for risk ratings: 

Pass : Loans classified as
pass typically exhibit good payment performance and have underlying borrowers with acceptable financial trends where repayment
capacity is evident. These borrowers typically would have a sufficient cash flow that would allow them to weather an economic
downturn and the value of any underlying collateral could withstand a moderate degree of depreciation due to economic conditions. 

Special Mention : Loans classified
as special mention are characterized by potential weaknesses that could jeopardize repayment as contractually agreed. These loans
may exhibit adverse trends such as increasing leverage, shrinking profit margins and/or deteriorating cash flows. These borrowers
would inherently be more vulnerable to the application of economic pressures. 

Substandard : Loans classified
as substandard exhibit weaknesses that are well-defined to the point that repayment is jeopardized. Typically, the Corporation
is no longer adequately protected by both the apparent net worth and repayment capacity of the borrower. 

Doubtful : Loans classified
as doubtful have advanced to the point that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently ascertainable facts,
conditions and value, is highly questionable or improbable. 

The following table presents the
classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the aggregate pass and the criticized categories of special mention, substandard and
doubtful within the Corporation s internal risk rating system as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

7.    Loans Receivable and Related Allowance for Loan Losses
(continued)  

Management further monitors the
performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio by analyzing the age of the portfolio as determined by the length of time
a recorded payment is past due. The following table presents the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the aging categories
of performing loans and nonperforming loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The following table presents the
Corporation s nonaccrual loans by aging category as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

8.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

The following table summarizes the
Corporation s acquired goodwill and intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Goodwill resulted from four acquisitions.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recorded $6.6 million of goodwill related to the acquisition
of United American (see Note 2). Goodwill represents the excess of the total purchase price paid for the acquisitions over the
fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, net of the fair value of the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but
is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Corporation
has selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded during
2015 or in the first nine months of 2016. 

The core deposit intangible asset,
resulting from two acquisitions, is amortized using the double declining balance method over a weighted average estimated life
of the related deposits and is not estimated to have a significant residual value. During the three and nine month periods ending
September 30, 2016, the Corporation recorded intangible amortization expense totaling $60,000 and $165,000, respectively, compared
to $49,000 and $146,000, respectively, for the same periods in 2015. Core deposit intangible expense projected for the succeeding
five years beginning 2016 is estimated to be $226,000, $235,000, $196,000, $26,000 and $20,000 per year, respectively, and $83,000
in total for years after 2020. 

9.    Stock Compensation Plans  

In April 2014, the Corporation adopted
the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan), which is shareholder approved and permits the grant of restricted stock awards
and options to its directors, officers and employees for up to 176,866 shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, 75,483
shares of restricted stock and 88,433 stock options remain available for issuance under the plan. 

In addition, the Corporation s
2007 Stock Incentive Plan and Trust (the 2007 Plan), which is shareholder approved, permits the grant of restricted stock awards
and options to its directors, officers and employees for up to 177,496 shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, 1,313
shares of restricted stock and 45,283 stock options remain available for issuance under the plan. 

Incentive stock options, non-incentive
or compensatory stock options and share awards may be granted under the Plans. The exercise price of each option shall at least
equal the market price of a share of common stock on the date of grant and have a contractual term of ten years. Options shall
vest and become exercisable at the rate, to the extent and subject to such limitations as may be specified by the Corporation.
Compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions must be recognized in the financial statements with measurement
based upon the fair value of the equity instruments issued. 

9.    Stock Compensation Plans (continued)  

A summary of option activity under
the Plans as of September 30, 2016, and changes during the period then ended is presented below: 

A summary of the status of the Corporation s
nonvested restricted stock awards as of September 30, 2016, and changes during the period then ended is presented below: 

For the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recognized $44,000 and $154,000, respectively, in stock compensation expense, compared
to $42,000 and $150,000, respectively, for the same periods in 2015. As of September 30, 2016, there was $237,000 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plans. That cost is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years. It is the Corporation s policy to issue shares on the vesting
date for restricted stock awards. Unvested restricted stock awards do not receive dividends declared by the Corporation. 

Fair value is the exchange price
that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market
for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels
of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. 

Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted)
for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Corporation has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 : Significant other
observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets
that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3 : Significant unobservable
inputs that reflect the Corporation s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
an asset or liability. 

An asset or liability s level
is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The Corporation used the following
methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: 

Cash and cash equivalents 
  The carrying value of cash and due from banks and interest earning deposits with banks approximates fair value and are
classified as Level 1. 

10.    Fair Value (continued)  

Securities available for sale
   The fair value of all investment securities are based upon the assumptions market participants would use in pricing
the security. If available, investment securities are determined by quoted market prices (Level 1). Level 1 includes U.S. Treasury,
federal agency securities and certain equity securities. For investment securities where quoted market prices are not available,
fair values are calculated based on market prices on similar securities (Level 2). Level 2 includes U.S. Government sponsored
entities and agencies, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, state and political subdivision securities
and corporate debt securities. For investment securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available,
fair values are calculated by using unobservable inputs (Level 3) and may include certain equity securities held by the Corporation.
The Level 3 equity security valuations were supported by an analysis prepared by the Corporation which relies on inputs such as
the security issuer s publicly attainable financial information, multiples derived from prices in observed transactions
involving comparable businesses and other market, financial and nonfinancial factors. 

Loans    The fair value
of loans receivable was estimated based on the discounted value of the future cash flows using the current rates being offered
for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. 

Impaired loans    At
the time a loan is considered impaired, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans carried at fair value
generally receive a specific allowance for loan losses. For collateral dependent loans, fair value is commonly based on real estate
appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales
and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences
between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level
3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book
value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical
knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the
client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3 classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for
additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of impaired loans measured using the
fair value of collateral consisted of loan balances of $59,000, net of a valuation allowance of $1,000, compared to loan balances
of $643,000, net of a valuation allowance of $47,000, at December 31, 2015. There was no additional provision for loan losses
recorded for impaired loans during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. There was $0 and $235,000 of additional
provision for loan losses recorded for impaired loans during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015. 

Other real estate owned (OREO)
   Assets acquired through or instead of foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired,
establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs
to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. Management s ongoing review of appraisal information
may result in additional discounts or adjustments to the valuation based upon more recent market sales activity or more current
appraisal information derived from properties of similar type and/or locale. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically
result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had no
OREO measured at fair value. At December 31, 2015, OREO measured at fair value less costs to sell had a net carrying amount of
$13,000, which consisted of the outstanding balance of $22,000 less write-downs of $9,000. There was no expense recorded during
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 associated with the write-down of OREO, compared $0 and $3,000, respectively
for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015. 

10.    Fair Value (continued)  

Appraisals for both collateral-dependent
impaired loans and OREO are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers
(for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed by the Corporation. Once received, management
reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with
independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics. On an annual basis, the Corporation compares
the actual selling price of OREO that has been sold to the most recent appraisal to determine what additional adjustment should
be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value. The most recent analysis performed indicated that a discount of 10% should
be applied. 

Federal bank stock   
It is not practical to determine the fair value of federal bank stocks due to restrictions placed on its transferability. 

Deposits    The fair
value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits, checking with interest, savings and money
market accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand resulting in either a Level 1 or Level 2 classification. The fair values
of time deposits are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently
offered for deposits of similar maturities resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Borrowings    The fair
value of borrowings with the FHLB is estimated using discounted cash flows based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Accrued interest receivable and
payable    The carrying value of accrued interest receivable and payable approximates fair value. The fair value classification
is consistent with the related financial instrument. 

For assets measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

10.    Fair Value (continued)  

The Corporation s policy is
to transfer assets or liabilities from one level to another when the methodology to obtain the fair value changes such that there
are more or fewer unobservable inputs as of the end of the reporting period. During the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Corporation had no transfers between levels. The following table presents changes in Level 3 assets measured
on a recurring basis for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

For assets measured at fair value
on a non-recurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

The following table presents quantitative information

at September 30, 2016. Excluded at December 31, 2015 were two impaired residential mortgage loans totaling $140,000, an $89,000
impaired commercial real estate loan and a $250,000 impaired commercial business loan classified as TDRs which were measured using
a discounted cash flow methodology. 

10.    Fair Value (continued)  

The following table sets forth the
carrying amount and estimated fair values of the Corporation s financial instruments included in the consolidated balance
sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The Bank is subject to various regulatory
capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain
mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect
on the Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain
off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject
to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

The final rules implementing Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks (BASEL III rules) became effective for the Bank on January
1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January
1, 2019. 

Quantitative measures established
by the regulations to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following
table) of total, Tier 1 capital and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined)
and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). 

11.    Regulatory Matters (continued)  

In 2015, the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System amended its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement by increasing the policy s consolidated
assets threshold from $500 million to $1 billion. The primary benefit of being deemed a  small bank holding company 
is the exemption from the requirement to maintain consolidated regulatory capital ratios; instead, regulatory capital ratios only
apply at the subsidiary bank level. In addition, the Bank in its March 31, 2015 quarterly filing made a one-time permanent election
to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. 

On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve
Board and the FDIC approved rules that implement the  Basel III  regulatory capital reforms, as well as certain changes
required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted
assets, which is in addition to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer will be
phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, with a maximum buffer of 0.625% of risk weighted assets for 2016, 1.25%
for 2017, 1.875% for 2018 and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will result
in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Capital ratios shown for September
30, 2016 are in excess of the Basel III 2016 phase-in level for the capital conservation buffer. 

As of September 30, 2016, the most
recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action. To be categorized as well capitalized, an institution must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, common
equity Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no conditions or events since
the notification that management believes have changed the Bank s category. 

The following table sets forth certain

13.    New Accounting Standards  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standard Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  
The guidance in this update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or
enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for
example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue
to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides steps to follow to achieve the core principle.
An entity should disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative information is required
about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain
or fulfill a contract. The amendments in this update will become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. In evaluating this standard, management has determined that the majority of revenue
earned by the Company are from revenue streams not included in the scope of this standard and thus no material impact is expected
with the adoption of this standard.   

In January 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   This ASU requires
that all equity investments be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value to be recognized through net income unless
accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee. This ASU also requires
that an entity present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability
resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value
in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, this ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose
the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities and the requirement
to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial
instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public business entities. This ASU is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial
statements and disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-02,   Leases.   This ASU requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheet but recognize
expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to current accounting treatment. This ASU changes the guidance on sale-leaseback
transactions, initial direct costs and lease execution costs, and, for lessors, modifies the classification criteria and the accounting
for sales-type and direct financing leases. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim
periods therein. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after
the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU
on its financial statements and disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This ASU simplifies certain aspects of the
accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a
material impact on its financial statements and disclosures. 

13.    New Accounting Standards (continued)  

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  
This ASU significantly changes the way impairment of financial instruments is recognized by requiring immediate recognition of
estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of the financial instruments. The main provisions of the guidance
include (1) replacing the  incurred loss  approach under current GAAP with an  expected loss  model for
instruments measured at amortized cost, (2) requiring entities to record an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities rather
than reduce the carrying amount of the investments, as is required by the other-than-temporary impairment model under current GAAP,
and (3) a simplified accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. The ASU is effective for interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating
the impact of this ASU on its financial statements and disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus
of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force .  This ASU clarifies the presentation of specific types of cash flow receipts
and payments, including the payment of debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration cash payments paid
subsequent to the acquisition date and proceeds from settlement of BOLI policies. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a retrospective approach,
if practicable. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements and disclosures. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

This section discusses the consolidated financial
condition and results of operations of Emclaire Financial Corp and its wholly owned subsidiaries for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015 and should be read in conjunction with the Corporation s Annual

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION  

Total assets increased $93.1 million, or 15.5%,
to $693.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $600.6 million at December 31, 2015. This increase resulted primarily from an increase
in cash and equivalents and loans receivable of $15.3 million and $78.3 million, respectively. Total liabilities increased $90.7
million, or 16.6%, to $638.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $547.8 million at December 31, 2015, resulting primarily from a
$102.7 million increase in customer deposits, partially offset by a $12.0 million decrease in borrowed funds. Deposit growth consisted
of a $98.4 million, or 26.6%, increase in interest bearing deposits and a $4.4 million, or 3.6%, increase in noninterest-bearing
deposits. The increases in the assets and liabilities of the Corporation were primarily driven by the April 30, 2016 acquisition
of United American Savings Bank (United American). The acquisition added $66.1 million in loans receivable and $72.7 million in
customer deposits. In connection with the acquisition, the Corporation recorded goodwill of $6.6 million and a core deposit intangible
of $232,000. For more information regarding the acquisition, see Note 2 to the Corporation s consolidated financial statements
for September 30, 2016 included in Item 1 hereto. 

Stockholders  equity increased $2.4 million,
or 4.5%, to $55.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $52.8 million at December 31, 2015. Book value per common share was $25.73
at September 30, 2016, compared to $24.64 at December 31, 2015. 

At September 30, 2016, the Bank was considered
 well-capitalized  with a Tier 1 leverage ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and total
risk-based capital ratio of 7.69%, 11.48%, 11.48% and 12.68%, respectively. The Bank was also considered  well-capitalized 
at December 31, 2015 with a Tier 1 leverage ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based
capital ratio of 8.83%, 12.74%, 12.74% and 13.99%, respectively. The decrease in the capital ratios between the two respective
periods occurred as the Bank s average assets increased following the United American acquisition. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Comparison of Results for the Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

General.  Net income decreased $462,000,
or 30.4%, to $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.5 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease
was the result of a decrease in noninterest income of $367,000, and increases in the provision for loans losses and noninterest
expense of $270,000 and $567,000, respectively, partially offset by an increase in net interest income of $579,000 and a decrease
in the provision for income taxes of $163,000. 

Net interest income.  Tax equivalent
net interest income increased $555,000, or 12.1%, to $5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.6 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was attributed to an increase in tax equivalent interest income of
$957,000, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $402,000. 

Interest income.  Tax equivalent interest
income increased $957,000, or 18.1%, to $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.3 million for the same
period in 2015. This increase was attributed to increases in interest earned on loans and interest earning deposits with banks
and dividends on federal bank stocks of $1.1 million, $33,000 and $19,000, respectively, partially offset by a decreases in interest
earned on securities of $155,000. 

Tax equivalent interest earned on loans receivable
increased $1.1 million, or 23.7%, to $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.5 million for the
same period in 2015. This increase resulted from a $103.0 million, or 25.5% increase in average loans, accounting for an increase
of $1.1 million in interest income. The increase in loans receivable was primarily related to the acquisition of United American
in April 2016. Partially offsetting this favorable volume variance, the average yield on loans decreased 5 basis points to 4.35%
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, versus 4.40% for the same period in 2015. This unfavorable yield variance accounted
for a $67,000 decrease in interest income. 

Tax equivalent interest earned on securities
decreased $155,000, or 20.2%, to $612,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $767,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. This decrease resulted from a $33.6 million, or 24.4%, decrease in the average balance of securities,
accounting for a $196,000 decrease in interest income. Partially offsetting the unfavorable volume variance, the average yield
on securities increased 13 basis points to 2.34% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus 2.21% for the same period
in 2015. This favorable yield variance accounted for a $41,000 increase in interest income. 

Interest earned on deposits with banks increased
$33,000 to $48,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $15,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
This increase resulted from a $24.0 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning deposits, accounting for an increase
of $32,000 in interest income. The average yield on these accounts increased 4 basis points to 0.53% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, versus 0.49% for the same period in 2015, accounting for a $1,000 increase in interest income. 

Dividends on federal bank stocks increased
$19,000, or 63.3%, to $49,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $30,000 for the same period in 2015. This increase
was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of federal bank stocks of $1.3 million, or 52.7%, to $3.8 million compared
to $2.5 million for the same period in 2015, accounting for a $17,000 increase in interest income. Additionally, the average yield
on these assets increased 34 basis points to 5.14% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, versus 4.80% for the same period
in 2015, accounting for a $2,000 increase in interest income. 

Interest expense.  Interest expense increased
$402,000, or 58.5%, to $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $687,000 for the same period in 2015. This
increase in interest expense can be attributed to increases in interest incurred on deposits and borrowed funds of $249,000 and
$153,000, respectively. 

Interest expense incurred on deposits increased
$249,000, or 46.8%, to $781,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $532,000 for the same period in 2015.
The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $83.1 million, or 21.4%, to $470.7 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to $387.6 million for the same period in 2015 causing a $126,000 increase in interest expense. This
increase was primarily due to the acquisition of United American in April 2016. Additionally, the average cost of interest-bearing
deposits increased 12 basis points to 0.66% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 0.54% for the same period
in 2015, resulting in a $123,000 increase in interest expense. 

Interest expense incurred on borrowed funds
increased $153,000, or 98.7%, to $308,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $155,000 for the same period
in the prior year. The average balance of borrowed funds increased $16.7 million, or 81.3%, to $37.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to $20.5 million for the same period in 2015 causing a $122,000 increase in interest expense.
Additionally, the average cost of borrowed funds increased 30 basis points, or 10.0%, to 3.29% for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to 2.99% for the same period in 2015 causing a $31,000 increase in interest expense. 

Average Balance Sheet and Yield/Rate Analysis. 
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information concerning the total dollar amounts of interest income from
interest-earning assets and the resulting average yields, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities
and the resulting average costs, net interest income, interest rate spread and the net interest margin earned on average interest-earning
assets. For purposes of this table, average loan balances include nonaccrual loans and exclude the allowance for loan losses and
interest income includes accretion of net deferred loan fees. Interest and yields on tax-exempt loans and securities (tax-exempt
for federal income tax purposes) are shown on a fully tax equivalent basis. The information is based on average daily balances
during the periods presented. 

Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income. 
The following table analyzes the changes in interest income and interest expense in terms of: (1) changes in volume of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities and (2) changes in yields and rates. The table reflects the extent to which changes in
the Corporation s interest income and interest expense are attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied
by prior year rate), rate (change in rate multiplied by prior year volume) and changes attributable to the combined impact of volume/rate
(change in rate multiplied by change in volume). The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume/rate are allocated on
a consistent basis between the volume and rate variances. Changes in interest income on loans and securities reflect the changes
in interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis. 

Provision for loan losses.  The Corporation
records provisions for loan losses to maintain a level of total allowance for loan losses that management believes, to the best
of its knowledge, covers all probable incurred losses estimable at each reporting date. Management considers historical loss experience,
the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers, current conditions (particularly as they relate to markets where
the Corporation originates loans), the status of nonperforming assets, the estimated underlying value of the collateral and other
factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. 

Information pertaining to the allowance for
loan losses and nonperforming assets for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Nonperforming loans remained stable at $3.3
million at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Of the $3.3 million in nonperforming loans, $1.3 million were not past due at
September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation s
classified and criticized assets amounted to $14.8 million, or 2.1% of total assets, with $9.7 million classified as substandard
and $5.1 million identified as special mention. This compares to classified and criticized assets of $12.8 million, or 1.8% of
total assets, with $7.3 million classified as substandard and $5.5 million identified as special mention at June 30, 2016. This
increase was related to a commercial loan relationship consisting of two loans totaling $2.6 million being classified as substandard
during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

The provision for loan losses increased $270,000
to $168,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from a $102,000 recovery for the same period in the prior year. The provision
for loan losses recorded in the third quarter of 2016 reflects a level of expense that is typically experienced by the Corporation.
The $102,000 recovery recognized during the third quarter of 2015 resulted from a general improvement in economic factors and historical
loss ratios of the overall loan portfolio and the improvement of two large commercial loan relationships which previously had substantial
specific reserves allocated. 

Noninterest income.  Noninterest income
decreased $367,000, or 26.6%, to $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.4 million for the same
period in the prior year. This decrease resulted primarily from a $533,000 decrease in net gains on the sale of securities. During
the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Corporation sold certain securities to accommodate loan production and generated
$533,000 of net gains. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation did not realize any securities gains,
but did recognize $121,000 in gains on loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB). 

Noninterest expense.  Noninterest expense
increased $567,000, or 14.4%, to $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.9 million for the same
period in 2015. This increase in noninterest expense can be attributed to increases in compensation and benefits, premises and
equipment, federal deposit insurance, and other noninterest expense of $256,000, $86,000, $31,000 and $192,000, respectively. 

Compensation and employee benefits expense
increased $256,000, or 12.8%, to $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.0 million for the same
period in the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of increases in salaries, insurance benefits, payroll taxes and
retirement benefits of $172,000, $32,000, $15,000 and $13,000, respectively. The increases in compensation and employee benefits
related expenses were due primarily to the addition of the branch office in the United American acquisition in April 2016 and the
opening of the new Aspinwall branch office in August 2016. 

Premises and equipment expense increased $86,000,
or 13.3%, to $732,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $646,000 for the same period in the prior year.
This increase was primarily the result of the two new branch offices which added $76,000 of expense for the quarter ended September
30, 2016. 

Other noninterest expense increased $192,000,
or 20.1%, to $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $956,000 for the same period in the prior year.
Contributing to the increase were operating costs of $85,000 associated with the two new branch offices and increased technology
related costs. 

The Corporation recognized $60,000 of core
deposit intangible amortization expense during the third quarter of 2016 compared to $49,000 for the same period in 2015. This
amortization relates to a branch acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2009 and the United American acquisition completed
in April 2016. Further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquisitions can be found in Note 2 to the  Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  beginning on page 6. 

Provision for income taxes . The provision
for income taxes decreased $163,000, or 35.4%, to $297,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $460,000 for
the same period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by the decrease in taxable income coupled with a decrease in the Corporation s
effective tax rate to 21.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 23.2% for the same period in the prior year. 

Comparison of Results for the Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

General.  Net income decreased $439,000,
or 13.6%, to $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.2 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease
was the result of a decrease in noninterest income of $272,000, and increases in the provision for loans losses and noninterest
expense of $201,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in net interest income of $1.1 million. 

Net interest income.  Tax equivalent
net interest income increased $1.0 million, or 7.5%, to $14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $13.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase can be attributed to an increase in tax equivalent interest income
of $1.8 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $811,000. 

Interest income.  Tax equivalent interest
income increased $1.8 million, or 11.6%, to $17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $15.9 million for the
same period in 2015. This increase can be attributed to increases in interest earned on loans and interest earning deposits with
banks and dividends on federal bank stocks of $2.3 million, $60,000 and $3,000, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in
interest earned on securities of $498,000. 

Tax equivalent interest earned on loans receivable
increased $2.3 million, or 17.1%, to $15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $13.3 million for the
same period in 2015. This increase resulted from a $80.4 million, or 20.4% increase in average loans, accounting for an increase
of $2.6 million in interest income. The increase resulted from strong loan growth during late of 2015 and the first three quarters
of 2016 and the acquisition of United American in April 2016. Partially offsetting this favorable volume variance, the average
yield on loans decreased 13 basis points to 4.39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, versus 4.52% for the same period
in 2015. This unfavorable yield variance accounted for a $370,000 decrease in interest income. 

Tax equivalent interest earned on securities
decreased $498,000, or 20.6%, to $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease resulted from a $36.8 million, or 25.2%, decrease in the average balance of securities,
accounting for a $641,000 decrease in interest income. Partially offsetting the unfavorable volume variance, the average yield
on securities increased 14 basis points to 2.36% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus 2.22% for the same period
in 2015. This favorable yield variance accounted for a $143,000 increase in interest income. 

Interest earned on deposits with banks increased
$60,000 to $110,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $50,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
This increase resulted from a $14.8 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning deposits, accounting for an increase
of $59,000 in interest income. The average yield on these accounts increased 1 basis point to 0.53% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, versus 0.52% for the same period in 2015, accounting for a $1,000 increase in interest income. 

Dividends on federal bank stocks increased
$3,000, or 2.3%, to $135,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $132,000 for the same period in 2015. This increase
was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of federal bank stocks of $1.3 million, or 54.2%, to $3.6 million compared
to $2.3 million for the same period in 2015, accounting for a $57,000 increase in interest income. This favorable variance was
partially offset by a one-time special dividend paid in the first quarter of 2015 by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. 

Interest expense. Interest expense increased
$811,000, or 38.1%, to $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.1 million for the same period in 2015.
This increase in interest expense can be attributed to increases in interest incurred on deposits and borrowed funds of $478,000
and $333,000, respectively. 

Interest expense incurred on deposits increased
$478,000, or 29.6%, to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.6 million for the same period in
2015. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 9 basis points to 0.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to 0.55% for the same period in 2015, resulting in a $292,000 increase in interest expense. Additionally, the average
balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $42.7 million, or 10.8%, to $436.6 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared to $393.9 million for the same period in 2015 causing a $186,000 increase in interest expense. In addition, average
noninterest bearing deposits increased $4.5 million, or 3.8%, to $122.1 million from $117.6 million. 

Interest expense incurred on borrowed funds
increased $333,000, or 64.8%, to $847,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $514,000 for the same period
in the prior year. The average balance of borrowed funds increased $17.5 million, or 88.4%, to $37.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to $19.8 million for the same period in 2015 causing a $405,000 increase in interest expense.
Partially offsetting this unfavorable variance, the average cost of borrowed funds decreased 44 basis points, or 12.6%, to 3.04%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.48% for the same period in 2015 causing a $72,000 decrease in interest
expense. 

Average Balance Sheet and Yield/Rate Analysis. 
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information concerning the total dollar amounts of interest income from
interest-earning assets and the resulting average yields, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities
and the resulting average costs, net interest income, interest rate spread and the net interest margin earned on average interest-earning
assets. For purposes of this table, average loan balances include nonaccrual loans and exclude the allowance for loan losses and
interest income includes accretion of net deferred loan fees. Interest and yields on tax-exempt loans and securities (tax-exempt
for federal income tax purposes) are shown on a fully tax equivalent basis. The information is based on average daily balances
during the periods presented. 

Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income. 
The following table analyzes the changes in interest income and interest expense in terms of: (1) changes in volume of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities and (2) changes in yields and rates. The table reflects the extent to which changes in
the Corporation s interest income and interest expense are attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied
by prior year rate), rate (change in rate multiplied by prior year volume) and changes attributable to the combined impact of volume/rate
(change in rate multiplied by change in volume). The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume/rate are allocated on
a consistent basis between the volume and rate variances. Changes in interest income on loans and securities reflect the changes
in interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis. 

Provision for loan losses.  The Corporation
records provisions for loan losses to maintain a level of total allowance for loan losses that management believes, to the best
of its knowledge, covers all probable incurred losses estimable at each reporting date. Management considers historical loss experience,
the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers, current conditions (particularly as they relate to markets where
the Corporation originates loans), the status of nonperforming assets, the estimated underlying value of the collateral and other
factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. 

Information pertaining to the allowance for
loan losses and nonperforming assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Nonperforming loans increased $258,000 to
$3.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $3.1 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in nonperforming loans was primarily due
to a commercial real estate loan placed on nonaccrual status during the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Of the $3.3 million in nonperforming
loans, $950,000 related to one commercial loan relationship and $1.3 million were not past due at September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation s
classified and criticized assets amounted to $14.8 million, or 2.1% of total assets, with $9.7 million classified as substandard
and $5.1 million identified as special mention. This compares to classified and criticized assets of $8.0 million, or 1.3% of
total assets, with $6.9 million classified as substandard and $1.0 million identified as special mention at December 31, 2015.
This increase was related to one commercial loan relationship consisting of three loans totaling $5.0 million being identified
as special mention during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and one commercial loan relationship consisting of two loans totaling
$2.6 million being classified as substandard during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

The provision for loan losses increased $201,000,
or 74.7%, to $470,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $269,000 for the same period in 2015. The provision for
loan losses recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects a level of expense that is typically experienced by
the Corporation. The lower level of provision for loan losses recorded during the same period in 2015 resulted from a $102,000
recovery of loan losses recorded in the third quarter of 2015 following a general improvement in economic factors and historical
loss ratios of the overall loan portfolio and the improvement of two large commercial loan relationships during the third quarter
which previously had substantial specific reserves allocated.  

Noninterest income.  Noninterest income
decreased $367,000, or 26.6%, to $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.4 million for the same
period in the prior year. This decrease primarily resulted from a $533,000 decrease in net gains on the sale of securities. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation realized securities gains of $83,000, of which $81,000 related to a
balance sheet management strategy whereby securities were sold to prepay a $5.0 million FHLB long-term advance and the related
securities gains were used to offset the impact of prepayment penalties associated with the early retirement of the advance. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Corporation recorded securities gains of $533,000 related to the sale of a securities
to fund loan growth. Partially offsetting this decrease, the Corporation recognized $121,000 in net gains on the sale of loans
to the FHLB during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Noninterest expense.  Noninterest expense
increased $1.1 million, or 9.0%, to $13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11.9 million for
the same period in the prior year. This increase in noninterest expense can be attributed to increases in acquisition costs, compensation
and benefits, other noninterest expense and premises and equipment of $401,000, $362,000, $148,000 and $140,000, respectively. 

Costs related to the acquisition of United
American totaled $401,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These costs included legal fees, system conversion costs
and other costs of $194,000, $132,000 and $75,000, respectively. 

Compensation and employee benefits expense
increased $362,000, or 5.9%, to $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6.1 million for the same
period in the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of increases in salaries, insurance benefits, payroll taxes and
retirement benefits of $269,000, $54,000, $35,000 and $30,000, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in incentive expense
of $41,000. The increases in compensation and employee benefits related expenses were due primarily to the addition of the branch
office in the United American acquisition in April 2016 and the opening of the new Aspinwall branch office in August 2016. 

Premises and equipment expense increased $140,000,
or 7.1%, to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.0 million for the same period in the prior
year. This increase was primarily the result of the two new branch offices which added $130,000 of expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. 

Other noninterest expense increased $148,000,
or 5.3%, to $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.8 million for the same period in the prior
year. Included in other noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a prepayment penalty of $71,000 associated
with the early retirement of an FHLB advance. Additionally, the two new branch offices added $132,000 of expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016.  

The Corporation recognized $165,000 of core
deposit intangible amortization expense during the nine months of 2016 compared to $146,000 for the same period in 2015. This
amortization relates to a branch acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2009 and the United American bank acquisition completed
in April 2016. Further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquisitions can be found in Note 2 to the
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  included in Item 1 hereto beginning on page 6. 

Provision for income taxes . The provision
for income taxes increased $3,000 to $880,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $877,000 for the same period
in the prior year. The Corporation s effective tax rate increased to 24.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to 21.4% for the same period in the prior year. The Corporation s effective tax rate increased primarily due to
certain non-deductible acquisition related expenses. This increase was offset by a decrease in the Corporation s taxable
income. 

LIQUIDITY  

The Corporation s primary sources of
funds generally have been deposits obtained through the offices of the Bank, borrowings from the FHLB, Federal Reserve and other
correspondent banks, and amortization and prepayments of outstanding loans and maturing securities. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Corporation used its sources of funds primarily to fund loan purchases and advances and repay short term
borrowed funds. As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had outstanding loan commitments, including undisbursed loans and amounts
available under credit lines, totaling $78.3 million, and standby letters of credit totaling $126,000. 

At September 30, 2016, time deposits amounted
to $168.5 million, or 28.4% of the Corporation s total consolidated deposits, including approximately $51.5 million of which
are scheduled to mature within the next year. Management of the Corporation believes (i) it has adequate resources to fund all
of its commitments, (ii) all of its commitments will be funded as required by related maturity dates and (iii) based upon past
experience and current pricing policies, it can adjust the rates of time deposits to retain a substantial portion of maturing
liabilities if necessary. 

Aside from liquidity available from customer
deposits or through sales and maturities of securities, the Corporation has alternative sources of funds such as a term borrowing
capacity from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve s discount window. At September 30, 2016, the Corporation had borrowed funds
of $37.3 million consisting of $30.0 million of long-term FHLB advances, a $4.8 million long-term advance with a correspondent
bank and $2.5 million outstanding on a line of credit with a correspondent bank. At September 30, 2016, the Corporation s
borrowing capacity with the FHLB, net of funds borrowed and other commitments, was $189.9 million. 

Management is not aware of any
conditions, including any regulatory recommendations or requirements, which would adversely impact its liquidity or its ability
to meet funding needs in the ordinary course of business. 

RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS  

The final rules implementing the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision s (BCBS) capital guidelines for U.S. banks were approved by the FRB and FDIC. Under the final rules,
minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital
to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to
6.0%, require a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0% and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of
4.0%. A new capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital was also established above the regulatory minimum
capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets
and will increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Eligibility
criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the final rules. The final rules also revised the definition
and calculation of Tier 1 capital, Total Capital and risk-weighted assets. The phase-in period for the final rules became effective
on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the final rules  requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule to
be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. 

At September 30, 2016, the Bank exceeded all
minimum capital requirements under these capital guidelines. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The Corporation s consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow
general practices within the industry in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates
or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on
information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements
could reflect different estimates or judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, and
as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates
or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value
of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be
established or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities
at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation
adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third-party sources,
when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management
primarily though the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques. 

The most significant accounting policies followed
by the Corporation are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial
statement notes provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those
values are determined. Management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex
judgments, estimates and assumptions and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the
financial statements. Management has identified the following as critical accounting policies. 

Allowance for loan losses.   The
Corporation considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity
than its other significant accounting policies. The balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s
review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience, the size and composition of the portfolio, current
economic events and conditions and other pertinent factors, including management s assumptions as to delinquencies, recoveries
and losses. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. Among the many factors affecting the allowance for
loan losses, some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment. Although management believes its process for determining
the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses, the process includes
subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management s
estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact the Corporation s financial
condition or earnings in future periods. 

Other-than-temporary impairment .
 Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when
economic, market or other concerns warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to (1) the length of time and the extent to
which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the
market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and (4) whether the Corporation has the intent to sell the debt security
or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. 

Goodwill and intangible assets.  
Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets
acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested
for impairment at least annually. The impairment test is a two-step process that begins with an initial impairment evaluation.
If the initial evaluation suggests that an impairment of the asset value exists, the second step is to determine the amount of
the impairment. If the tests conclude that goodwill is impaired, the carrying value is adjusted and an impairment charge is recorded.
As of November 30, 2015, the required annual impairment test of goodwill was performed and management concluded that no impairment
existed as of that date. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
to their estimated residual values. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk   

Market risk for the Corporation consists primarily
of interest rate risk exposure and liquidity risk. Since virtually all of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
are at the Bank, virtually all of the interest rate risk and liquidity risk lies at the Bank level. The Bank is not subject to
currency exchange risk or commodity price risk, and has no trading portfolio, and therefore, is not subject to any trading risk.
In addition, the Bank does not participate in hedging transactions such as interest rate swaps and caps. Changes in interest rates
will impact both income and expense recorded and also the market value of long-term interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities. Interest rate risk and liquidity risk management is performed at the Bank level. Although the Bank has a diversified
loan portfolio, loans outstanding to individuals and businesses depend upon the local economic conditions in the immediate trade
area. 

One of the primary functions of the Corporation s
asset/liability management committee is to monitor the level to which the balance sheet is subject to interest rate risk. The
goal of the asset/liability committee is to manage the relationship between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, thereby
minimizing the fluctuations in the net interest margin, which achieves consistent growth of net interest income during periods
of changing interest rates. 

Interest rate sensitivity is the result of
differences in the amounts and repricing dates of the Bank s rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities. These
differences, or interest rate repricing  gap , provide an indication of the extent that the Corporation s net
interest income is affected by future changes in interest rates. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate-sensitive
assets exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate-sensitive
liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets. Generally, during a period of rising interest rates, a negative
gap would adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income. Conversely,
during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap
would adversely affect net interest income. The closer to zero that gap is maintained, generally, the lesser the impact of market
interest rate changes on net interest income. 

Assumptions about the timing and variability
of cash flows are critical in gap analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the expected
attrition of the core deposits portfolios. These assumptions are based on the Corporation s historical experience, industry
standards and assumptions provided by a federal regulatory agency, which management believes most accurately represents the sensitivity
of the Corporation s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes. As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation s
interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within one year totaled $198.4 million while the Corporation s interest-bearing
liabilities maturing or repricing within one-year totaled $182.5 million, providing an excess of interest-earning assets over
interest-bearing liabilities of $15.9 million. At September 30, 2016, the percentage of the Corporation s assets to liabilities
maturing or repricing within one year was 108.7%. 

For more information, see  Market Risk
Management  in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures    

The Corporation maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Corporation s Exchange
Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation s management, including its Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based
on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rule 13a-15(e). 

As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s management, including the
Corporation s CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation s disclosure controls
and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the Corporation s CEO and CFO concluded that the Corporation s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. There have been no significant changes in the Corporation s internal controls or
in other factors that could significantly affect the internal controls subsequent to the date the Corporation completed its evaluation. 

There has been no change made in
the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
