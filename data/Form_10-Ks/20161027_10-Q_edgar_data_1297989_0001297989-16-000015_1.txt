  1. Organization and Basis of Presentation 
  Organization 
  ExlService Holdings, Inc. ( ExlService Holdings ) is organized as a corporation under the laws of the state of Delaware. ExlService Holdings, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ), is a leading Operations Management and Analytics company that helps businesses enhance growth and profitability. Using its proprietary platforms, methodologies and tools the Company looks deeper to help companies improve global operations, enhance data-driven insights, increase customer satisfaction, and manage risk and compliance. The Company s clients are located principally in the U.S. and the U.K. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (of a normal and recurring nature) that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of such statements for the interim periods presented. The unaudited consolidated statements of income for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year or for any subsequent period. 
  Effective for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015, the Company merged   two   of its operating segments (Operations Consulting and Finance Transformation, previously part of the Analytics and Business Transformation reportable segment) into the Consulting operating segment to reflect recent organizational changes. The Company has also revised its reportable segments to reflect management s focus on the Analytics operating segment. All other operating segments have been aggregated into the Operations Management reportable segment. 
    The Company s reportable segments are as follows: 
             
    Operations Management, and  
                
    Analytics 
     The segment information for all prior periods presented herein has been restated to conform to the current presentation. This change in segment presentation does not affect the Company s consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. 
   
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  (a) Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of ExlService Holdings and all of its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The non-controlling interest represents the minority partner s interest in the operations of ExlService Colombia S.A.S. ("Exl Colombia") and the profits associated with the minority partner s interest in those operations, in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income, respectively. The non-controlling interests in such operations for all the periods presented were insignificant and are included under general and administrative expenses in the unaudited consolidated statements of income. 
  (b) Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited consolidated statements of income during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management s best assessment of the current business environment, actual results may be different from those estimates. The significant estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful receivables, service tax receivables, assets and obligations related to employee

benefit plans, deferred tax valuation allowances, income-tax uncertainties and other contingencies, valuation of derivative financial instruments, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization periods, purchase price allocation, recoverability of long-term assets including goodwill and intangibles, and estimates to complete the fixed price contracts.

  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consists of the following: 

(e) Non-current liabilities 
  Non-current liabilities consists of the following: 

(f) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of amortization of actuarial gain/(loss) on retirement benefits and changes in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. In addition, the Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC topic 815, "Derivatives and Hedging" ("ASC 815"). Changes in the fair values of contracts that are deemed effective are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the settlement of those contracts. The balances as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 are as follows:

(g) Other Income, net 
  Other income, net consists of the following: 

* Includes unrealized gain of   $1,971   and   $4,955   on investments carried under ASC topic 825, "Financial Instruments" ("ASC 825"), fair value option for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1,419   and   $2,179  , respectively, for the   three and nine   months ending   September 30, 2015  . 
  ** The Company recognized   $4,060   of other income during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the changes in the fair value of the earn-out consideration related to its acquisition of RPM Direct, LLC and RPM Data Solutions, LLC (the "RPM acquisition"). 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions of the Company. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either one of two methods: (i) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU No. 2014-09; or (ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU No. 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU No. 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption and the implementation approach to be used, changes to its accounting system and processes, and additional disclosure requirements that may be necessary. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU No. 2016-02 requires the identification of arrangements that should be accounted for as leases by lessees. In general, for lease arrangements exceeding a twelve month term, these arrangements must now be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee. Under ASU No. 2016-02, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation will be recorded for all leases, whether operating or financing, while the income statement will reflect lease expense for operating leases and amortization/interest expense for financing leases. The balance sheet amount recorded for existing leases at the date of adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 must be calculated using the applicable incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption. In addition, ASU No. 2016-02 requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and the implementation approach to be used.

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05, Derivatives and Hedging: Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships, which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity has the option to apply ASU No. 2016-05 on either a prospective basis or a modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-05 will not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). ASU No. 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718). ASU No. 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendment should be applied through a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The amendments apply to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230 . The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they provide guidance for each of the eight issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods and should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements, including the implementation approach to be used. 
   
  3. Earnings Per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares plus the potentially dilutive effect of common stock equivalents issued and outstanding at the reporting date, using the treasury stock method. Stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units that are anti-dilutive are excluded from the computation of weighted average shares outstanding.

4. Segment Information 
  The Company's operating segments are significant strategic business units that align its products and services with how it manages its business, approaches key markets and interacts with its clients.  Effective for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015, the Company merged   two   of its operating segments (Operations Consulting and Finance Transformation, previously part of the Analytics and Business Transformation reportable segment) into the Consulting operating segment to reflect recent organizational changes. The Company has also revised its reportable segments to reflect management s focus on the Analytics operating segment. All the other operating segments have been aggregated into the Operations Management reportable segment.  
  Our current reportable segments are as follows: 
             
    Operations Management 
                
    Analytics 
     The Company has restated the segment information for all prior periods presented herein to conform to the current presentation. This change in segment presentation does not affect the Company's consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. The Company's recent acquisitions of Liss Systems Limited and IQR Consulting Inc. are classified within the Operations Management and Analytics segments, respectively. (see Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained herein) 
  The chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) generally reviews operating segment revenues and cost of revenues. The Company does not allocate and therefore the CODM does not evaluate operating expenses, foreign exchange gain/loss and other income/loss, net and income taxes by segment. The Company s operating assets are shared by multiple segments. The Company manages assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, and therefore asset information and capital expenditures by operating segment are not presented.

5. Business Combination, Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  a) Liss Systems Limited 
  On July 1, 2016, the Company together with its subsidiary ExlService (UK) Limited ("Exl UK"), entered into a share purchase agreement (the  Liss Agreement ) for the purchase of Liss Systems Limited ("Liss").  
  Pursuant to the Liss Agreement, Exl UK purchased all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Liss from the Liss shareholders for cash consideration of   $5,202  , including negative working capital adjustments of   $603  . A portion of the purchase consideration otherwise payable was placed into escrow as security for the post-closing indemnification obligations under the Liss Agreement. 
  The Company also issued   33,459   shares of restricted common stock with an aggregate fair value of   $1,754   to certain key employees of Liss, each of whom accepted employment positions with the Company upon consummation of the combination. The fair value of these grants will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. 
  Liss, now a subsidiary of the Company, is a provider of policy administration solutions for the life and pensions industry, combining both depth of life industry knowledge with expertise in the design and delivery of core system solutions. Liss s flagship "LISSIA" platform includes multi-channel interfaces, underwriting, workflow engines, and document production modules to

automate new policy     issuance and simplify policy administration. With its  flexible architecture, LISSIA is used for both traditional and unit-linked life and investment products. 
  Liss s technology platform combined with EXL platforms  such as LifePRO        will automate key customer processes from new business to policy administration with very little human interactions. The acquisition enables expansion of the Company s solution set for the insurance market, and is expected to strengthen EXL s end-to-end offering and bolster its position as a leader in the insurance industry. Accordingly, the Company paid a premium for the acquisition which is being reflected in the goodwill recognized from the purchase price allocation of the total consideration paid by the Company. 
  The Company has preliminarily allocated the purchase price to the net tangible and intangible assets based on their fair values as set forth below: 

The amount of goodwill recognized from the Liss acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. 
  The customer relationships, developed technology and trade names and trademarks intangibles from the Liss acquisition are being amortized over a useful life of   eight  ,   ten   and   five   years, respectively. 
    
  b) IQR Consulting Inc. 
  On September 1, 2016, the Company's subsidiary, ExlService.com, LLC ("EXL LLC"), entered into a share purchase agreement (the  IQR Agreement ) for the purchase of IQR Consulting Inc. ("IQR").  
  Pursuant to the IQR Agreement, Exl LLC has purchased all of the issued and outstanding share capital of IQR from the IQR shareholders for an initial cash consideration of   $5,052   (including a working capital adjustment of   $652  ) and contingent cash consideration of   $500   to be paid in the event of the renewal of a key client contract. A portion of the purchase consideration otherwise payable was placed into escrow as security for post-closing working capital adjustments and the indemnification obligations under the IQR Agreement. 
  The Company also issued   21,987   restricted stock units with an aggregate fair value of   $1,125   to certain key employees of IQR, each of whom accepted employment positions with the Company upon consummation of the combination. The fair value of these grants will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. 
  IQR, now a subsidiary of the Company, is a U.S.-based provider of marketing and risk analytics solutions to super-regional banks and credit unions. IQR specializes in data analytics and strategic consulting services. IQR s industry focus aligns well with the Company's Analytics strengths and the Company anticipates the acquisition will bring even more value to its clients by enhancing customer satisfaction, increasing revenue growth and minimizing risk. The acquisition furthers penetration into super-regional banks, as well as the underserved credit union market, which we expect will increase the amount of business impact that is delivered to the Company's clients. Accordingly, the Company paid a premium for the acquisition, which is reflected in the goodwill recognized from the purchase price allocation of the total consideration paid by the Company.

The Company has preliminarily allocated the purchase price to the net tangible and intangible assets based on their fair values as set forth below: 

The amount of goodwill recognized from the IQR acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. 
  The customer relationships from the IQR acquisition are being amortized over the weighted average useful life of   eight   years. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized   $403   of acquisition related costs for its Liss and IQR acquisitions. Such amounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the unaudited consolidated statements of income. The Company s results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes revenues of   $1,098   from its Liss and IQR acquisitions, since the date on which these acquisitions were consummated. It is not practicable to disclose the net earnings since management does not allocate or evaluate operating expenses and income taxes to its subsidiaries. 
  Under ASC topic 805,  Business Combinations,  the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired may change for a period of up to one year from the date of the acquisition. The Company s purchase accounting as of September 30, 2016 was incomplete and the Company expects to complete its valuation of the tangible assets, intangible assets and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date during the fourth quarter of 2016. Accordingly, the Company may adjust the amounts recorded as of September 30, 2016 to reflect the final valuations of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed. 
  Goodwill

The remaining weighted average life of intangible assets was   6.0 years   for customer relationships,   5.1 years   for developed technology,   5.8 years   for trade names and trademarks excluding indefinite life trade names and trademarks,   2.7 years   for leasehold benefits and   2.8 years   for non-compete agreements.

6. Fair Value Measurements 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 
  The following table sets forth the Company s assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  . The table excludes accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses for which fair values approximate their carrying amounts. 

* Includes short-term investments carried on fair value option under ASC 825 of   $103,069   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Derivative Financial Instruments:   The Company s derivative financial instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on independent sources including highly rated financial institutions and are classified as Level 2. See Note 7 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained herein for further details on Derivatives and Hedge Accounting. 
  Fair value of earn-out consideration:   The fair value measurement of earn-out consideration is determined using Level 3 inputs. The Company s earn-out consideration as of December 31, 2015 represents a component of the total purchase consideration for the March 2015 RPM acquisition. The measurement is calculated using unobservable inputs based on the Company s own assessment of achievement of certain performance goals by RPM during the 2015 and 2016 calendar years. As of December 31, 2015, the Company estimated the fair value of the earn out consideration to be   $4,060  , utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company re-estimated its earn-out liability utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation based on its assessment of the achievement of the performance goals of RPM during calendar year 2016 and accordingly reduced the liability to   nil   as of   September 30, 2016  . The Monte-Carlo simulation model simulates a range of possible performance levels and estimates the probabilities of the potential payouts. This model also incorporates a range of assumptions like discount rate, risk-free rate, assumed cost of debt, etc.

The Company's contingent consideration as of September 30, 2016 represents a component of total purchase consideration for the September 2016 IQR acquisition. As of September 30, 2016 the Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration as   $500  , using management's best estimate of the current probability of renewal of a key client contract. 
   
  7. Derivatives and Hedge Accounting 
  The Company uses derivative instruments and hedging transactions to mitigate exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risks associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of forward foreign exchange contracts and range forward contracts (a transaction where both a put option is purchased and a call option is sold), that are designated effective and that qualify as cash flow hedges under ASC 815. The Company had outstanding cash flow hedges totaling   $221,295   (including   $2,550   of range forward contracts) as of   September 30, 2016   and   $230,894   as of December 31, 2015. The fair value of these cash flow hedges is included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCI")on the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheet. 
   The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge its intercompany balances and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies. These derivatives do not qualify as fair value hedges under ASC No. 815. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gain/loss. The Company s primary exchange rate exposure is with the Indian Rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso. The Company also has exposure to Colombian pesos, Czech Koruna, Euro, South African ZAR and other local currencies in which it operates. Outstanding  foreign currency forward contracts amounted to   $62,198   and GBP   18,519   as of   September 30, 2016   and amounted to   $61,641   and GBP   13,256   as of December 31, 2015.  
  The Company estimates that approximately   $3,111   of net derivative gains included in AOCI could be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months based on exchange rates prevailing as of   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , the maximum outstanding term of the cash flow hedges was   forty-five months  . 
  The Company evaluates hedge effectiveness at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis. If during this time, a contract is deemed ineffective, the change in the fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of income and is included in foreign exchange gain/(loss). For hedging positions that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period, any related derivative amounts recorded in equity are reclassified to earnings. There were   no   such significant amounts of gains or losses that were reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  13. Income Taxes 
  The Company determines the tax provision for interim periods using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of annual effective tax rate, and if its estimated tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment. 
  The Company recorded income tax expense of   $5,646   and   $7,565  , respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The effective tax rate decreased from   33.3%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   26.0%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was the result of (i) higher income tax expense during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due to certain adjustments (resulting in an increase in income tax expense of approximately   $600  ), and (ii) an increase in earnings in locations with lower tax rates as well as tax incentives. 
  The Company recorded income tax expense of   $18,549   and   $19,309  , respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The effective tax rate decreased from   34.4%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   28.6%   during

the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was the result of (i) higher income tax expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to certain adjustments (resulting in an increase in income tax expense of approximately   $2,400  ) and (ii) an increase in earnings in locations with lower tax rates as well as tax incentives. The decrease in effective tax rate was partially offset by the reversal of earn-out liability of   $4,060   in other income during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   related to the Company's RPM acquisition. 
  The following table summarizes the activity related to the gross unrecognized tax benefits from January 1, 2016 through   September 30, 2016  :

goods, stores and spares consumed duty free, in the event that certain terms and conditions are not fulfilled. The Company s management believes, however, that these units have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required conditions. 
  The Company s operations centers in the Philippines are registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority ( PEZA ). The registration provides the Company with certain fiscal incentives on the import of capital goods and requires ExlService Philippines, Inc. to meet certain performance and investment criteria. The Company s management believes that these centers have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required criteria. 
  Contingencies 
  U.S. and Indian transfer pricing regulations require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be at an arm s-length price. Accordingly, the Company determines the appropriate pricing for the international transactions among its associated enterprises on the basis of a detailed functional and economic analysis involving benchmarking against transactions among entities that are not under common control. The tax authorities have jurisdiction to review this arrangement and in the event that they determine that the transfer price applied was not appropriate, the Company may incur increased tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties. The Company is currently involved in disputes with the Indian tax authorities over the application of some of its transfer pricing policies for some of its subsidiaries. Further, the Company and a U.S. subsidiary are engaged in tax litigation with the income-tax authorities in India on the issue of permanent establishment. 
  The aggregate disputed amount demanded by Indian tax authorities from the Company related to its transfer pricing issues for years ranging from tax years   2003   to   2013   and its permanent establishment issues ranging from tax years   2003   to   2007   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015   is   $20,540   and   $21,360  , respectively, of which the Company has made payments or provided a bank guarantee to the extent of   $14,563   and   $14,668  , respectively. Amounts paid as deposits in respect of such assessments aggregating to   $12,574   and   $12,665   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , respectively, are included in  Other assets  and amounts deposited for bank guarantees aggregating to   $1,989   and   $2,003   as of    September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , respectively, are included in  Restricted cash  in the non-current assets section of the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  . 
  Based on advice from its Indian tax advisors, the facts underlying the Company s position and its experience with these types of assessments, the Company believes that the probability that it will ultimately be found liable for these assessments is remote and accordingly has not accrued any amount with respect to these matters in its consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect any impact from these assessments on its future income tax expense. It is possible that the Company might receive similar orders or assessments from tax authorities for subsequent years. Accordingly even if these disputes are resolved, the Indian tax authorities may still serve additional orders or assessments. 

17. Subsequent Event 
    
  On October 21, 2016, Exl LLC purchased Datasource Consulting, LLC ("Datasource"), a Colorado limited liability company for   $18,800  , subject to a working capital adjustment. The Company also issued restricted stock at a fair value of   $4,700   to certain key employees of Datasource, each of whom accepted new employment terms as part of the consummation of the combination. Datasource is a provider of enterprise data management and business intelligence solutions.

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that align our products and services with how we manage our business, approach our key markets and interact with our clients.  Effective for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015, we merged two of our operating segments (Operations Consulting and Finance Transformation, previously part of the Analytics and Business Transformation reportable segment) into the Consulting operating segment to reflect recent organizational changes. We have also revised our reportable segments to reflect management s focus on the Analytics operating segment. All our other operating segments have been aggregated into the Operations Management reportable segment. 
  Our current reportable segments are as follows: 
             
    Operations Management, and  
                
    Analytics 
     We have restated the segment information for all prior periods presented herein to conform to the current presentation.  This change in segment presentation does not affect our consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. For further descriptions of our operating segments, see Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained herein. 
  Our global delivery network, which include highly trained industry and process specialists across the United States, Latin America, South Africa, Europe and Asia (primarily India and the Philippines), is a key asset. We have operations centers in India, the U.S., the Philippines, Bulgaria, Colombia, South Africa, Romania and the Czech Republic.  
  Consistent with our growth strategy, on July 1, 2016 and September 1, 2016, we acquired Liss Systems Limited (the "Liss acquisition") and IQR Consulting Inc. (the "IQR Acquisition"), respectively. 
  Liss is a provider of policy administration solutions for the life and pensions industry, combining both depth of life industry knowledge with expertise in the design and delivery of core system solutions. Liss s "LISSIA" platform combined with our platforms  such as LifePRO        will enable expansion of our solutions set for the insurance market, and is expected to strengthen our end-to-end offering and bolster our position as a leader in the insurance industry. 
  IQR is a U.S.-based provider of marketing and risk analytics solutions to super-regional banks and credit unions and specializes in data analytics and strategic consulting services. IQR s industry focus aligns well with our Analytics strengths and we anticipate that the acquisition will bring even more value to our clients by enhancing customer satisfaction, increasing revenue growth and minimizing risk. 
  Revenues 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had revenues of   $171.2 million   compared to revenues of   $163.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $7.7 million  , or   4.7%  . Revenues from operations management services were   $129.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $128.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Revenues from analytics services were   $41.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $35.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had revenues of   $508.7 million   compared to revenues of   $462.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $46.1 million  , or   10.0%  . Revenues from operations management services were   $388.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $376.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Revenues from analytics services were   $120.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $85.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  We serve clients mainly in the U.S. and the U.K., with these two regions generating approximately 80.1% and   16.4%  , respectively, of our total revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and approximately 79.4% and 17.3%, respectively, of our revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , these two regions generated 80.1% and   16.6%  , respectively, of our total revenues and 78.8% and 17.6%, respectively, of our total revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our total revenues from our top ten clients accounted for   41.0%   and 39.8% of our total revenues, respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our total revenues from our top ten clients accounted for   40.6%   and 41.8% of our total revenues, respectively. None of our clients accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Although we are continually increasing and diversifying our customer base, we expect in the near future that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients.

Our Business 
  Our business is divided into two reporting segments: Operations Management and Analytics. We market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by key industry verticals and cross-industry domains such as finance and accounting. Our sales and client management teams operate from the U.S., Europe and Australia. 
  Operations Management: We provide our clients with a range of operations management solutions principally in the insurance, healthcare, utilities, banking and financial services, and travel, transportation and logistics sectors, among others, as well as cross-industry operations management solutions, such as finance and accounting services. 
  Our Operations Management solutions typically involve the transfer to the Company of select business operations of a client such as claims processing, clinical operations, or financial transaction processing, after which we administer and manage the operations for our client on an ongoing basis. As part of this transfer, we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant business operations, implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the client s customers. Each client contract has different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement. 
  We have been observing a shift in industry pricing models toward transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing and other pricing models. We believe this trend will continue, and we have begun to use transaction-based, outcome-based and other pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a billing rate model to a transaction-based or other pricing model. These transaction-based pricing models place the focus on operating efficiency in order to maintain our operating margins. In addition, we have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multi-vendor relationships with regard to their outsourcing needs. We believe that the trend toward multi-vendor relationships will continue. A multi-vendor relationship allows a client to seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms from each vendor, which can result in significantly reduced operating margins from the provision of services to such client for each vendor. To the extent our large clients expand their use of multi-vendor relationships and are able to extract more favorable contract terms from other vendors, our operating margins and revenues may be reduced with regard to such clients if we are required to modify the terms of our relationships with such clients to meet competition. 
  As we increase our capabilities utilizing technology service platforms and other software-based services, we expect that revenues from such services will continue to grow in proportion to our total revenues. Revenues from annual maintenance and support contracts for our software platforms provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base and are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts. New license sales and implementation projects have a long selling cycle and it is difficult to predict the timing of when such new contracts will be signed, which may lead to fluctuations in our revenues over the short term. 
  Analytics:   Our Analytics services focus on driving improved business outcomes for our customers by generating data-driven insights across all parts of our customers  business. Our teams deliver predictive and prescriptive analytics in the areas of customer acquisition and lifecycle management, risk underwriting and pricing, operational effectiveness, credit and operational risk monitoring and governance, strategic consulting, regulatory reporting, and data management. We actively cross-sell and, where appropriate, integrate our Analytics services with Operations Management as part of a comprehensive solution for our clients.  
  We anticipate that revenues from our Analytics services will grow as we expand our service offerings and client base, both organically and through acquisitions.

Results of Operations 
  The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015:

Table of Contents  

Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
  Revenues. 

Revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $171.2 million  , up   $7.7 million   or   4.7%   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Revenue growth in Operations Management of   $1.6 million   was driven by net volume increases from our new and existing clients of $2.4 million and incremental revenue of $0.7 million from our Liss acquisition. This increase in revenues was offset by a $1.5 million impact due to the depreciation of the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Revenue growth in Analytics of   $6.1 million   was driven by net volume increases in our recurring and project based engagements from our existing and new clients of $6.6 million and incremental revenue of $0.4 million from our IQR acquisition. The increase was offset by a decrease of $0.9 million, primarily due to the depreciation of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Cost of Revenues. 

The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $8.8 million (including 
  $0.5 million of incremental employee-related costs related to our recent acquisitions). The remaining increase of $8.3 million in employee-related cost was primarily due to annual wage increases and an increase in our average headcount of personnel directly involved in providing services to our clients. We also experienced an increase in facilities, technology and other operating expenses of $0.2 million (including incremental cost of revenues of $0.1 million related to our recent acquisitions) and in reimbursable expenses of $1.1 million, resulting in a corresponding increase in revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million due to the impact of depreciation of the Indian rupee, UK pound sterling and the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Gross Profit  .   Gross profit decreased by   $0.9 million  , or   1.4%  , from   $60.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $59.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues in our consulting and platform businesses in our Operations Management segment.

Selling, General and Administrative ( SG A ) Expenses. 

The increase in SG A expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $2.0 million (including $0.5 million of incremental employee-related costs related to our recent acquisitions). The remaining increase of $1.5 million in employee-related cost was primarily due to annual wage increments and an increase in our average headcount to support increased business volume. We also experienced an increase in our other SG A expenses of $0.3 million primarily due to an increase in our facilities costs in connection with our new operations centers in India and the Philippines and legal   professional fees related to our recent acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $0.3 million due to the impact of depreciation of the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Depreciation and Amortization. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by   $0.6 million  , or   6.7%  , from   $8.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $8.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Intangible amortization expense increased by $  0.2 million  , primarily due to incremental amortization expense associated with our recent acquisitions. The increase in depreciation expense of $0.5 million was primarily due to depreciation related to our new capital investments in India, South Africa and the Philippines to support the business growth. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 million due to depreciation of the Indian rupee and the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Income from Operations.   Income from operations decreased   $3.4 million  , or   16.3%  , from   $20.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $17.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . As a percentage of revenues, income from operations decreased from   12.7%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   10.1%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Foreign Exchange Gain /( Loss).   Net foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to movement of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The average exchange rate of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar increased from 65.39 during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to 66.73 during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar increased from 0.65 during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to 0.76 during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The average exchange rate of the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar increased from 46.37 during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to 47.40 during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  We recorded a net foreign exchange gain of   $1.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Interest and Other Income, net   

  Increase in interest and dividend income was primarily due to higher cash balances in our foreign subsidiaries and higher yield on our investments during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Income Tax Expense.   The effective tax rate decreased from 33.3% during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   26.0%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was the result of (i) higher income tax expense during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due to certain adjustments (resulting in an increase in income tax expense of approximately $0.6 million) and (ii) an increase in earnings in locations with lower tax rates as well as tax incentives. 
  Net Income.   Net income increased from   $15.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $16.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in other income and foreign exchange gain of   $2.4 million   and a lower income tax expense of   $1.9 million  , partially offset by a lower income from operations of   $3.4 million  . As a percentage of revenues, net income increased marginally from   9.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   9.4%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
  Revenues. 

Revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $508.7 million  , up   $46.1 million  , or   10.0%  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Revenue growth in Operations Management of   $11.6 million   was driven by net volume increases from our new and existing clients of $17.5 million and incremental revenue of $0.7 million from our Liss acquisition. This increase in revenues was offset by a $6.6 million impact due to the depreciation of the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Revenue growth in Analytics of   $34.5 million   was driven by net volume increases in our recurring and project based engagements from our existing and new clients of $23.8 million and incremental revenue of $12.3 million from our RPM and IQR acquisitions. The increase was offset by a decrease of $1.6 million due to the depreciation of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Cost of Revenues. 

The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $30.6 million (including $1.9 million of incremental employee-related costs related to our acquisitions). The remaining increase of $28.7 million in employee-related cost was primarily due to annual wage increases and an increase in our average headcount of personnel directly involved in providing services to our clients. We also experienced an increase in facilities, technology and other operating expenses of $11.6 million (including incremental cost of revenues of $6.6 million related to our acquisitions) and in reimbursable expenses of $2.8 million, resulting in a corresponding increase in revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $9.6 million due to the impact of depreciation of the Indian rupee, the U.K pound sterling and the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Gross Profit  .   Gross profit increased by   $10.7 million  , or   6.5%  , from   $165.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $176.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to higher revenues in our Analytics services and depreciation of the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso and the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower revenues in our consulting and platform businesses in our Operations Management segment. 
  Selling, General and Administrative ( SG A ) Expenses. 

The increase in SG A expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $9.2 million (including $2.6 million of incremental employee-related costs related to our acquisitions). The remaining increase of $6.6 million in employee-related cost was primarily due to annual wage increments and an increase in our average headcount to support  increased business volume. We also experienced an increase in our other SG A expenses of $0.9 million (including $0.2 million related to our acquisitions) primarily due to an increase in our facilities costs in connection with our new operations centers in India and the Philippines and legal   professional fees related to our acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million due to the impact of depreciation of the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Depreciation and Amortization. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by   $1.8 million  , or   7.9%  , from   $23.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $25.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in amortization of intangibles of   $0.8 million   was primarily due to amortization of intangibles associated with our recent acquisitions. Further, the increase in our depreciation expense of $1.8 million is due to depreciation related to our new capital investments in India, South Africa and the Philippines to support the growth of our business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.8 million due to depreciation of the Indian rupee and the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Income from Operations.   Income from operations increased $0.5 million, or   1.2%  , from   $49.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $50.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . As a percentage of revenues, income from operations decreased from   10.7%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   9.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to higher cost of revenues in comparison to the growth in our revenues. 
  Foreign Exchange Gain /( Loss).   Net foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to movement of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The average exchange rate of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar increased from 63.68 during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to 67.10 during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar increased from 0.65 during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to 0.72 during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The average exchange rate of the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar increased from 45.13 during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to 47.13 during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  We recorded a net foreign exchange gain of   $3.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Interest and Other Income, net   

  Increase in interest and dividend income was primarily due to higher cash balances in our foreign subsidiaries and higher yield on our investments during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Other income further increased by $0.7 million due to interest on deposits received from income tax authorities in India on completion of a tax assessment and by $  4.1 million   due to reversal of earn-out liability related to our RPM acquisition. 
  Income Tax Expense.   The effective tax rate decreased from   34.4%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   28.6%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was the result of a (i) higher income tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to certain adjustments (resulting in an increase in income tax expense of   $2.4   million) and (ii) increase in earnings in locations with lower tax rates as well as tax incentives. The decrease in effective  
  
   35 

Table of Contents  

tax rate was partially offset by the reversal of earn-out liability of $4.1 million in other income during nine months ended September 30, 2016, related to our RPM acquisition. 
  Net Income.   Net income increased from   $36.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $46.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to higher income from operations of   $0.6 million   and an increase in other income and foreign exchange gain of   $8.1 million  . Net income further increased due to lower income tax expense of   $0.8 million  . As a percentage of revenues, net income increased from   8.0%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   9.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $214.0 million   and   $219.0 million  , respectively in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (including $156.4 million and $136.0 million, respectively, held by our foreign subsidiaries). We do not intend to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries since our future growth partially depends upon continued infrastructure and technology investments, geographical expansions and acquisitions outside of the U.S. Therefore, we anticipate that we will indefinitely reinvest the earnings generated outside of the U.S. If we were to repatriate our overseas funds, we would accrue and pay applicable taxes. 
  Operating Activities:   Cash flows from operating activities increased by $1.6 million from   $54.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $56.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Generally, factors that affect our earnings including pricing, volume of services, costs and productivity affect our cash flows provided from operations in a similar manner. However, while management of working capital, including timing of collections and payments affects operating results only indirectly, the impact on the working capital and cash flows provided by operating activities can be significant. 
  The increase in cash flows from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was due to an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses of   $10.6 million  , primarily due to an increase in net income by   $9.4 million  . This increase in cash flows from operations was partially offset by an increase  in working capital of   $25.1 million   during the    nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to an increase of   $16.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivables, advance income tax (net of income tax provision) and a decrease in accrued employee costs, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. 
  Investing Activities:   Cash flows used for investing activities decreased by   $19.7 million   from   $145.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $126.2 million   for the    nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was primarily due to cash paid for the RPM acquisition (net of cash acquired) of $44.3 million during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   compared to cash paid for Liss and IQR acquisitions (net of cash acquired) of $9.4 million during the nine months ended September 31, 2016.  The decrease was partially offset by an increase in short-term investments of   $16.0 million   (net of redemption) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Financing Activities:   Cash flows used for financing activities was   $34.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to cash flow provided by financing activities of   $9.5 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in cash flow from financing activities is primarily due to net borrowings of $20 million under the Credit Agreement (as described below in  Financing Arrangements ) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   compared to repayment of   $25.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Cash flows from financing activities further decreased due to higher purchases of treasury stock of   $2.2 million   during the   nine   months ended

Table of Contents  

September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was partially offset by higher proceeds of $3.1 million from the exercise of stock options during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  We expect to use cash from operating activities to maintain and expand our business. As we have focused on expanding our cash flow from operating activities we continue to make capital investments, primarily related to new facilities and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements to build our facilities and the purchase of telecommunications equipment and computer hardware and software in connection with managing client operations. We incurred   $20.3 million   of capital expenditures in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We expect to incur capital expenditures of between $5 million to $8 million in the remainder of 2016, primarily to meet our growth requirements, including additions to our facilities as well as investments in technology applications and infrastructure. 
  In connection with any tax assessment orders that have been issued or may be issued against us or our subsidiaries, we may be required to deposit additional amounts with respect to such assessment orders (refer to Note 16 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for further details). We anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities to finance our smaller acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital needs. If we have significant growth through acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional financing. 
  Financing Arrangements (Debt Facility) 
  On October 24, 2014 we entered into a Credit Agreement that, as amended, provides for a $100 million revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit sub-facility (as amended, the  Credit Facility ). As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding indebtedness of $45.0 million. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement mature on October 24, 2019 and may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries and for acquisitions. 
  Depending on the type of borrowing, loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the specified prime rate (alternate base rate) or adjusted LIBO rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is tied to the Company s leverage ratio and ranges from 0.25% to 0.75% per annum with respect to loans pegged to the specified prime rate, and 1.25% to 1.75% per annum on loans pegged to the adjusted LIBO rate. The revolving credit commitments under the Credit Facility are subject to a commitment fee. The commitment fee is also tied to the Company s leverage ratio, and ranges from 0.20% to 0.30% per annum on the average daily amount by which the aggregate revolving commitments exceed the sum of outstanding revolving loans and letter of credit obligations. The Credit Facility carried an effective interest rate of 1.95% and 1.56% per annum, respectively during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations. 
  Contractual Obligations

Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(a) 
    Represents estimated payments under the Gratuity Plan. 
              (b) 
    Interest on borrowings is calculated based on the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (c) 
    Excludes $2.8 million related to uncertain tax positions, since the extent of the amount and timing of payment is currently not reliably estimable or determinable. 
     Certain units of our Indian subsidiaries were established as 100% Export-Oriented units under the  STPI  scheme promulgated by the Government of India. These units are exempt from customs, central excise duties, and levies on imported and indigenous capital goods, stores, and spares. We have undertaken to pay custom duties, service taxes, levies, and liquidated damages payable, if any, in respect of imported and indigenous capital goods, stores, and spares consumed duty free, in the event that certain terms and conditions are not fulfilled. We believe, however, that these units have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required conditions. 
  Our operations centers in the Philippines are registered with the  PEZA.  The registration provides us with certain fiscal incentives on the import of capital goods and requires that ExlService Philippines, Inc. meet certain performance and investment criteria. We believe that these centers have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required criteria.

ITEM   3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes in our market risk exposure other than as disclosed herein. For more detailed discussion of our market risk associated with exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, see Item 7A  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Foreign Currency Risk.   During June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which British citizens approved an exit from the European Union ("EU"), commonly referred to as  Brexit.  As a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including as a result of a decline in the value of the U.K. pound sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. Although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our financial results, operations and cash flows. 
  Our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues, expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency accounts receivables and payable. We serve clients in the U.K. with this region generating approximately  16.6% and 17.6% of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also incurred expenses in the U.K. pound sterling in certain foreign subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which will have a positive impact due to the depreciation of GBP against the USD. A significant portion of our revenues from customer contracts denominated in the U.K. pound sterling includes protection against foreign exchange rate fluctuations which minimizes the impact of the volatility in the exchange rates on our operating results. 

ITEM   4.      Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act, ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  In making its assessment of the changes in internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2015, our management excluded an evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures of Liss and IQR which we acquired on July 1, 2016 and September 1, 2016, respectively. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained herein for details of our acquisitions. 

PART II.     Other Information 

ITEM   1.      Legal Proceedings 
  In the course of our normal business activities, various lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us. We believe that the disposition of matters currently instituted or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Please see Note 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained herein for details regarding our tax proceedings.

  EXLSERVICE HOLDINGS, INC. 
  2015 AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT 
  OF THE 
  2006 OMNIBUS AWARD PLAN 
  [FORM OF] RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (U.S.) 
  THIS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (the    Agreement   ), is made, effective as of the [  INSERT GRANT DATE  ] (hereinafter the    Date of Grant   ) by and between ExlService Holdings, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the    Company   ), and ___________________ (the    Participant   ). 
  WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the ExlService Holdings, Inc. 2015 Amendment and Restatement of the 2006 Omnibus Award Plan (the    Plan   ), pursuant to which awards of Restricted Stock Units may be granted; and 
  WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the    Committee   ) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to grant to the Participant an award of Restricted Stock Units as provided herein and subject to the terms set forth herein. 
  NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, for themselves, their successors and assigns, hereby agree as follows: 
  1.  Grant of Restricted Stock Units  .  The Company hereby grants on the Date of Grant, to the Participant a total of [ ] Restricted Stock Units (the    Award   ) on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and as otherwise provided in the Plan.  Such Restricted Stock Units shall be credited to a separate account maintained for the Participant on the books of the Company (the    Account   ).  On any given date, the value of each Restricted Stock Unit comprising the Award shall equal the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock.  The Award shall vest in accordance with Section 3 hereof and settle in accordance with Section 4 hereof. 
  2.  Incorporation by Reference, Etc  .  The provisions of the Plan are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

(i) Change in Control  .  (A)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a  Change in Control  (which for purposes of this Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan as modified by the language at the end of this Section 3) occurs at a time when any portion of the Awards remain unvested, then effective upon the consummation of the Change in Control, the vesting of the portion of the Awards which is not then fully vested shall accelerate such that any portion of the Awards which would have become vested during the one-year period following the Change in Control shall become vested effective as of the consummation of the Change in Control.   
  (B)  In addition:  (1) in the event that Participant s employment by the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Plan) (x) at any time following a Change in Control or (y) in specific contemplation of a Change in Control or (2) in the event Participant resigns with  Good Reason  (as defined below) at any time following a Change in Control, Participant shall, upon and subject to the execution within sixty (60) days following termination of employment (and non- revocation during any applicable revocation period) of a standard release of all employment-related claims against the Company and its Affiliates and each of their employees, officers and directors, be entitled to immediate vesting as of the termination date of any portion of the Awards which is unvested as of the termination date.   
  (C)  The term  Good Reason  shall have the meaning set forth in any employment, consulting or other agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant in effect on the date hereof, or, in the absence of such definition therein, the occurrence, without Participant s prior written consent, of any of the following events: 
  (1)  a substantial reduction of Participant s duties or responsibilities, or Participant being required to report to any person other than the Board or the Company s Chief Executive Officer or President; provided that, if there is a Change in Control and Participant retains a similar title and similar duties with the Company or any entity that acquires the Company (or any affiliate or subsidiary of such entity) following such Change in Control, any change in Participant s title shall not a constitute a significant reduction of Participant s duties and authorities hereunder; 
  (2)  Participant s job title is adversely changed, provided that if there is a Change in Control and Participant retains a similar title and similar duties with the Company or any entity that acquires the Company (or any affiliate or subsidiary of such entity) following such Change in Control, any change in Participant s title shall not constitute a significant reduction of Participant s duties and authorities hereunder; 

(3)  following a Change in Control, a change in the office or location where Participant is based of more than thirty (30) miles, which new location is more than thirty (30) miles from Participant s primary residence; or 
  (4)  following a Change in Control, a breach by the Company of any material term of any employment, consulting, or similar agreement between the Company and Participant; 
  provided that, a termination by Participant with Good Reason shall be effective only if, within thirty (30) days following Participant s first becoming aware of the circumstances giving rise to Good Reason, Participant delivers a  notice of termination  for Good Reason to the Company, and the Company within fifteen (15) days following its receipt of such notification has failed to cure the circumstances giving rise to Good Reason. 
  (b)  Special 409A Rule.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, a Change in Control hereunder shall not give rise to any acceleration of the vesting of any portion of an Award hereunder unless such event satisfies the definition of a change in the ownership or effective control of a corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation pursuant to Section 409A of the Code and any Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. 
  4.  Terms  . 
  (a)  Settlement  .  As soon as practicable following each applicable Vesting Date (including as applicable the date of consummation of a Change in Control and certain terminations of employment upon or following a Change in Control, as applicable), the Company shall settle the portion of the Award that is vested on such date and shall therefore (i) issue and deliver to the Participant one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit subject to the Award that has vested (the    RSU Shares   ), with any fractional shares paid out in cash (and, upon such settlement, the Restricted Stock Units shall cease to be credited to the Account) and (ii) enter the Participant s name as a stockholder of record with respect to the RSU Shares on the books of the Company.    
  (b)  Dividend Equivalents  .  If on any date that Restricted Stock Units remain credited to the Account, dividends are paid by the Company on outstanding shares of its Common Stock (   Shares   ) (each, a    Dividend Payment Date   ), then the Participant's Account shall, as of each such Dividend Payment Date, be credited with an amount (each such amount, a    Dividend Equivalent Amount   ) equal to the product of (i) the number of Restricted Stock Units in the Account as of the Dividend Payment Date and (ii) the per Share cash amount of such dividend (or, in the case of a dividend payable in Shares or other property, the per Share equivalent cash value of such dividend as determined in good faith by the Committee).  On each applicable Vesting Date, in connection with the settlement and delivery of RSU Shares as contemplated by Section 4(a), the Participant shall be entitled to receive a payment, without interest, of an amount in cash equal to the accumulated Dividend Equivalent Amounts in respect of the RSU Shares so delivered. 
  (c)  Taxes and Withholding  .
