Note 1   Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation 

Business Description 

Green Endeavors, Inc., ( Green ) owns and operates two hair salons carrying the Aveda  product line through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Landis Salons, Inc. ( Landis ) and Landis Salons II, Inc. ( Landis II ) in Salt Lake City, Utah. Green also owns and operates Landis Experience Center LLC ( LEC ), an Aveda  retail store in Salt Lake City, Utah. 

Organization 

Green Endeavors, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 25, 2002 as Jasper Holdings.com, Inc. During the year ended December 2004, Green changed its name to Net2Auction, Inc. In July of 2007, Green changed its name to Green Endeavors, Ltd. On August 23, 2010, Green changed its name to Green Endeavors, Inc. and moved the corporate domicile from Delaware to Utah. Green has four classes of stock as follows: common with 2,000,000,000 shares authorized; preferred with 3,000,000 shares authorized; convertible preferred with 2,000,000 shares authorized; and, convertible super voting preferred with 10,000,000 shares authorized. Green is quoted on the  OTC Pink  marketplace segment under the symbol GRNE. 

Green is a more than 50% controlled subsidiary of Sack Lunch Productions, Inc. ( SAKL ). Sack Lunch Productions, Inc. is listed at OTC Markets trading under the symbol SAKL and is not currently a reporting company. Previous to April 15, 2015, SAKL was known as Nexia Holdings, Inc. and was trading under its symbol NXHD. 

Landis Salons, Inc., a Utah corporation, was organized on May 4, 2005 for the purpose of operating an Aveda  Lifestyle Salon. Landis Salons, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Green. 

Landis Salons II, Inc., a Utah corporation was organized on March 17, 2010 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Green for the purpose of opening a second Aveda  Lifestyle Salon. 

Landis Experience Center, LLC ( LEC ), a Utah limited liability company, was organized on January 23, 2012 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Green for the purpose of operating an Aveda  retail store in the City Creek Mall in Salt Lake City, Utah. 

Basis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Green and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. All consolidated subsidiaries are wholly-owned by Green. 

These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In particular, the Company s significant accounting policies were presented as Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in that Annual Report. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and consist of only normal recurring adjustments. The results of operations presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the 12 months ending December 31, 2016. 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the amounts of revenue and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Green had no cash equivalents. 

Inventory 

Inventory consists of items held for resale and is carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first in, first out ( FIFO ) method. 

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at historical cost. Depreciation is generally provided over the estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, as follows: 

Leasehold improvements  
 Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life 

Computer equipment and related software  
 3 years 

Furniture and fixtures  
 3-10 years 

Equipment  
 3-10 years 

Vehicle  
 7 years 

Signage  
 10 years 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Green recorded depreciation expense of $82,773 and $102,787, respectively. 

Long-Lived Assets 

We periodically review the carrying amount of our long-lived assets for impairment. An asset is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. In the event the carrying amount of such asset is not considered recoverable, the asset is adjusted to its fair value. Fair value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flow. There were no impairments of long-lived assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories: 

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

 Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or inputs that are corroborated by market data. 

 Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 

Revenue Recognition 

There are two primary types of revenue for the Company: 1) providing hair salon services, and 2) selling hair salon products. Revenue is recognized at the time the service is performed or the product is delivered. All revenue sources are domestic. In some cases, such as the sale of gift cards, revenue is deferred until the gift card is redeemed. 

Deferred Revenue 

Deferred revenue arises when customers pay for products and/or services in advance of receiving the product or service. Green s deferred revenue consists solely of unearned revenue associated with the purchase of gift certificates for which revenue is recognized only when the service is performed or the product is delivered. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, deferred revenue was $49,911 and $66,048, respectively. 

5

Advertising 

The Company expenses advertising production costs as they are incurred and advertising communication costs the first time the advertising takes place. For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, advertising costs amounted to $69,639 and $92,029, respectively. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

Green recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments as stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the restricted stock award, option, or purchase right and is recognized as expense, less expected forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which typically equals the vesting period. Because the employee is expected to and has historically received shares of common stock on or about the date of the employee stock option grant date as part of the exercise process, the fair value of each stock issuance is determined using the fair value of Green s common stock on the grant date. 

Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Also, Green's practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Green is 100% consolidated into its parent company, SAKL, and therefore does not file an income tax return. Its financial amounts are consolidated into the SAKL income tax returns. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, a 100% valuation allowance has been placed against the deferred tax asset and therefore is not reflected on the balance sheets. 

Net Loss Per Share 

Net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the specified period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares during the specified period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 there were 1,013,448,004 potential common shares not included in the diluted net loss per share calculation as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to reduce net loss per share. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Management believes the impact of recently issued standards and updates, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on Green s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption. 

Note 3   Inventory 

Green s inventory consists of items held for resale and product that is used in services by the Landis and Landis II salons, and all are considered finished goods. Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventory amounted to $152,434 and $138,928, respectively.

Note 5   Fair Value Measurements 

Our financial assets and (liabilities) carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, consisted of the following: 

(1) 
 Derivative liability amounts are due to the embedded derivatives of certain convertible notes payable issued by the Company and are calculated using the Black Scholes pricing model (see Note 6 - Derivative liability) 

7

Note 6   Derivative       Liability    

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a $159,006 derivative liability balance on the balance sheet, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a $605 net gain from derivative liability activity. The derivative liability activity comes from convertible notes payable as follows: 

Eastshore Enterprises, Inc.  

On September 30, 2016, Green marked-to-market the fair value of the derivative liability related to the Eastshore Note and determined an aggregate fair value of $159,006 and recorded a $71,915 loss from change in fair value of derivative for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The fair value of the embedded derivative for the note was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of 0%, (2) expected volatility of 989%, (3) risk-free interest rate of 0.59%, (4) expected life of 1 year, and (5) estimated fair value of Green s common stock of $0.37 per share. 

Note 7  Related Party Transactions 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, amounts due to related parties were $628,875 and $424,804, respectively. 

Richard Surber, a related party, is providing his personal guaranty for several lines of credit and credit cards that are being utilized by the Company and its operating subsidiaries. In addition to the above, Mr. Surber is a personal guarantor to notes payable by the Company with remaining principal balances of $252,698. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, Mr. Surber continues to provide his personal guaranty for several lines of credit, credit cards, and loans that are being utilized by the Company and its subsidiaries. The total amount of these credit obligations could exceed the amount of $300,000 from time to time    .   

On September 30, 2016 the Company issued 230,621 shares of Series B and 3,843,686 shares of common stock for cancellation of a related party convertible debenture and accrued interest in the amount of $2,190,896. 

Note 8  Debt 

During the nine month period ending September 30, 2016, the Company has entered into three new loan agreements in the total amount of $526,495    .

Note 9   Stockholders  Deficit 

Preferred Stock  

Green is authorized to issue 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock (par value $.001 per share). Green s preferred stock may be divided into such series as may be established by the Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2016, Green has designated 12,000,000 of the preferred stock into two series as follows: 2,000,000 shares of Convertible Series B Preferred and 10,000,000 shares of Convertible Super voting Preferred. 

The Preferred Stock is classified as equity as long as there are sufficient shares available to effect the conversion. In some instances certain contracts may pass the option to receive cash or common stock to the shareholder. In this case, it is assumed that a cash settlement will occur and balance sheet classification of the affected Preferred Stock and related preferred paid-in capital as a liability. 

8

Convertible Super voting Preferred Stock 

Each share of the Convertible Super voting Preferred Stock is convertible into 100 shares of Green s Common stock and has the voting rights equal to 100 shares of common stock. 

During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, there were no issuances or conversions of Convertible super voting preferred shares. 

As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Green had 10,000,000 shares of Convertible super voting preferred stock issued and outstanding. 

Convertible Series B Preferred Stock 

Each share of Green s Convertible Series B Preferred Stock (Series B) has one vote per share and is convertible into $5.00 worth of common stock. The number of common shares received is based on the average closing bid market price of Green's common stock for the five days before conversion notice date by the shareholder. Series B shareholders, at the option of Green, can receive cash or common stock upon conversion. 

On September 30, 2016 the Company issued 230,621 shares of Series B for cancellation of a related party convertible debenture and accrued interest in the amount of $1,095,445. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Green had 958,228 and 734,607 shares of Series B issued and outstanding respectively. 

Common Stock  

Pursuant to an amendment to our articles of incorporation filed on June 27, 2016 the number of authorized common shares was reduced from 10,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000 (par value $0.0001 per share) and the common stock was reversed 2000:1. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and after giving effect to the reverse split, Green had 4,733,237 and 618,174 shares of common stock issued and outstanding respectively. 

On September 30, 2016 the Company issued 3,843,686 shares of common stock for cancellation of a related party convertible debenture and accrued interest in the amount of $1,095,451. 

Note 10   Stock-Based Compensation 

No stock compensation was awarded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Note 11   Litigation 

There are no new matters of litigation during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Note 12   Concentration of Risk 

Supplier Concentrations 

The Company purchases most of its salon inventory that is used for service and product sales from Aveda . Aveda  product purchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 accounted for approximately 99% of salon products purchased. 

Market or Geographic Area Concentrations 

100% of the Company's sales are in the salon services and products market and are concentrated in the Salt Lake City, Utah geographic area. 

Note 13   Going Concern 

Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America contemplate the continuation of Green as a going concern. As of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Green had negative working capital of $1,054,385 and a net loss of $274,085, which raises substantial doubt about Green s ability to continue as a going concern. Green s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to successfully fulfill its business plan. Management plans to attempt to raise additional funds to finance the operating and capital requirements of Green through a combination of equity and debt financings. While Green is making its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be sufficient for operations. 

Note 14   Subsequent Events 

In accordance with ASC 855-10 Company management reviewed all material events through the date of this report and there are no additional material subsequent events to report.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or this Quarterly Report, and in conjunction with our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Certain of these statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the extent and timing of future revenues and expenses, customer demand and other statements using words such as  anticipates,   believes,   could,   estimates,   expects,   forecast,   intends,   may,   plans,   projects,   should,   will  and  would,  and words of similar import and the negatives thereof, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are predictions based upon management s best judgment at the time they are made about future events that are not historical facts. Actual results could vary materially as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those expressed in these statements. We refer you to the  Risk Factors,   Results of Operations,  and  Liquidity and Capital Resources  sections contained in this Quarterly Report, which identify important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 

We urge you to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report are made only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update these forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

Green Endeavors, Inc. ( Green ) is a Utah corporation originally formed on April 25, 2002. Our fiscal year ends on December 31. We have never filed bankruptcy nor been through any similar financial reorganization. 

As of September 30, 2016, we operate two high-quality hair care salons that feature Aveda  products for retail sale. Landis Salons, Inc. ( Landis I ) operates its business within a 4,000 square foot space located in the Liberty Heights District of Salt Lake City, Utah as an Aveda  Lifestyle Salon. Landis Salons II, Inc. ( Landis II ) operates within a 3,024 square foot space located in the Marmalade District of Salt Lake City, Utah under the Landis Lifestyle Salon brand as an Aveda  Lifestyle Salon. A third location opened August 16, 2012, and operates as an Aveda  Experience Center ("LEC") in the City Creek Mall in Salt lake City, Utah. 

Aveda  Lifestyle Salons can be distinguished from Aveda  Concept Salons in that Aveda  Lifestyle Salons are required to carry all of Aveda s products and must meet a higher threshold for product sales than Aveda  Concept Salons. An Aveda  Lifestyle Salon is the highest level within the Aveda  hierarchy of salons which is classified by higher purchasing volume, location, array of products carried and size of retail space. 

Salon operations consist of three major components, an Aveda  retail store, an advanced hair salon, and a training academy, which educates and prepares future staff about the culture, services, and products provided by the salon. The design of the salons is intended to look modern and feel comfortable, appealing to both genders, and all age groups.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. 

Results of Operations 

The following discussion examines our results of operations and financial condition based on our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

10

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we owned and operated three wholly owned subsidiaries. Two of the subsidiaries, Landis Salons, Inc. and Landis Salons II, Inc., operate as full-service hair and retail salons featuring the Aveda  line of products. The third subsidiary, Landis Experience Center, LLC, is a retail Aveda  Experience Center. 

Revenue 

We generate revenue through the sale of services and products in the hair salon industry. For the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had net revenue of $832,507 and $733,642, respectively. 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The following table shows the change in service revenue by salon for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our salons experienced an increase of 23% in service revenues for the three month period ending September 30, 2016 over the comparable period of service sales for 2015. This increase is mostly resulting from an increase in staff that are now producing at sustainable levels. 

The following table shows the change in product revenue by salon for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our salons experienced a decrease of 13% in product revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 over the comparable period of product sales for 2015. This decline in product revenue is primarily due to the Company's senior staff spending more time in our training programs for new artists. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The following table shows the change in service revenue by salon for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our salons experienced an increase of 21% in service revenues for the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 over the comparable period of service sales for 2015. This increase is mostly resulting from an increase in staff that are now producing at sustainable levels. 

11

The following table shows the change in product revenue by salon for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our salons experienced a decrease of 8% in product revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 over the comparable period of product sales for 2015. This decline in product revenue is primarily due to the Company's senior staff spending more time in our training programs for new artists. 

Costs of Revenue 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The following table shows cost of revenue by type as a percentage of related revenue for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The cost of services revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased by 8% for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 over the comparable period for 2015. This decrease in service cost is primary due to the Company having more new employees that generate less payroll expenses. The 4% decrease in product costs as a percentage of product sales for the same comparable periods is primarily due to change in inventory shrinkage. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The following table shows cost of revenue by type as a percentage of related revenue for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The costs of services and products as a percentage of service and product revenue decreased slightly for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 over the comparable period for 2015 due primarily to a decrease in payroll and lower shrinkage. 

12

Operating Expenses 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The following table shows general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

General and administrative expenses increased by $44,647 during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The largest contributors to this were increases in office expenses and professional services. Salaries and wages increased due to our new stylists growing their repeat clients. Expenses related to professional services and investor relations and company promotions are not cyclical or recurring in nature and decreased due to the timing of strategic decisions. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The following table shows general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

13

General and administrative expenses decreased by $(193,973) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The largest contributors to this were reductions in salaries, company promotion and professional services. Salaries and wages decreased due to the hiring of less experienced stylists to replace the vacating experienced stylists. Expenses related to professional services and investor relations and company promotions are not cyclical or recurring in nature and decreased due to the timing of strategic decisions. 

Depreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $29,003 compared to $34,517 for the comparable three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $5,514 is primarily due to certain fixed assets being fully depreciated after reaching their estimated useful lives. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The increase is primarily attributable to a change in derivative fair value adjustments of $(102,671). 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The    decrease of $120,812 is attributable to decreases in interest expense, loss on derivative fair value adjustment and in stock subscription receivable, offset by a gain on settlement of debt in the prior year of $110,220.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash and Investments in marketable securities 

 Our primary sources of cash during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were customer payments for salon services and products. Our primary uses of cash were for payments relating to salaries, rent, inventory and other general operating expenses as well as payments on notes payable. 

Working Capital 

15

Working capital decreased by $182,631 as of September 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to the increase in notes payable. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Cash flows from operating activities include net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash income statement items, as well as changes in the balances of certain operating assets and liabilities. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

The change in cash flows used in investing activities was due primarily to making a related party loan and the receipt of payments on the loan. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

The increase is attributable to new debt issuances. 

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have insufficient current assets to meet our current obligations due to negative working capital of $1,054,385 as of September 30, 2016. Historically, we have funded our cash needs from a combination of revenues, carried payables, sales of equity, and debt transactions. Since we are not currently realizing net cash flows from our business, we may need to seek financing to continue our operations. Prospective sources of funding could include shareholder loans, equity sales or loans from other sources though no assurance can be given that such sources would be available or that any commitment of support is forthcoming to date. 

We do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

We expect to purchase property or equipment as part of our normal ongoing operations 

8% Series A Senior Subordinated Convertible Redeemable Debentures 

On April 30, 2008, we entered into a stock transfer agreement with our parent company SAKL and SAKL s wholly-owned subsidiary DHI whereby they would each sell their holdings in Landis and New by Salons LLC in exchange for an 8% Series A Senior Subordinated Convertible Debenture with a face amount of $3,000,000. Interest on the debenture commenced on December 30, 2008. The debenture holder has the option, at any time, to convert all or any amount over $10,000 of principal face amount and accrued interest into shares of Common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, at a conversion price equal to the greater of $0.0001 or 95% of the average closing bid price of the common stock three days prior to the date we receive notice. In February of 2011, DHI transferred the Debenture to SAKL in exchange for the release of debt obligations owed to SAKL by DHI and SAKL holder of the Debenture. All obligations under the debenture were settled with SAKL on September 30, 2016 through the issuance of common and preferred stock. 

16

Going Concern 

Our audit opinion for the year ended December 31, 2015 expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of recurring losses and negative working capital. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans to address our ability to continue as a going concern include raising additional funds to finance the operating and capital requirements through a combination of equity and debt financings. While we are making our best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations. 

Impact of Inflation 

We compensate some of our salon employees with percentage commissions based on sales they generate. Accordingly, this provides us certain protection against inflationary increases, as payroll expense is a variable cost of sales. In addition, we may increase pricing in our salons to offset any significant increases in wages and cost of services provided. Therefore, we do not believe inflation has had a significant impact on the results of our operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

Not required for smaller reporting companies pursuant to Item 305 of Regulation S-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and the Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. 

The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In the course of this evaluation, we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures, to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures, and to confirm that any necessary corrective action, including process improvements, was taken. This type of evaluation is performed every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. We intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures and to modifying them as circumstances warrant. 

Based on evaluation as of September 30, 2016, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Based on management's most recent evaluation of our company's internal control over financial reporting, management determined that there were no changes in our company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of internal control are met. Further, the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs. While our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Green Endeavors, Inc. have been detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

No material change in any legal matter, as reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  

On September 30, 2016, the Company authorized the issuance of 3,843,686 shares of Common Stock and 230,621 Shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Sack Lunch Productions, Inc. in exchange for the satisfaction and settlement of $2,190,895.52 in debenture principle and accrued interest owed to Sack Lunch by the Company that will be removed from the Company s liabilities. The shares will be issued with a restrictive legend to Sack Lunch. The share values were discounted to 95%, which was greater than the $.0001 floor, based upon the conversion provisions of the Debenture, dated December 28, 2011 in the original amount of $2,359,800 and as amended on December 11, 2015. 

In the above transactions, the Board of Directors relied upon Rule 506 of the Securities Act of 1933 in originally issuing the convertible debenture and in the subsequent issuances resulting from conversions of the debenture into common and preferred stock were done pursuant to Rule 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. 

Subsequent Events 

In accordance with ASC 855-10 Company management reviewed all material events through the date of this report and there are no additional material subsequent events to report.

None. 

Item 4. [Reserved]  

Item 5. Other Information
