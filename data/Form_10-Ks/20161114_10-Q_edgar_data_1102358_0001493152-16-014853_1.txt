    NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

  (UNAUDITED)  

(1) Basis
of Presentation   

The
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, and consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have
been prepared by us without audit. In the opinion of Management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly in all material respects
our financial position as of September 30, 2016 and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated above are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  

This
report should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  All
material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.    

BlastGard
International, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated on September 26, 2003 as BlastGard Technologies, Inc. ( BTI )
in the State of Florida, to design and market proprietary blast mitigation materials. The Company created, designs, develops and
markets proprietary blast mitigation materials. The Company s patent-pending BlastWrap  technology effectively mitigates
blast effects and suppresses post-blast fires. The Company sub-contracts the manufacturing of products to licensed and qualified
production facilities.  

The
Company went public through a shell merger on January 31, 2004. On March 31, 2004, the Company changed its name to BlastGard International,
Inc. On March 4, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of HighCom Securities, Inc and subsidiaries. These financial statements
include the assets liabilities and activity of the following:  

BlastGard
International, Inc.  BlastGard    International, Inc. is a Colorado corporation that has developed and designed
proprietary blast mitigation materials. The Company operates from offices in Clearwater, Florida and uses contract manufacturers
in various locations for production.  

BlastGard
Technologies Inc. is a dormant Florida corporation.  

HighCom
Securities, Inc.  HighCom Securities, Inc. (HighCom), is a global provider of security equipment and a leader in advanced ballistic
armor manufacturing. The Company has a manufacturing facility in Columbus, Ohio for production and has moved the corporate offices
to Clearwater, Florida as of May 1, 2011.  

Going
Concern    

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern was dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient
cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. The Company plans to continue to generate
necessary cash flows through operations. However, should the Company s sales not provide sufficient cash flow; the Company
can raise additional working capital through debt and/or equity financings. There is no assurance the Company will be successful
in producing sufficient sales revenues or obtaining additional funding through debt and equity financings.  

Business
Segments    

Although
the Company accounts for its operations in two separate corporations, all of its business operations are associated with Security
for Individuals and Property. BlastGard International, Inc. primarily provides for corporate administration, and only has incidental
sales of an immaterial amount. HighCom sales represent in excess of 99% of total sales. Therefore the Company has determined that
all business operations should be aggregated together and not reported as separate operating segments.  

Accounting
Policies     

Principles
of Consolidation    

These
consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of BlastGard International, Inc. and its subsidiaries as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

All
material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles required management to make estimates
and assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

The
Company considered all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash
equivalents.  

Financial
Instruments    

The
carrying amounts of cash, receivables and current liabilities approximated fair value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments.
Debt obligations were carried at cost, which approximated fair value due to the prevailing market rate for similar instruments.  

Fair
Value Measurement     

All
financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities were recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements. This
value was evaluated on a recurring basis (at least annually). Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States define
fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on a measurement
date. The accounting principles also established a fair value hierarchy which required an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Three levels of inputs were used to measure fair
value.  

Level
1: Quotes market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that were corroborated by market data.  

Level
3: Unobservable inputs that were not corroborated by market data.  

Accounts
Receivable    

Accounts
receivable consisted of amounts due from customers based in the United States and abroad. The Company considered accounts more
than 30 days old to be past due. The Company used the allowance method for recognizing bad debts. When an account was deemed uncollectible,
it was written off against the allowance. The Company generally does not require collateral for its accounts receivable. Management
deems all accounts receivable to be collectable at September 30, 2016.  

Inventory    

Inventory
was stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Market was generally considered to be net realizable value. Inventory
consisted of materials used to manufacture the Company s product and finished goods ready for sale.  

Property
and Equipment    

Property
and equipment were stated at cost. Depreciation was calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the related assets, ranging from three to seven years. Expenditures for additions and improvements were capitalized, while
repairs and maintenance costs were expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment
sold or otherwise disposed of were removed from the accounts and any gain or loss was recorded in the year of disposal.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets    

The
Company evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets at least annually. Impairment losses were recorded on long-lived
assets used in operations when indicators of impairment were present and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated
by those assets were less than the assets  carrying amount. If such assets were impaired, the impairment to be recognized
was measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed
of were reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.  

Debt
Issue Costs    

The
costs related to the issuance of debt were capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over the
lives of the related debt. The straight-line method results in amortization that was not materially different from that calculated
under the effective interest  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable
and earned when all of the following criteria are met:  

(i)  
      persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists,   

(ii)  
      the
    product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,   

(iii)  
      the
    sales price is fixed or determinable, and   

(iv)  
      collectability
    is reasonably assured.   

The
Company  s product and return policy allows for merchandise purchased directly from the Company
to be returned after obtaining a Return Authorization Number during the 30 day period following date of shipment by the Company
for a refund of the purchase price.    

Research
and Development   

Research
and development costs were expensed as incurred. Research and development costs totaled $43,386 and $7,564 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research and development costs totaled $57,699 and $35,760 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Advertising   

Advertising
costs for tradeshows and social media were expensed as incurred. Advertising costs of $48,615 and $48,960 were incurred during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Shipping
and Freight Costs   

The
Company includes shipping costs in cost of goods sold.  

Income
Taxes     

Income
taxes were provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due
plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the recorded book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities
for financial and income tax reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those
differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities were recovered or settled. Deferred tax
assets were also recognized for operating losses that were available to offset future taxable income and tax credits that were
available to offset future federal income taxes, less the effect of any allowances considered necessary. The company use guidance
provided by ASC-740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, for reporting uncertain tax provisions.  

Stock-based
Compensation    

We
use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant, using assumptions
for volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. We have used one grouping for the assumptions as our
option grants were primarily basic with similar characteristics. The expected term of options granted has been derived based upon
our history of actual exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted were expected to be outstanding.
Historical data was also used to estimate option exercises and employee terminations. Estimated volatility was based upon our
historical market price at consistent points in a period equal to the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate
was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant and the dividend yield was based on the historical dividend
yield. Compensation expense for stock based compensation is recognized over the vesting period.  

Income
(Loss) per Common Share    

Basic
net loss per share excludes the impact of common stock equivalents. Diluted net income (loss) per share utilizes the average market
price per share when applying the treasury stock method in determining common stock equivalents. As of September 30, 2016, there
were 38,000,000 vested common stock options outstanding, which were not included in the calculation of net income per share-diluted
because they were anti-dilutive. In addition, at September 30, 2016 the Company had 41,801,793 remaining warrants outstanding
issued in connection with convertible promissory notes that were also not included because they were anti-dilutive.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

We
have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof
that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new
pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles
will have a material impact on the corporation s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability
of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration. Reference
is made to these recent accounting pronouncements as if they are set forth therein in their entirety.  

(2) Inventory   

Our
inventory is made up of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods. Our inventory is maintained at  

our
manufacturing facilities.

Stock
Compensation     

The
Company periodically offered options to purchase stock in the Company to vendors and employees. There were 25,000,000 options
granted during the 3rd quarter of 2015 to three key employees and 1,500,000 options granted during the 3 rd  quarter
of 2015 to a board member for consultant services.  

The
Board s policy with respect to options is to grant options at the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options
generally become fully vested after one year from the date of grant and expire five years from the date of grant. During the years
ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 there were 0 and 0 options granted, respectively and 0 and 1,450,000 expired un-exercised, respectively.
On March 25, 2014, the Board of Directors approved granting all four directors 500,000 shares exercisable at $.02 per share. The
options are for 5 years and are fully-vested, non-statutory stock options. The options to purchase 500,000 shares of the Company s
Common Stock, effective March 25, 2014, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share were granted to the following persons: Michael
J. Gordon, Paul W. Henry, Solomon Mayer and Keith Brill. The options to purchase 750,000 shares of the Corporation s Common
Stock, effective March 10, 2015, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share were granted to the following persons: Michael J. Gordon,
Paul W. Henry, Solomon Mayer and Keith Brill.  

There
were no net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the year ended December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based payments which was expected to be recognized
in the future

following table represents stock option activity as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

The
total grant date fair value of options vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $38,742 and $84,858
respectively.  

The
following table represents stock warrant activity as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

Derivative
Liability   

We
review the terms of convertible debt issues to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded
conversion options, which are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments. In circumstances
where the host instrument contains more than one embedded derivative instrument, including the conversion option, that is required
to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument  

Bifurcated
embedded derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair
value reported as non-operating income or expense. When the equity or convertible debt instruments contain embedded derivative
instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds received are first allocated to the
fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments. The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the host instruments
themselves, usually resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value. The discount from the face
value of the convertible debt, together with the stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument
through periodic charges to interest expense, using the effective interest method.  

During
2011, the Company entered into certain convertible debt agreements with warrants attached. B ecause
the warrant values exceeded the note values after the beneficial conversion feature discount, the warrants have been bifurcated
out and recorded separately. The initial value was the fair value less the fair value of the debt discount. The difference between
the amortized fair value and the revalued fair value at each reporting period is recorded as a derivative liability. This derivative
liability will change every reporting period based on the current market conditions.   

The
Company used the following Black-Scholes assumptions in arriving at the fair value of the warrants as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015.  

The
Derivative Liability consists of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

(7) Income
Taxes   

The
Company incurred a net operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and has realized net income in various prior
periods presented. Due to the deferred tax attributes of the derivatives and a deferred tax asset from prior periods, which was
fully allowed for, no income tax benefit or expense has been presented. Any tax liability associated with any profits was offset
by the deferred tax assets and changing in the valuation allowance on those tax assets.  

(8) Concentration
of Credit Risk for Cash   

The
Company has concentrated its credit risk for cash by maintaining deposits in a financial institution, which may at times exceed
the amounts covered by insurance provided by the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). At
September 30, 2016, the Company had no funds in excess of the FDIC insurance limits.  

(9) Commitments
and Contingencies   

From
time to time the Company may be a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company. Management believes that there
are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.  

Office

approximately 38,000 square feet of office and warehouse space in Columbus, OH.  Rental payment
under the new lease is $9,627 per month on a month to month basis until June 2016 and then $8,901 through October 2018.   

HighCom

of $518 per month. On January 1, 2015, HighCom secured similar office space in Centennial, CO for one year at a rental of $525
per month, which was renewed January 2016 for one year.  

Rent
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $96,882 and $111,287.  

Prior
Litigation Matter    

Verde
Partners Family Limited Partnership  

On
April 2, 2009, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement to settle our outstanding civil litigation. The Company will pay
the sum of $125,000 over 18 months. The first monthly payment was paid within 30 days after the Defendants deliver to the Company s
counsel an original executed version of the Agreement and a promissory note in the amount of the remaining principal balance to
bear interest in the amount of 6% per annum. Upon Verde s receipt of the payment and promissory note, the parties shall
jointly dismiss with prejudice all litigation between them, including the Pinellas County action and the Federal action. The company
and Verde also entered into a license agreement whereby BlastGard obtains a fully paid up non-exclusive license for the 2 Verde
patents for the remaining life of those patents in exchange for the Company paying Verde a 2% royalty for the life of the patents
(which expired in the 2 nd  quarter of 2012), on the sales price received by BlastGard for BlastGard s portion
of all blast mitigation products sold by the company (the royalty was not on any third-party s portion of any product containing
blast mitigation products sold by BlastGard). The parties also agreed not to file any complaints with any state, federal or international
agency or disciplinary body regarding any of the other parties or any person affiliated with any of the other parties or otherwise
makes negative statements about them (in other words, a broad non-disparagement clause). The company and Verde also signed mutual
general releases (excepting the obligations above) and a covenant not to sue. At September 30, 2016, the Company was in arrears
on the final twelve monthly payments on the settlement.  

(10) Material
Agreements and Transactions   

On
November 11, 2013, the Board of Directors approved the following transactions: (i) the issuance of 2,000,000 shares to corporate
counsel; and pursuant to his position as chairman of the Company s advisory board an option to purchase 2,000,000 shares
of Common Stock which vested on January 1, 2014 and an option to purchase 2,000,000 shares which will vest on January 1, 2015,
exercisable at $.009 per share so long as Mr. Keifner is still serving as chairman of the Company s advisory board on the
vesting date. In his capacity, Mr. Kiefner will serve as a lasison between the Company and its principal shareholder, to attend
meetings of the Company s board of directors, to meet with the Company s officers on a regular basis and provide corporate
counsel; (ii) lowering the conversion price from $.05 per share to $.01 per share of certain notes described in Note 5 in the
Notes to Financial Statements; and (iii) granting options to purchase an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock to Michael
J. Gordon, Michael L. Bundy and Chad Wright with options exercisable at $.01 per share from the vesting date through the expiration
date of said options. These options have cliff vesting where they are exercisable over a period of time, but they can become immediately
vested in the event certain revenue goals are achieved. In the event the Company achieves $10 million in sales in a calendar year,
25% of the total options will automatically vest. An additional 25% will vest when the Company achieves $20 million in sales in
a calendar year and 50% of the total options granted will automatically vest when the Company achieves $30 million in sales in
a calendar year.  

(11) Gain
on settlement of debt

the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company negotiated the settlement of an account payable to a single vendor for invoices
from 2010 that were on the books of HighCom when acquired in March 2011. The vendor has conceded the full amount as settled, resulting
in a gain on settlement of debt in the amount of $300,200.  

(12) Subsequent
Events   

The
Company has evaluated all subsequent events through the filing date of this form 10Q for appropriate accounting and disclosures,
and there are no subsequent event disclosures required.

Results
of Operations   

The
following information represents our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized sales of $2,812,357 and $532,891 and a gross profit of $957,447
and $212,169, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized sales of $4,757,632 and $4,461,761
and a gross profit of $1,600,598 and $1,904,409, respectively.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our operating expenses were $616,522 as compared to $457,364 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our operating expenses were $1,437,130 as compared to $1,352,047
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increased operating expenses were due to additional temporary personnel necessary
to keep up with the demand for increased sales and the recording of stock based compensation associated with the vesting of certain
warrants during 2016.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, total other income (expense) was $(141,902). This included a loss on derivative liability
in the amount of $107,620, and interest expense of $34,282. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total other income (expense)
was $139,608. This included a gain on settlement of debt of $300,200, offset by a loss on derivative liability of $63,361 and
interest expense of $97,231.  

Our
net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $192,041 as compared to $113,811, respectively. Our net
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $ 292,655 as compared to $492,887, respectively. Other income
(expense) as shown in our statement of operations have a substantial impact on our net income for each reported period.  

Backlog
of Sales   

As
of the filing date of this Form 10-Q, the Company is working on fulfilling booked sales of approximately $2.1 million that is
expected to be shipped in the 4th quarter of 2016. The Company has hired temporary personnel to complete these orders and this
will substantially increase our operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Management is optimistic that additional sales will
occur in the fourth quarter of 2016, although no assurances can be given in this regard.

    II body armor   provides protection against many handgun threats, including many common smaller caliber pistols with
    standard pressure ammunition, and against many revolvers.   

Type
    IIIA body armor- provides a higher level of protection and will generally protect against most pistol calibers including many
    law enforcement ammunitions, and against many higher poared revolvers.   

Type
    III and IV body armor   provides protection against rifle rounds and are generally only used in tactical situations.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources.    

At
September 30, 2016, we had cash of $133,223, working capital of $1,543,506, an accumulated deficit of $(14,735,154) and shareholder
equity of $3,755,889.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used by operating activities was $316,994. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we used cash in investing activities for purchase of assets of $7,087 and we generated cash from financing activities
of $348,053.  

For
the nine months ending September 30, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $51,731. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, we used cash in investing activities for purchase of assets of $52,799 and we generated cash from financing
activities of $52,688.  

We
anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to finance our accounts receivable and inventories,
and from the need to fund our growth from operations, current debt obligations and capital expenditures. The primary sources of
funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional capital from the sale of
equity and/or debt securities. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, to remain a going concern. Our continuation
as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and
ultimately to attain profitability. The Company is attempting to obtain cash to finance its operations through the sale of equity,
debt borrowing and/or through the receipt of product licensing fees. We can provide no assurances that financing will be available
to us on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, or that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Further, we can provide
no assurances that a mutually acceptable licensing agreement will be entered into on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. In this
respect, see  Note 1   Going Concern  in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility
that we may not be able to continue as a  going concern.   

To
date, we have relied on management s ability to raise capital through equity private placement financings to fund our operations.
We estimate that we will require between $1.0 million and $1.5 million in additional financing and cash flow from operations to
support our operations and to meet our debt obligations as they become due and payable over the next 15 months of operations.
We can provide no assurances that cash generated from operations will occur or additional financing will be obtained on terms
satisfactory to us, if at all, or that additional debt conversions will occur.  

Application
of critical accounting policies   

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the Company s Consolidated Financial
Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and corresponding disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we continue to evaluate our estimates which in large
part are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The
results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

Market
risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our short term money market
investments. The Company does not have any financial instruments held for trading or other speculative purposes and does not invest
in derivative financial instruments, interest rate swaps or other investments that alter interest rate exposure. The Company does
not have any credit facilities with variable interest rates.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures  

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure based closely on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rule 13a-15(e). In designing
and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective at the reasonable assurance
level at the end of our most recent quarter. There have been no changes in the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
or in other factors that could affect the disclosure controls subsequent to the date the Company completed its evaluation. Therefore,
no corrective actions were taken.

1.  
      I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016, of BlastGard International, Inc.;   

2.  
      Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements are made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;   

3.  
      Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;   

4.  
      The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:   

(a) designed such disclosure controls
and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material
information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

b) designed such internal control
over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 

(c) evaluated the effectiveness of
the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 

(d) disclosed in this report any
change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent

is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 

5.  
      The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

(a) all significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 

(b) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial
reporting.
