Note 1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements of FLIR Systems, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the  Company ) are unaudited and have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, these statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations for the interim periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FLIR Systems, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  Reclassifications 
  The Company made certain reclassifications to the prior year's financial statements to conform them to the presentation as of   September 30, 2016  . Restructuring expenses of   $0.3 million   and   $1.1 million   have been reclassified to research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  These reclassifications had no effect on consolidated financial position, shareholders' equity or net cash flows for any of the periods presented. 

Note 2. 
    Stock-based Compensation 
       
  Stock Incentive Plans 
    
  The Company has a stock-based compensation program that provides equity incentives for employees, consultants and directors. This program includes incentive and non-statutory stock options and nonvested stock awards (referred to as restricted stock unit awards) administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.  
    
  Under the stock-based compensation program, the Company has granted time-based options, time-based restricted stock unit awards, performance-based restricted stock unit awards and market-based restricted stock unit awards. Options generally expire ten years from their grant dates. Time-based options and restricted stock unit awards generally vest over a three year period. Shares issuable under the performance-based restricted stock unit awards are earned based upon the Company's return on invested capital over a three year period.  Shares issuable under market-based restricted stock unit awards are earned based upon the Company's total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return over a three year period of the component company at the 60th percentile level in the Standard   Poor's 500 Index.  Shares vested under the performance-based restricted stock unit awards and the market-based restricted stock unit awards must be held by the participant for a period of one year from the vest date. 
    
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ) which allows employees to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at 85 percent of the lower of the fair market value at the date of enrollment or the fair market value at the purchase date. The ESPP provides for six-month offerings commencing on May 1 and November 1 of each year with purchases on April 30 and October 31 of each year. Shares purchased under the ESPP must be held by employees for a period of at least 18 months after the date of purchase.

Note 4. 
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
     Factors used in determining the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities are summarized into three broad categories in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement : 
               Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical securities as of the reporting date; 
      Level 2   other significant directly or indirectly observable inputs, including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk; and 
      Level 3   significant inputs that are generally less observable than objective sources, including our own assumptions in determining fair value. 

The factors and methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. 
  The Company had   $147.3 million   and   $29.0 million   of cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which were primarily investments in money market funds. The Company has categorized its cash equivalents as a Level 1 financial asset, measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets of identical assets. The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are disclosed in Note 5, "Derivative Financial Instruments," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements below and are based on Level 2 inputs. The fair value of the Company s senior unsecured notes as described in Note 13, "Long-Term Debt," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements is approximately   $440.1 million   and   $254.1 million   based upon Level 2 inputs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The fair value of the Company's borrowings under the revolving credit facility, also described in Note 13, approximates the carrying value due to the variable market rate used to calculate interest payments. The Company does not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value. 

Note 5. 
    Derivative Financial Instruments 
     Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Contracts 
  In general, the gains and losses related to the Company's foreign currency exchange rate contracts recorded in other expense, net are offset by the reciprocal gains and losses generated from foreign currency changes on the settlement of underlying assets or liabilities which originally gave rise to the exposure. The net losses for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   were   $3.1 million   and   $5.2 million  , respectively. The net losses for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   were   $8.9 million   and   $7.0 million  , respectively.  
    
  The following table provides volume information about the Company's foreign currency exchange rate contracts. The table below presents the net notional amounts of the Company's outstanding foreign currency forward contracts in United States dollar equivalent amounts (in thousands):

FLIR Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary, FLIR Commercial Systems, Inc. (formerly known as Indigo Systems Corporation) (together, the  FLIR Parties ), were named in a lawsuit filed by Raytheon Company ( Raytheon ) on March 2, 2007 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Raytheon's complaint, as amended, asserted claims for tortious interference, patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, unfair competition, breach of contract and fraudulent concealment. The FLIR Parties filed an answer to the complaint on September 2, 2008, in which they denied all material allegations. On October 27, 2010, the FLIR Parties and Raytheon entered into a settlement agreement that resolved the patent infringement claims (the "Patent Claims") pursuant to which the FLIR Parties paid   $3 million   to Raytheon and entitles the FLIR Parties to certain license rights in the patents that were the subject of the Patent Claims.  On October 28, 2014, a four-week trial began with respect to Raytheon's remaining claims of misappropriations of trade secrets and claims related to 31 alleged trade secrets. On November 24, 2014, a jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas rejected Raytheon s claims and determined that 27 of the alleged trade secrets were not in fact trade secrets and that neither of the FLIR Parties infringed any of the trade secrets claimed and awarded Raytheon no damages.  On March 31, 2016 the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued a Final Judgment denying Raytheon s claims and awarding FLIR court costs and denying each of Raytheon s and FLIR s Renewed Motions for Judgment as a Matter of Law and denying FLIR s Amended Rule 54(d) Motion for Attorneys  Fees and Costs Under the Texas Theft Liability Act.   
    
  On April 29, 2016, Raytheon filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of the denial by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas of Raytheon s Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, or in the Alternative, Motion for New Trial. On May 11, 2016, the FLIR Parties filed a  Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of the Order of  the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Denying the FLIR Parties  Amended Rule 54(d) Motion for Attorneys  Fees and Costs under the Texas Theft Liability Act, the Order Denying the FLIR Parties  Renewed Motion For Judgment as a Matter Of Law, and the Final Judgment to the extent it denied the FLIR Parties Attorneys  Fees and Costs under the Texas Theft Liability Act.  The matter remains ongoing and is subject to appeal and the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of potential loss or recovery, if any, which might result if the final determination of this matter is favorable or unfavorable, but an adverse ruling on the merits of the original claims against the FLIR Parties, while remote, could be material.  
    
  On October 22, 2014, the Company initially contacted the United States Department of State Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance ( DDTC ), pursuant to International Traffic in Arms Regulation ( ITAR )   127.12(c), regarding the unauthorized export of technical data and defense services to dual and third country nationals in at least four facilities of the Company.  On April 27, 2015, the Company submitted its initial report to DDTC regarding the details of the issues raised in the October 22, 2014 submission.  DDTC subsequently notified the Company that it was considering administrative proceedings under Part 128 of ITAR and requested a tolling agreement, which the Company executed on June 16, 2015. On June 6, 2016, the Company executed a subsequent tolling agreement extending the tolling period for matters to be potentially included in an administrative proceeding for an additional 18 months until December 2017.  DDTC continues its review and the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the time it may take to resolve the matter or the amount or range of potential loss, penalty or other government action, if any, that may be incurred in connection with this matter.  However, an unfavorable outcome could result in fines and penalties or loss or modification of exporting privileges that could potentially be material to the financial condition and results of operations of the Company in and following the period in which such an outcome becomes estimable or known.

    Contingencies - (Continued)  
       
  In March 2016, the Company learned of potential quality concerns with respect to as many as 312 Level III and Level IV SkyWatch Surveillance Towers sold by FLIR and companies acquired by FLIR from 2002 through 2014. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company identified the cause of these quality issues and tested certain remedial solutions which may be required to repair the affected SkyWatch Towers. Testing of the remedial solution is ongoing. The Company has notified customers who purchased the affected SkyWatch Towers of the potential concerns and, as a precautionary measure, has also temporarily suspended production of all Level III and Level IV SkyWatch Towers pending the completion of its review and the implementation of any necessary remedial measures. While there still remains uncertainty related to estimating the costs associated with a potential remedy and number of units which may require such remedy, the Company currently estimates the range of potential loss to be between $2 million and $20 million.  As no single amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the Company has recorded a liability of $2 million as of September 30, 2016.  Factors underlying this estimated range of loss may change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate 
    
  The Company is also subject to other legal and administrative proceedings, investigations, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business not specifically identified above. In these identified matters and others not specifically identified, the Company makes a provision for a liability with respect to a matter when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated for such matter. The Company believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses for matters in existence on the date hereof. While the outcome of each of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company does not expect that the ultimate resolution of any such matter will individually have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  The costs to resolve all such matters may in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

The provision (benefit) for income taxes was as follows: 

The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is lower than the US Federal tax rate of   35 percent   because of the mix of lower foreign jurisdiction tax rates, the effect of federal, foreign and state tax credits and discrete adjustments.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company recorded discrete tax expenses of $40.0 million primarily related to the European Commission s decision regarding certain tax legislation in Belgium impacting one of the Company s international subsidiaries. The Belgian Government announced that they have appealed this decision and filed an action for annulment with the General Court of the European Union.  In July 2016, the Company filed a separate appeal with the General Court of the European Union. The outcome of an appeal, new information received from the Belgian Government, or other future events may cause the income tax provision associated with the decision to be entirely or partially reversed.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $53.4 million   of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized. The Company anticipates an immaterial portion of its net unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized within 12 months as the result of settlements or effective settlements with various tax authorities, the closure of certain audits and the lapse of the applicable statute of limitations.  
  The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $2.2 million   of net accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

    Business Acquisitions 
       
  On November 30, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of DVTEL Inc. ("DVTEL"), a provider of software and hardware technologies for advanced video surveillance, for approximately   $97.5 million   in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary net tangible and identifiable intangible assets has been recorded as goodwill within the Company's Security segment and is subject to the final determination on the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  
  The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for DVTEL is as follows (in thousands): 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made revisions to certain estimates in the preliminary purchase price allocation, including changes to deferred taxes and tangible assets and liabilities. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price related to this acquisition is based on management s judgments after evaluating several factors, including preliminary valuation assessments of tangible and intangible assets, and preliminary estimates of the fair value of liabilities assumed. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets, property and equipment, income taxes (including uncertain tax positions) and certain other tangible assets and liabilities. The final allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be completed when the final valuation assessments of tangible and intangible assets are completed and estimates of the fair value of liabilities assumed are finalized during the year ended December 31, 2016. The preliminary goodwill of   $60.5 million   represents future economic benefits expected to arise from synergies from combining operations and the ability of DVTEL to provide the Company domain knowledge and distribution channels in adjacent security markets. 
  On June 28, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Armasight, Inc. ("Armasight"), a developer of sporting and military optics products, for approximately   $43.5 million   in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.  At June 30, 2016, the Company initially reported the   $36.0 million   excess of the purchase price over the preliminary net tangible assets acquired had been recorded in Other assets. The Company has since performed a preliminary purchase price allocation which resulted in an allocation of   $7.6 million   to identifiable intangible assets and   $31.1 million   to goodwill which has been recorded in the Company s Surveillance segment.  
  The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for Armasight is as follows (in thousands):

Results of Operations 
  The following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by addressing key elements in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The  Segment Operating Results  section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated revenue and earnings from operations.  Our six operating segments are:  Surveillance, Instruments, Security, OEM   Emerging Markets, Maritime and Detection.  Given the nature of our business, we believe revenue and earnings from operations (including operating margin percentage) are most relevant to an understanding of our performance at a segment level as revenue levels are the most significant indicators of business conditions for each of the respective segments and earnings from operations reflect our ability to manage each of our segments as revenue levels change. Additionally, at the segment level we disclose backlog, which represents orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months.  See Note 17, "Operating Segments and Related Information," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the six operating segments.  
  Revenue.   Consolidated revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   6.1 percent   year over year, from   $381.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $405.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  .  Consolidated revenue for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   6.1 percent   year over year, from   $1,119.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015   to   $1,187.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  .  Increases in revenues for the three month period in our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM   Emerging Markets, Maritime, and Detection segments were partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Security segment. Increases in revenues for the   nine   month period in our Surveillance, Security, OEM   Emerging Markets, Maritime and Detection segments were partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Instruments segment. 
  The timing of orders, scheduling of backlog and fluctuations in demand in various regions of the world can give rise to quarter to quarter and year over year fluctuations in the mix of revenue. Consequently, year over year comparisons for any given quarter may not be indicative of comparisons using longer time periods. While we currently expect total annual revenue for   2016   to be higher than   2015   revenue, unexpected changes in economic conditions from key customer markets or other major unanticipated events may cause total revenue, and the mix of revenue between our segments, to vary from quarter to quarter during the year. 
  International sales accounted for   43.4 percent   of total revenue for both the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and 45.4 percent and 47.5 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The proportion of our international revenue compared to total revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to normal variation in order activity across various regions as well as specific factors that may affect one region and not another.  Overall, we anticipate that revenue from international sales will continue to comprise a significant percentage of total revenue. 
  Cost of goods sold.   Cost of goods sold for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $213.9 million   and   $635.0 million  , respectively, compared to cost of goods sold for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   of   $201.2 million   and   $573.2 million  , respectively. The year over year increase in cost of goods sold primarily relates to higher revenues and changes in segment and product mix. 
  
   18 

Gross profit.   Gross profit for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was   $191.4 million   compared to   $180.7 million   for the same quarter last year.  Gross profit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $552.4 million   compared to   $546.3 million   for the same period last year.  Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, decreased from   47.3 percent   in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   47.2 percent   in the   third   quarter of   2016   and decreased from   48.8 percent   in the first   nine   months of 2015 to   46.5 percent   in the first   nine   months of 2016. The decrease in gross margin for the   nine   month period was primarily due to changes in product mix and manufacturing cost variances and under-absorption. 
  Research and development expenses.   Research and development expenses for the   third   quarter of   2016   totaled   $32.7 million  , compared to   $31.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Research and development expenses for the first   nine   months of   2016   totaled   $106.0 million  , compared to   $101.1 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were   8.1 percent   and   8.9 percent   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.   Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were   8.2 percent   and   9.0 percent   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  We have, and will continue to have, fluctuations in quarterly spending depending on product development needs and overall business spending priorities and believe that annual spending levels are more indicative of our commitment to research and development.  Over the past five annual periods through   December 31, 2015  , our annual research and development expenses have varied between 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $77.9 million   and   $73.6 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $242.9 million   and   $232.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses year over year for the three month period was primarily related to incremental expenses associated with DVTEL, acquired in November 2015, and Armasight, acquired in June 2016, partially offset by cost control measures executed during the current quarter.  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses year over year for the   nine   month period was primarily related to the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expenses of DVTEL and Armasight and higher corporate legal expenses, partially offset by lower corporate administration expenses and other cost control efforts realized in 2016.  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were   19.2 percent   and   19.3 percent   for the quarters ended   September 30,     2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   20.5 percent   and   20.8 percent   for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  Over the past five annual periods through   December 31, 2015  , our annual selling, general and administrative expenses have varied between 20.1 percent and 23.6 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future. 
  Interest expense.   Interest expense for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $13.5 million  , compared to   $10.7 million   for the same period of   2015  . Interest expense for the year was primarily associated with the $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes that were repaid in July 2016, the $425 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior unsecured notes that were issued in June 2016, and amounts drawn under our credit facility. Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $5.7 million  , compared to   $3.7 million   for the same period in 2015. The year over year increase in interest expense is primarily due to the increased amount of interest bearing debt as well as a $1.3 million loss on the extinguishment of the $250 million unsecured notes that were repaid in July 2016. 
  Income taxes.   The income tax provision of   $16.6 million   and   $85.6 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, represents an effective tax rate of   24   percent, excluding discrete items. The first quarter of 2016 included discrete tax charges totaling $40.0 million, primarily related to the European Commission's decision regarding certain tax legislation in Belgium impacting one of our international subsidiaries. The Belgian Government announced that they have appealed this decision and filed an action for annulment with the General Court of the European Union. In July 2016, the Company filed a separate appeal with the General Court of the European Union. The outcome of the appeal, new information received from the Belgian Government, or other future events may cause the income tax provision associated with the decision to be entirely or partially reversed. Excluding discrete items, we expect the annual effective tax rate for the full year of   2016   to be approximately   24   percent.  The expected effective tax rate is lower than the US Federal tax rate of 35 percent because of the mix of lower foreign jurisdiction tax rates, and the effect of federal, foreign and state tax credits.

Segment Operating Results 
  Surveillance 
  Surveillance operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): 

Revenue for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   3.7   percent and   6.2 percent  , respectively, compared to the same periods of   2015  . The increase in revenue for the three and nine month periods was primarily due to the acquisition of Armasight in June 2016 and increases in our weapon sights and other portable/hand-held product lines and our integrated systems product line, partially offset by a decline in revenue in our airborne product line.  Revenues from US government customers in the three and nine month periods increased by approximately 33 percent and 45 percent, respectively, over the prior year.  
  Instruments 
  Instruments operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): 

Revenue for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   10.5 percent   and   decreased   by   3.5 percent  , respectively, compared to the same periods of   2015  . The increase in revenue for the three month period was primarily due to increases in our building and predictive maintenance and firefighting products lines. The decrease in revenue for the nine month period was primarily due to a decline in sales in Europe; on a product line basis, the segment revenue decline was primarily in our building and predictive maintenance product line. The decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of 2015, was primarily due to decreased revenues and lower gross margins as a result of manufacturing cost variances and under-absorption, and investments in low cost optics capabilities.  
  Security 
  Security operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): 

Revenue for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   by   4.9 percent   and   increased   by   5.5 percent  , respectively, compared to the same periods of   2015  .  The decrease in revenue for the three month period is primarily due to a decrease in consumer-grade security products compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue for the nine month period was primarily due to the acquisition of DVTEL in November 2015 and the inclusion of the associated revenues in the current year. The decrease in earnings from operations year over year for the three and nine month periods was primarily due to acquisition-related amortization and higher operating expenses associated with the DVTEL acquisition.  
  
   20 

OEM   Emerging Markets 
  OEM   Emerging Markets operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): 

Revenue   increased   by   21.9   percent and   21.8 percent   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods of   2015  . The increase in revenue year over year for the three and nine month periods was primarily due to higher deliveries in most of the segment product lines, particularly in cores and components and mobile accessories. Geographically, all regions reported year over year increases. Segment earnings from operations increased for the three and nine month periods primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by lower gross margins.  
  Maritime 
  Maritime operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): 

Revenue for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   4.3   percent and   3.9 percent  , respectively, compared to the same periods of   2015  . The increase in revenue year over year for the three and nine month periods was primarily due to an increase in the Americas and Europe regions. On a product basis, increased shipments of multifunction displays and infrared cameras more than offset declines in autopilot and instrument shipments.  
    
  Detection 
  Detection operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): 

Revenue for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   2.3   percent and   13.5 percent  , respectively, compared to the same periods of   2015  . The increase in revenue for the three and nine month period was primarily related to increased shipments from our CBRNE threat response systems to United States government customers. The increase in earnings from operations and operating margins for the three and nine month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods during the prior year were primarily due to the increases in revenue and reduced operating expenses.  
  
   21 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a total of   $677.7 million   in cash and cash equivalents, of which   $211.0 million   was in the United States and   $466.7 million   was at our foreign subsidiaries, compared to cash and cash equivalents at   December 31, 2015   of   $472.8 million  , of which   $129.6 million   was in the United States and   $343.2 million   was at our foreign subsidiaries. The increase in cash and cash equivalents during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the proceeds from long-term debt and cash from operating activities, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt,   $42.4 million   spent on the acquisitions of Armasight and ISD, capital expenditures of   $27.7 million  , repurchase of common stock of   $66.1 million   and dividend payments of   $49.6 million  . 
  Cash provided by operating activities totaled   $215.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which primarily consisted of net earnings and reductions in working capital, adjusted for non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and other non-cash items. 
  Cash used by investing activities totaled   $63.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , consisting of   $42.4 million  , net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Armasight and ISD     and     capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business. 
  Cash provided by financing activities totaled   $50.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which primarily consisted of the net proceeds from long-term debt and the new credit agreement, partially offset by $251.2 million to repay long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, and payment of dividends.   
  On February 8, 2011, we signed a Credit Agreement ( Credit Agreement ) with Bank of America, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and other lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a $200 million, five-year revolving line of credit. On April 5, 2013, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the maturity of the revolving credit facility from February 8, 2016 to April 5, 2018 in addition to incorporating a $150 million term loan facility maturing April 5, 2019.  On May 31, 2016, the Credit Agreement was further amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $500 million and to extend the maturity of the revolving credit facility from April 5, 2018 to May 31, 2021.  We have the right, subject to certain conditions, including approval of additional commitments by qualified lenders, to increase the line of credit by an additional $200 million until May 31, 2021. The Credit Agreement allows us and certain designated subsidiaries to borrow in US dollars, euros, Swedish kronor, pound sterling and other agreed upon currencies. The Credit Agreement requires us to pay a commitment fee on the amount of unused credit at a rate, based on the Company s leverage ratio, which ranges from 0.15 percent to 0.30 percent. The Credit Agreement contains two financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios with which we were in compliance at   September 30, 2016  . The five-year revolving line of credit available under the Credit Agreement and the term loan facility are not secured by any of our assets. 
  As noted above, the Credit Agreement amendment of April 5, 2013 incorporated a   $150 million   term loan facility that was scheduled to mature on April 5, 2019.  On May 31, 2016, we drew down $105 million under the revolving credit facility and repaid the term loan facility in full. Interest is accrued at the one-month LIBOR rate plus the scheduled spread and paid monthly.   By entering into interest rate swap agreements, we have effectively fixed the basis for calculating the interest rate on the term loan.  The effective interest rate paid is equal to the fixed rate in the swap agreements plus the credit spread then in effect. At   September 30, 2016  , the effective interest rate on the term loan was   2.37 percent  . Principal payments of $3.75 million, at our option, will continue to be made in quarterly installments through December 31, 2018 with the final maturity payment including any accrued interest due on April 5, 2019.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had $97.5 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the commitment fee on the amount of unused credit was   0.175 percent  . We had   $21.6 million   of letters of credit outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , which reduced the total available credit under the revolving credit facility. 
  On August 19, 2011, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes due September 1, 2016 (the "2011 Notes"). The interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1. The proceeds from the Notes were used for general corporate purposes, which include working capital and capital expenditure needs, business acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock.  The 2011 Notes were repaid on July 5, 2016. 
  In June 2016, we issued $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 (the  2016 Notes ).  The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2016 Notes were approximately $421.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which are being amortized over a period of five years. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on December 15 and June 15. The proceeds from the 2016 Notes were used to repay the 2011 Notes in July 2016 and are being used for general corporate purposes, which include working capital and capital expenditure needs, business acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock. 
  On   February 5, 2015  , our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   15.0 million   shares of our outstanding common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   6.3 million   shares had been repurchased under this authorization, which expires on   February 5, 2017  .

United States income taxes have not been provided for on accumulated earnings of certain subsidiaries outside of the United States as we intend to reinvest the earnings in operations outside the United States indefinitely.  Should we subsequently elect to repatriate such foreign earnings, we would need to accrue and pay United States income taxes, thereby reducing the amount of our cash. 
  On October 3, 2016, the Company announced that its subsidiary, FLIR Integrated Imaging Solutions, Inc., reached a definitive asset purchase agreement to acquire the assets of Point Grey Research Inc. ( Point Grey ). The Company completed this acquisition on November 4, 2016 for approximately $259 million in cash, which is subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment. The acquisition is intended to augment FLIR s existing OEM cores and components business by adding a broad range of visible spectrum machine vision cameras and solutions. Additionally, the Company s thermal sensor technology is expected to further extend Point Grey s product range into new application spaces. 
  We believe that our existing cash combined with the cash we expect to generate from operating activities and our available credit facilities and financing available from other sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. We do not have any significant capital commitments for the next twelve months nor are we aware of any significant events or conditions that are likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  Through   September 30, 2016  , we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2014-09"), which establishes new guidance under which companies will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also provides for additional disclosure requirements. While ASU 2014-09 was to be effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, on July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date to periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017.  Accordingly, the Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, and is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern" ("ASU 2014-15"). Under the new guidance, management will be required to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Accordingly, the Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2014-15 on January 1, 2017, and does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have any impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory" ("ASU 2015-11"). The amendments in this update require inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted. The Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2015-11 on January 1, 2017, and does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("ASU 2016-01"). The pronouncement revises the classification and measurement of investments in certain equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for certain financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 requires the change in fair value of many equity investments to be recognized in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018, and does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-01 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The amendments in this update require the identification of arrangements that should be accounted for as leases by lessees. In general, for lease arrangements exceeding a twelve month term, these arrangements must now be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee. ASU 2016-02 requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment  
  
   23 

to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, and is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU 2016-02. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The amendments in this update identify areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company currently intends to adopt ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017, and is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU 2016-09.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). The amendments in this update provide clarification regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payment are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 in the third quarter of 2016, and our early adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
