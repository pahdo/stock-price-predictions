NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation  : The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with United States ( U.S. ) generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regulations. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (which may be referred to as  West ,  the Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015   Annual Report ). The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. 
    
  Segment Reporting:   Beginning in 2016, we changed our organization and reporting structure for our next phase of growth and development, which resulted in a change to Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products as our reportable segments. Segment results presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of this change. Please refer to Note 15,   Segment Information  , for additional details. 

Note 2:  New Accounting Standards 
    
  Recently Adopted Standards 
    
  In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance that simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments in business combinations, by eliminating the requirement to account for those adjustments retrospectively. Instead, the acquirer will be required to recognize measurement-period adjustments in the reporting period in which the amounts are determined. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016, on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016, on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016, on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  In January 2015, the FASB issued guidance which removes the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP. This guidance eliminates the requirement for companies to spend time assessing whether items meet the criteria of being both unusual and infrequent. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the accounting for share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. In this case, the performance target would be required to be treated as a performance condition, and should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The guidance also addresses when to recognize the related compensation cost. We adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance to reduce the diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the transition to the equity method of accounting. This guidance eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when there is an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for leases. This guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to expand disclosures about leasing arrangements, both qualitative and quantitative. In terms of transition, the guidance requires adoption based upon a modified retrospective approach. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Management is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance regarding the subsequent measurement of inventory. This guidance requires inventory measured using any method other than last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value represents estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance which defines management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.

     Table of Contents  

In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. The FASB subsequently issued additional clarifying standards to address issues arising from implementation of the new revenue recognition standard. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of one year prior to the current effective date. Entities can choose to apply the guidance using either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. Management is continuing to evaluate the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements.  

Note 3:  Net Income Per Share 
    
  The following table reconciles the shares used in the calculation of basic net income per share to those used for diluted net income per share: 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   0.1 million   and   0.8 million   shares, respectively, not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because their impact was antidilutive. There were   0.1 million   and   0.6 million   antidilutive shares outstanding during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  In December 2015, we announced a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to   700,000   shares of the Company s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately-negotiated transactions as permitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 10b-18. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such transactions will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions. The program commenced on January 1, 2016 and is expected to be completed by December 31, 2016. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company purchased   117,310   shares of its common stock under this program at a cost of   $9.6 million  , or an average price of   $81.46   per share. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company purchased   370,810   shares of its common stock under this program at a cost of   $26.8 million  , or an average price of   $72.14   per share.

Note 5:  Affiliated Companies 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we made an   $8.4 million   cost-method investment in an intradermal drug delivery company. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate carrying amount of investments in equity-method affiliates was   $68.0 million   and   $56.3 million  , respectively, and the aggregate carrying amount of cost-method investments was   $13.4 million   and   $5.0 million  , respectively. Please refer to Note 5,   Affiliated Companies  , to the consolidated financial statements in our   2015   Annual Report for additional details. 

Note 6:  Debt 
    
  The following table summarizes our long-term debt obligations, net of current maturities and unamortized debt issuance costs. The interest rates shown in parentheses are as of December 31, 2015.  

Please refer to Note 8,   Debt  , to the consolidated financial statements in our   2015   Annual Report for additional details regarding our debt agreements. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $28.5 million   in outstanding borrowings under our   $300.0 million   multi-currency revolving credit facility, of which   $4.9 million   was denominated in Japanese Yen ( Yen ) and   $23.6 million   was denominated in Euro. The total amount outstanding under this facility at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was classified as long-term. These borrowings, together with outstanding letters of credit of   $3.0 million  , resulted in a borrowing capacity available under this facility of   $268.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Please refer to Note 7,   Derivative Financial Instruments  , for a discussion of the foreign currency hedges associated with this facility.

     Table of Contents  

In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , we had   $35.4 million   outstanding under our   five  -year term loan due January 2018, of which   $2.5 million   was classified as current. Please refer to Note 7,   Derivative Financial Instruments  , for a discussion of the interest-rate swap agreement associated with this loan. 

Note 7:  Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  Our ongoing business operations expose us to various risks such as fluctuating interest rates, foreign exchange rates and increasing commodity prices. To manage these market risks, we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, options and foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the related underlying exposures. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
     
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a   $35.4 million   forward-start interest rate swap outstanding that hedges the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable interest rate of our variable-rate   five  -year term loan. Under this swap, we receive variable interest rate payments based on   one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR )   plus a margin in return for making monthly fixed interest payments at   5.41%  . We designated this swap as a cash flow hedge. 
    
  Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
    
  In 2015, we entered into a    20.0 million   forward exchange contract, designated as a fair value hedge, to neutralize our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates on a cross-currency intercompany loan. Changes in the fair value of this derivative are recognized within other expense and are offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying exposure being hedged.  
    
  In addition, in 2015 and 2016, we entered into the following foreign currency hedge contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 
    
  In 2015, we entered into a series of foreign currency contracts intended to hedge the currency risk associated with a portion of our forecasted U.S. dollar ( USD )-denominated inventory purchases made by certain European subsidiaries. The remaining notional amount is    5.5 million   (  $6.1 million  ).   
    
  We also entered into a series of foreign currency contracts in 2015 to hedge the currency risk associated with a portion of our forecasted Euro-denominated sales of finished goods by one of our USD functional-currency subsidiaries. The remaining notional amount is    4.5 million   (  $4.9 million  ). 
    
  In 2016, we entered into a series of foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency risk associated with a portion of our forecasted Yen-denominated inventory purchases made by West in the U.S. The remaining notional amount is    355.1 million   (  $3.0 million  ).  
    
  We also entered into a series of foreign currency contracts in 2016 to hedge the currency risk associated with a portion of our forecasted Yen-denominated inventory purchases made by certain European subsidiaries. The remaining notional amount is    180.0 million   (  $1.6 million  ).

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016  , a portion of our debt consisted of borrowings denominated in currencies other than USD. We have designated our    21.0 million   (  $23.6 million  ) Euro-denominated borrowings under our multi-currency revolving credit facility as a hedge of our net investment in certain European subsidiaries. A cumulative foreign currency translation gain of   $0.3 million   pre-tax (  $0.2 million   after tax) on this debt was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as of   September 30, 2016  . We have also designated our    500.0 million   (  $4.9 million  ) Yen-denominated borrowings under our multi-currency revolving credit facility as a hedge of our net investment in Daikyo Seiko, Ltd. ( Daikyo ). At   September 30, 2016  , there was a cumulative foreign currency translation loss on this Yen-denominated debt of   $0.8 million   pre-tax (  $0.5 million   after tax), which was also included within accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  Many of our proprietary products are made from synthetic elastomers, which are derived from the petroleum refining process. We purchase the majority of our elastomers via long-term supply contracts, some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices. The following economic hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment since they did not meet the highly effective requirement at inception. 
    
  In February 2016, we purchased a series of call options for a total of   71,900   barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oil-based surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases through December 2016. With these contracts we may benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no downward exposure other than the   $0.2 million   premium that we paid to purchase the contracts. 
    
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the gain recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these call options was   $0.1 million  .

  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy classifies the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into one of three levels: 

Level 1  : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2  : Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
                
    Level 3  : Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions. 
       
  The following tables present the assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis:

     Table of Contents  

Deferred compensation assets are included within other noncurrent assets and are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices in an active market. The fair value of our foreign currency contracts, included within other current assets and other current liabilities, is valued using an income approach based on quoted forward foreign exchange rates and spot rates at the reporting date. The fair value of our contingent consideration, included within other current and other long-term liabilities, is discussed further in the section related to Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair value of deferred compensation liabilities is based on quoted prices of the underlying employees  investment selections and is included within other long-term liabilities. Our interest rate swap, included within other long-term liabilities, is valued based on the terms of the contract and observable market inputs (i.e., LIBOR, Eurodollar synthetic forwards and swap spreads). Please refer to Note 7,   Derivative Financial Instruments  , for further discussion of our derivatives. 
    
  Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to our SmartDose  electronic patch injector system ( SmartDose contingent consideration ) was initially determined using a probability-weighted income approach, and is revalued at each reporting date or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Changes in the fair value of this obligation are recorded as income or expense within other expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration are the sales projections, the probability of success factors, and the discount rate. Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. As development and commercialization of SmartDose progresses, we may need to update the sales projections, the probability of success factors, and the discount rate used. This could result in a material increase or decrease to the contingent consideration liability. 
    
  The following table provides a summary of changes in our Level 3 fair value measurements: 

Other Financial Instruments 
    
  We believe that the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable approximate their fair values due to their near-term maturities.  
    
  The estimated fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of long-term debt was   $240.4 million   compared to a carrying amount of   $228.6 million  . At   December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of long-term debt was   $225.0 million   and the carrying amount was   $228.9 million  .

Note 9:  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  On May 3, 2016, at our 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved the adoption of the West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2016 Plan ). All remaining shares available for issuance under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2011 Plan ) were extinguished upon adoption of the 2016 Plan. Awards granted under previous plans remain outstanding until expiration or settlement. The 2016 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and performance awards to employees and non-employee directors. A committee of the Board of Directors determines the terms and conditions of awards to be granted. Vesting requirements vary by award. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   5,422,685   shares remaining in the 2016 Plan for future grants. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we granted   607,228   stock options at a weighted average exercise price of   $63.75   per share based on the grant-date fair value of our stock to key employees under the 2011 and 2016 Plans. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was   $12.35   per share as determined by the Black-Scholes option valuation model using the following weighted average assumptions: a risk-free interest rate of   1.43%  ; expected life of   5.9   years based on prior experience; stock volatility of   21.6%   based on historical data; and a dividend yield of   1.0%  . Stock option expense is recognized over the vesting period, net of forfeitures. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we granted   114,029   performance vesting share ( PVS ) awards at a weighted average grant-date fair value of   $60.37   per share to key employees under the 2011 and 2016 Plans. Each PVS award entitles the holder to   one   share of our common stock if the annual growth rate of revenue and return on invested capital targets are achieved over a   three  -year performance period. Shares earned under PVS awards may vary from   0%   to   200%   of an employee s targeted award. The fair value of PVS awards is based on the market price of our stock at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the performance period, adjusted for estimated target outcomes and net of forfeitures. 
    
  Total stock-based compensation expense was   $4.6 million   and   $14.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , stock-based compensation expense was   $3.6 million   and   $24.4 million  , respectively. Included in the 2015 year-to-date amount was a   $10.4 million   charge related to executive retirements, which was recorded within other expense. Refer to Note 12,   Other Expense  , for further discussion of this charge. The remainder of 2015 stock-based compensation expense was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.

During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a   $49.0 million   pension settlement charge, within other expense, in connection with our purchase of a group annuity contract from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife ) to settle   $139.4 million   of our   $313.6 million   outstanding pension benefit obligation under our U.S. qualified pension plan. MetLife assumed the obligation to pay future pension benefits and provide administrative services beginning November 1, 2015 for approximately   1,750   retirees and surviving beneficiaries who retired prior to January 1, 2015 and were receiving payments from this plan. The purchase was funded directly by plan assets. 
    
  In addition, we made contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in the amount of   $1.3 million   in September 2015 and   $13.7 million   in October 2015, in order to maintain the plan's funded status as of the transaction date.

Restructuring and Related Charges 
    
  On February 15, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan designed to repurpose several of our production facilities in support of growing high-value proprietary products and to realign operational and commercial activities to meet the needs of our new market-focused commercial organization.   
    
  We expect to incur total restructuring and related charges of   $25.0 million   to   $28.0 million   under this plan, which consists of approximately   $8.0 million   in severance charges for personnel reductions and   $17.0 million   to   $20.0 million   in non-cash asset write-downs. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $2.3 million   in restructuring and related charges, consisting of   $1.4 million   for severance charges and   $0.9 million   for a non-cash asset write-down associated with the discontinued use of certain equipment. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $23.7 million   in restructuring and related charges, consisting of   $7.8 million   for severance charges,   $10.0 million   for a non-cash asset write-down associated with the discontinued use of a trademark, and   $5.9 million   for non-cash asset write-downs associated with the discontinued use of a patent and certain equipment. The balance of the charges related to this plan will be recognized as incurred during the remainder of 2016 and in 2017.

Other Items 
    
  During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a   $49.0 million   pension settlement charge in connection with our purchase of a group annuity contract from MetLife. Please refer to Note 10,   Benefit Plans  , for additional details regarding this purchase. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded a   $10.9 million   charge for executive retirement and related costs, including   $2.4 million   for a long-term incentive plan award for our previous Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ),   $8.0 million   for the revaluation of modified outstanding awards to provide for continued vesting for our previous CEO and Senior Vice President of Human Resources in conjunction with their retirement, and   $0.5 million   for other costs, including relocation and legal fees. 
    
  On February 17, 2016, the Venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the Bolivar, from the previously-prevailing official exchange rate of   6.3   Bolivars to USD to   10.0   Bolivars to USD, and streamlined the previous three-tiered currency exchange mechanism into a dual currency exchange mechanism. As a result, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded a   $2.7 million   charge. After the remeasurement, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $3.9 million   in net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars, including   $2.9 million   in cash and cash equivalents, and   $1.4 million   in non-monetary assets. If there are further devaluations of the Bolivar or other changes in the currency exchange mechanisms in Venezuela in the future, a pre-tax charge of up to   $6.0 million   could be required. We will continue to actively monitor the political and economic developments in Venezuela.

The unearned income is being recognized as development income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the agreement. The agreement does not include a future minimum purchase commitment from the customer.  
    
  Contingent consideration costs represent changes in the fair value of the SmartDose contingent consideration. Please refer to Note 8,   Fair Value Measurements  , for additional details.

Note 13:  Income Taxes 
    
  The tax provision for interim periods is determined using the estimated annual effective consolidated tax rate, based on the current estimate of full-year earnings before taxes, adjusted for the impact of discrete quarterly items. The provision for income taxes was   $14.4 million   and   $38.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and the effective tax rate was   29.3%   and   28.1%  , respectively.

Note 14:  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  From time to time, we are involved in product liability matters and other legal proceedings and claims generally incidental to our normal business activities. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. While the outcome of current proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, we believe their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  There have been no significant changes to the commitments and contingencies included in our   2015   Annual Report.

Note 15:  Segment Information 
    
  In 2015, our business operations consisted of   two   reportable segments, the Pharmaceutical Packaging Systems segment ( Packaging Systems ) and the Pharmaceutical Delivery Systems segment ( Delivery Systems ). Beginning in 2016, we changed our organization and reporting structure for our next phase of growth and development, which resulted in a change to Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products as our reportable segments. The Proprietary Products reportable segment, which is a combination of the previous Packaging Systems segment and the proprietary products portion of the previous Delivery Systems segment, develops commercial, operational, and innovation strategies across our global network, with specific emphasis on product offerings to biologic, generic, and pharmaceutical customers. The Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment, which consists of the contract manufacturing portion of the previous Delivery Systems segment, serves as a fully integrated business focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex assemblies for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers.  
    
  Segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs, which include executive and director compensation, stock-based compensation, adjustments to annual incentive plan expense for over- or under-attainment of targets, certain pension and other retirement benefit costs, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. Also excluded are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations. Such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments and other specifically-identified income or expense items.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  OVERVIEW 
    
  The following discussion is intended to further the reader s understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of our Company. It should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our 2015 Annual Report. These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2015 Annual Report and in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Form 10-Q ). 
    
  Throughout this section, references to  Notes  refer to the footnotes to our condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, unless otherwise indicated. 
    
  Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  For the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year-over-year results, we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The constant-currency amounts are calculated by translating the current year s functional currency results at the prior-year period s exchange rate. We may also refer to consolidated operating profit and consolidated operating profit margin excluding the effects of unallocated items. The re-measured results excluding effects from currency translation and excluding the effects of unallocated items are not in conformity with U.S. GAAP and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations, and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results. 
    
  Our Operations 
    
  In 2015, our business operations consisted of two reportable segments, Packaging Systems and Delivery Systems. Beginning in 2016, we changed our organization and reporting structure for our next phase of growth and development, which resulted in a change to Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products as our reportable segments. The Proprietary Products reportable segment, which is a combination of the previous Packaging Systems segment and the proprietary products portion of the previous Delivery Systems segment, develops commercial, operational, and innovation strategies across our global network, with specific emphasis on product offerings to biologic, generic, and pharmaceutical customers. The Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment, which consists of the contract manufacturing portion of the previous Delivery Systems segment, serves as a fully integrated business focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex assemblies for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers. We also maintain global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in Japan and Mexico. 
    
  The information and discussion included in this Form 10-Q reflects the structure in place since January 1, 2016. 
    
  2016 Financial Performance Summary 
    
  Consolidated net sales increased by $32.2 million, or 9.4%, and $86.7 million, or 8.3%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015, due to growth in our high-value product offerings.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The following table presents cash flow data for the   nine months ended     September 30  : 

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities     Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, due to improved operating results and a decrease in pension plan contributions, partially offset by higher working capital requirements and an increase in income tax payments. 
    
  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities     Net cash used in investing activities increased by $43.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, due to an increase in capital spending, to $122.7 million, and our $8.4 million cost-method investment in an intradermal drug delivery company.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures: 

Cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity. Net debt and total invested capital are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that should not be used as a substitute for the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents     Our cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2016 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in high-quality, short-term investments.  The cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2016 included $70.5 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the U.S., and $135.4 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the U.S. Deferred income taxes have not been provided for any funds held by subsidiaries outside of the U.S., as such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the U.S. 
    
  Working capital     Working capital at September 30, 2016 increased by $61.9 million, or 17.2%, as compared to December 31, 2015, including an increase of $2.0 million due to foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $69.0 million, accounts receivable and inventories increased by $26.0 million and $17.1 million, respectively, and total current liabilities decreased by $81.1 million. Accounts receivable and inventories increased due to increased sales activity and timing, as accounts receivable and inventories are typically lower at year-end due to plant shutdowns. The decrease in current liabilities was primarily due to the maturity of our Euro note B between those period ends. 
    
  Debt and credit facilities     The $67.0 million decrease in total debt at September 30, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, resulted from net debt repayments of $69.2 million, which included the maturity of our Euro note B, partially offset by foreign currency rate fluctuations of $2.1 million and a reduction of $0.1 million in unamortized debt issuance costs. 
    
  Our sources of liquidity include our $300.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2016, we had $28.5 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility, of which $4.9 million was denominated in Yen and $23.6 million was denominated in Euro. The total amount outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was classified as long-term. These borrowings, together with outstanding letters of credit of $3.0 million, resulted in a borrowing capacity available under this facility of $268.5 million at September 30, 2016. We do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds. 
    
  Pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 

34 

     Table of Contents  

We believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations. 
    
  Commitments and Contractual Obligations 
    
  A table summarizing the amounts and estimated timing of future cash payments resulting from commitments and contractual obligations was provided in our   2015   Annual Report. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our commitments and contractual obligations. 
    
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs, as noted in our   2015   Annual Report.

    dependence on third-party suppliers and partners, some of which are single-source suppliers of critical materials and products, including our Japanese partner and affiliate, Daikyo; 
                
    the loss of key personnel or highly-skilled employees; 
                
    the availability and cost of skilled employees required to meet increased production, managerial, research and other needs, including professional employees and persons employed under collective bargaining agreements; 
                
    interruptions or weaknesses in our supply chain, which could cause delivery delays or restrict the availability of raw materials, key purchased components and finished products; 
                
    the successful and timely implementation of price increases necessary to offset rising production costs, including raw material prices, particularly petroleum-based raw materials; 
                
    the cost and progress of development, regulatory approval and marketing of new products; 
                
    our ability to obtain and maintain licenses in any jurisdiction in which we do business;

  SIGN-ON BONUS REPAYMENT AGREEMENT 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the Offer Letter dated August 24, 2016  (the  Offer Letter ), provided to me, David Montecalvo, by West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (the  Company ), the Company will pay me $150,000 gross (the  Sign-On Bonus ) on the first normal payroll date following my employment commencement with the Company ( Start Date ). 
    
  For purposes of this Agreement: 

Cause  means (A) any willful failure by you to perform your duties or responsibilities or to comply with any valid and legal directives of your direct supervisor; (B) any act of fraud, embezzlement, theft or misappropriation of the funds of the Company by you, or your admission to or conviction of a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude, fraud, embezzlement, theft or misrepresentation; (C) your engagement in dishonesty, illegal conduct or misconduct that is materially injurious to the Company; (D) your breach of any material obligation under any written agreement between you and the Company; or (E) a material violation of a rule, policy, regulation or guideline imposed by the Company or a regulatory or self-regulatory body having jurisdiction over the Company. With respect to subsections (A), (D) and (E), the Company shall give you written notice of any alleged breach or violation of these subsections and afford you 30 days in which to remedy the condition. 

Good Reason  means the occurrence of any of the following without your consent: (1) a material diminution in your base salary; (2) a material reduction in your duties, authority or responsibilities relative to your duties, authority, and responsibilities in effect immediately prior to such reduction; or (3) the relocation of your principal place of employment in a manner that lengthens by fifty (50) or more miles your one-way commuting distance to your place of employment; provided that a termination shall only be for Good Reason if: (a) within forty-five (45) calendar days of the initial existence of Good Reason, you provide written notice of Good Reason to the Company; (b) the Company does not remedy said Good Reason within thirty (30) calendar days of its receipt of such notice; and (c) you terminate employment within sixty (60) calendar days after the expiration of such 30-day remedy period.   
       
  In consideration of the payment of the Sign-On Bonus, I agree to the following: 

In the event that, within 24 months of my Start Date, I terminate my employment with the Company for any reason other than death, disability or Good Reason, or the Company terminates my employment for Cause, I agree to fully repay the Company the amount of the Sign-On Bonus paid by the Company.   
                
    I am required to repay the Company for Sign-On Bonus immediately upon the applicable termination of employment.   
                
    I grant an express lien and authorize the Company to deduct from any and all amounts otherwise payable by the Company to me at the time of termination including, wages, accrued, untaken vacation pay, and any severance payments, an amount equal to the Sign-On Bonus.  The deduction of any amounts by the Company does not relieve me of the obligation to pay the Company the amount in excess of the amount deducted. 
                
    In the event of my termination, I am responsible for any tax consequences resulting from the payment of the Sign-On Bonus or the repayment of the Sign-On Bonus by me to the Company.  I will not be eligible for tax gross-up assistance.  I accept responsibility for any tax liabilities, credits and/or deductions that I may incur as a result. 
                
    I agree that in the event that I do not timely repay the amounts owed to the Company upon termination, interest will accrue on a monthly compounding basis at the prime rate of interest plus 1%.   
                
    In the event that it shall become necessary for the Company to pursue its claims against me for the repayment of the Sign-On Bonus, any costs or expenses incurred by the Company including attorney s fees, shall be my responsibility and any judgment entered against me with regard to the same should include the recovery of such costs and expenses. 

I have read this agreement and agree to its terms and conditions.  This agreement does not create a contract of employment for any specific period or vest any rights in me other than those specifically provided above.  Execution of this agreement is a condition to receiving any installment of the Sign-On Bonus.

  Dear David: 
    Congratulations.  On September 26, 2016, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted you the following stock options.    

The expected value is calculated using the Black-Scholes option value on the date of the award.  The awards were made under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the  Plan ).  We have attached a summary of the terms of your awards.  Please read it carefully. 
  I am pleased that you are a participant in this long-term incentive compensation program and trust that your participation will be beneficial to both you and the Company. 
    
  Sincerely, 
    
  Amanda Furiato 
  Senior Manager, Global Compensation 
    
  Enclosures 

Summary of Your Stock Options 
  What is a stock option? 
  A stock option is the right to purchase a fixed number of shares at a set exercise price.  The option granted by this award is a non-qualified stock option.  The stock option gains value when the price of our common stock exceeds the exercise price.  
  How many shares may I purchase and what is the price? 
  The number of shares you may purchase and the exercise price are as follows: 

May I purchase the shares immediately? 
    
  No.  So long as your employment with us continues (except as described below in the event of retirement, death or disability), your option becomes exercisable - or  vests  - as per the schedule below.  At the end of the period, you may exercise the entire option.  The following chart shows when and what portion of your option is exercisable each year. 

However, in no event will your option be exercisable after the Expiration Date set forth below. 
  Will my options vest if I retire? 
  Your options will continue to vest, even if you terminate employment due to retirement, if you have a    Qualifying Retirement    on or after October 1, 2016.   To be a Qualifying Retirement, the following criteria must be met at the time of your termination of employment: 
            2. 
    You have rendered 10 years of service to the Company and its affiliates; and 
              3. 
    Your termination must not be due to  Cause  as defined in the Plan and not due to death or disability. 
     Vesting will cease and all outstanding awards will be immediately forfeited if the Committee determines in its sole and absolute discretion that any of the following circumstances have occurred: 
           1. 
    To the extent permitted by applicable law, you compete with the Company during the period of continued vesting as described in Exhibit II;   
              2. 
    You fail to comply with any confidentiality agreements with the Company before or after your termination of employment;,  
              3. 
    The Company determines that it could have terminated you for  Cause  due to facts or circumstances discovered after your termination of employment. 
     During the entire period of continued vesting upon Qualifying Retirement, you remain subject to the Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy described in Exhibit I.  If you violate the terms of that policy, vesting will also immediately cease. 
    
  What happens if I die or become disabled before the award is fully vested? 
    
  Your options will vest immediately 100% if you die or become disabled during the vesting period. 
    
  What happens if I terminate employment for any reason other than a Qualifying Retirement, Death or Disability? 
    
  Your options will immediately cease vesting upon your termination of employment. 
    
  When will my option expire? 

If you remain employed, the option expires on February 23, 2026, which will be referred to as the  Expiration Date.   This means that once it becomes exercisable, the option may be exercised   until February 22  ,     2026  .  In addition, 
             
    if you die, the option will remain exercisable for one year from your date of death; 
                
    if you terminate employment due to disability or a Qualifying Retirement, the option will remain exercisable until the Expiration Date; 
                
    if your employment terminates for any reason other than a Qualifying Retirement, disability, death or removal for cause, the option will expire 90 days after the termination date; 
                
    if we terminate your employment for cause, the option will expire on the commencement of business on your date of termination. 
     How do I exercise my stock option? 
    
  There are four ways to exercise a stock option. 

Cash.    You write a check to the Company for the exercise price, plus any applicable withholding taxes. 
                
    Already owned shares  .  You may deliver or attest vested shares of common stock that you own with a fair market value equal to the exercise price, plus any applicable withholding taxes. 
                
    Combination of shares and cash  .  You may use a combination of cash and stock. 
                
    Reduction of proceeds  .  You may elect to have shares you would otherwise receive upon the exercise reduced by an amount equal to the total exercise cost divided by the fair market value of the shares at the time of your exercise.  In effect, you would receive the  net  shares otherwise due to you after deducting for the exercise cost, plus applicable withholding taxes. 
       
  When do I have to pay for the exercise? 
    
  The full exercise price and applicable taxes must be paid within three days of exercise. 
  Will I receive dividends on my unexercised options? 
    
  No.  Dividends are only payable to you after you exercise your option as long as you do so before the applicable dividend record date. 
  Additional Information Applicable to Your Stock Option Award 
    
  Are there other circumstances that would lead to a forfeiture of my award or the proceeds that I receive from exercising my award? 
  Yes.  All awards are subject to our Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy, which is attached to this award letter as Exhibit I.  You are encouraged to carefully read that policy and contact me or the Law Department if you have any questions.  The policy generally provides that in addition to forfeitures of all or part of your award due to your termination of employment discussed above, in certain other situations you will forfeit your award and may be required to reimburse us for the amounts you receive as a result of any option that you exercise or share of stock that you sell.   Your acceptance of this award is expressly conditioned on your agreement to be subject to the Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy, including the provisions that allow us to deduct any proceeds from other sources of income payable to you.  This award would not be made if you did not agree to be subject to that policy.  
  The clawback period described in the Incentive Compensation Recovery policy is extended for the full duration of the period of continued vesting described in this award.  The Compensation Committee may determine in its sole and absolute discretion that if circumstances exist that would permit the recovery of incentive compensation paid to you during the vesting period, in addition to recovering this compensation, all vesting will immediately cease and the remainder of your awards will be forfeited immediately. 
    
  Does the Securities Trading Policy apply to my award?   
    
  Yes.  All sales of shares of company stock (including shares received upon exercise of an option) and all option exercise transactions are subject to our Securities Trading Policy.  Option exercises by West s officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 or on the designated persons list under our policy also must meet the review and  

written pre-approval by our General Counsel requirements of that policy.  For information and to access the required pre-clearance form, please go to   IntraWest   and look     under the     Legal   Compliance tab. 
    
  Does my acceptance of this award guarantee me any future awards, continued employment or additional severance pay? 
    
  No.  This award is granted at the sole discretion of West.  Your receipt of this award does not guarantee any future awards, nor does it guarantee your continued employment with the Company.  Subject to applicable law, your employment may be terminated for any reason.  Additionally, this award is not part of your base pay or compensation for determination of any severance pay or benefits you may be entitled to upon termination of employment unless that is specifically agreed to in writing between you and the Company. 
    
  Where can I find additional information about my award? 
    
  This is a summary of the terms of your stock option award.  Your award is subject to the terms of the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. This award is being delivered with an Information Statement, which gives additional information about your award and the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan under which it was granted.  We encourage you to read the Information Statement.  Additional terms and conditions may apply to your award under the terms of the Omnibus Plan.   

EXHIBIT I 
  Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy 
    
  The Company may seek to recover incentive compensation awarded to any recipient in accordance with the terms of this policy.  Each award of annual or long-term equity-based or performance-based compensation must specify that the award is subject to this policy. 
    
  Restatement of Financial Results  .  The Company will cancel or will seek to recover all or a portion of an award from any executive officer of the Company if the Company is required to significantly or materially restate its financial statements (other than to comply with changes to applicable accounting principles) with respect to any of the three fiscal years before the payment of the award.  The Company also will not pay or will seek to recover all or a portion of an award from any award recipient whose fraud or misconduct causes the restatement of the Company s financial statements with respect to any of the three fiscal years before the payment of the award. 
    
  Calculation Errors  .  Even if no financial results are restated, if an award is paid or distributed, and it is subsequently determined that the award should have been less than the amount calculated due to mathematical errors, fraud, misconduct or gross negligence, the Company may seek repayment of the award from any award recipient during the three-year period following the payment of the award. 
    
  Detrimental Conduct  .  If an award recipient directly or indirectly engages in conduct that competes with the Company, or any conduct that is materially inimical, contrary, harmful to, or not in the best interests of the Company or if the award recipient fails to comply with any of the material     terms and conditions of the award (unless the failure is remedied within ten days after having been notified of such failure), then the Company has the discretion to immediately cancel any and all outstanding awards and require that the award recipient repay all or any portion of an award, including the gain realized on the exercise of a stock option, stock appreciation right or the disposition of any other equity-based award.  To be subject to this policy, the detrimental conduct must have occurred while the award recipient was rendering service to the Company, or during the six-month period following the later of (1) the date the recipient ceases rendering service to the Company or, (2) the date the award is paid (or an option or stock appreciation right is exercised). 
    
  Exercise of Discretion  .  With respect to executive officers and members of the board of directors, the compensation committee has the sole and absolute authority (unless the board determines that the whole board should have such authority) to determine whether to exercise its discretion to seek repayment or cancel an award and what portion of an award should be recovered or canceled.  With respect to all other award recipients, the officers of the Company have sole and absolute authority.  The compensation committee, board or officers, as appropriate, will consider all relevant facts and circumstances in exercising their discretion.  These facts and circumstances include: (1) the materiality of any changes to calculations or financial results, (2) the potential windfall received by recipients, (3) the culpability and involvement of the award recipients, (4) the controls in place to limit misconduct or incorrect reporting, (5) the period during which any misconduct occurred, (6) any other negative repercussions experienced by the award recipient, (7) the period that has elapsed since the date of any misconduct and (8) the feasibility and costs of recovering the compensation. 
    
  Enforcement  .  The board intends that this policy will be applied to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  The Company has the authority to seek recovery through any available means including litigation or the filing of liens, if necessary.  The Company also has the authority, to the extent permitted by law, to deduct the amount to be repaid from any amounts otherwise owed to the recipient, including wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation paid.  Whether or not the Company elects to make any deduction, if the Company does not recover the full amount that it has determined should be recovered, the recipient must immediately repay the unpaid balance.  By agreeing to accept an award, each award recipient consents to the Company s right to make these deductions.

  Re:      Your 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan Award - Performance Stock Units 
  Dear David: 
  Congratulations.  As of September 26, 2016, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted you the following performance stock units ( PSUs ).  

The grant date fair value is calculated using the fair market value on the date of the award.  The awards were made under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the  Plan ).  We have attached a summary of the terms of your awards.  Please read it carefully. 
  I am pleased that you are a participant in this long-term incentive compensation program and trust that your participation will be beneficial to both you and the Company. 
    
  Sincerely, 
    
  Amanda Furiato 
  Senior Manager, Global Compensation 
    
  Enclosures 

Summary of Your Performance Stock Unit Award 
    
  What is a performance stock unit? 
    
  A PSU represents the conditional right to receive a distribution of shares.  The number of shares you will receive depends on how well the Company s actual performance compares to specified performance goals at the end of the performance period.     
    
  What are the performance goals applicable to the PSU award? 
    
  The performance levels are based on two equally weighted performance measures.  The two measures of Company performance are: 

Average return on invested capital - also called  ROIC  - is measured by dividing the average of the Company s net operating profit (without regard to taxes) over the performance period by the average outstanding equity plus debt over that period. 
                
    Compounded annual revenue growth - also called  CAGR  - is the compound annual growth rate in net sales for the Company over the same period. 
       
  What is the performance period for this PSU award? 
    
  The Company s performance against the goals is measured over a three-year period that begins January 1, 2016 and ends December 31, 2018. 
    
  Your target PSU award presented on the first page of this letter     is the number of shares of West Common Stock that you would receive if the Company obtains 100% of both of the ROIC and CAGR performance targets.  Additional shares of Common Stock will be distributed under this PSU award if actual performance exceeds the target performance level, and fewer shares of Common Stock will be distributable if actual performance falls short of the target performance level.  No shares of     Common Stock     will be paid out     if actual performance falls below the threshold level described below. 
    
  The following table shows the performance targets for CAGR and Average ROIC and the corresponding PSU payouts for the 2016-2018 performance period. 

If actual CAGR or ROIC falls between any of the performance range percentages above, the payout for that portion of your PSUs will be determined by applying a mathematical formula to estimate the value based on the two nearest percentages.   
    
  Can my PSU award be adjusted? 
    
  Yes, the Committee can change or revise the targets as it considers appropriate and make adjustments for budgeted exchange rates or an  extraordinary or special item   on a case-by-case basis.   Extraordinary or special items include (1) settlement of litigation or actions brought by governmental agencies , (2) changes to the Company s capital structure, including changes to dividend policy, share repurchase programs, mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, reorganizations and restructurings; and (3) new legislation or governmental regulations enacted or promulgated during the performance period. 

When will I know how many shares I am eligible to receive? 
    
  The shares will be distributed to you in early 2019 after the ROIC and CAGR for the performance period are calculated. This will be done by the Compensation Committee after review of the Company s audited financial statements. 
    
  Will I receive dividends on my PSUs? 
    
  During the performance period, your account will be credited with additional PSUs as if the target PSU award had been reinvested in dividends paid on Common Stock during the period.  At the end of the performance period, you may receive additional shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of PSUs credited through this dividend-reinvestment feature.  If performance falls below the target levels, you will forfeit some or all of these PSUs based on the applicable payout percentage. 
    
  May I defer receipt of my shares? 
    
  Delivery of shares upon payout may be deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan for eligible participants in certain countries.  If you are eligible, you will receive details on this deferral opportunity before the end of each performance period and the distribution provisions of the applicable plan will contain additional restrictions.  Any election will similarly defer receipt of additional shares you would otherwise receive due to the deemed dividend reinvestment feature. 
    
  What happens if I terminate employment during the performance period? 
    
  You will not be entitled to receive a distribution with respect to any PSUs granted by this award if your employment terminates for any reason other than a Qualifying Retirement (as defined above) before the end of the performance period. 
  What happens if I have a Qualifying Retirement during the performance period? 
    
  If you have a Qualifying Retirement during the performance period and after October 1, 2016, your PSUs will continue to vest based on the approved performance criteria as if you remained actively employed by the Company.  The same vesting cessation provisions applicable to your option awards upon a Qualifying Termination also apply to this award, including the Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy set forth in Exhibit I and the non-competition covenant set forth in Exhibit II. 
  Additional Information Applicable to Your PSU Award 
    
  Are there other circumstances that would lead to a forfeiture of my award or the proceeds that I receive from exercising my award? 
  Yes.  All awards are subject to our Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy, which is attached to this award letter as Exhibit I.  You are encouraged to carefully read that policy and contact me or the Law Department if you have any questions.  The policy generally provides that in addition to forfeitures of all or part of your award due to your termination of employment discussed above, in certain other situations you will forfeit your award and may be required to reimburse us for the amounts you receive as a result of any option that you exercise or share of stock that you sell.   Your acceptance of this award is expressly conditioned on your agreement to be subject to the Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy, including the provisions that allow us to deduct any proceeds from other sources of income payable to you.  This award would not be made if you did not agree to be subject to that policy.  
  The clawback period described in the Incentive Compensation Recovery policy is extended for the full duration of the period of continued vesting described in this award.  The Compensation Committee may determine in its sole and absolute discretion that if circumstances exist that would permit the recovery of incentive compensation paid to you during the vesting period, in addition to recovering this compensation, all vesting will immediately cease and the remainder of your awards will be forfeited immediately. 
    
  Does the Securities Trading Policy apply to my award?   
    
  Yes.  All sales of shares of company stock (including shares earned under the PS Unit award) are subject to our Securities Trading Policy.  Stock sales by West s officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 or on the designated persons list under our policy also must meet the review and written pre-approval by our General Counsel  

requirements of that policy.  For information and to access the required pre-clearance form, please go to   IntraWest   and look     under the     Legal   Compliance tab. 
    
  Does my acceptance of this award guarantee me any future awards, continued employment or additional severance pay? 
    
  No.  This award is granted at the sole discretion of West.  Your receipt of this award does not guarantee any future awards, nor does it guarantee your continued employment with the Company.  Subject to applicable law, your employment may be terminated for any reason.  Additionally, this award is not part of your base pay or compensation for determination of any severance pay or benefits you may be entitled to upon termination of employment unless that is specifically agreed to in writing between you and the Company. 
    
  Where can I find additional information about my award? 
    
  This is a summary of the terms of your PS Unit award.  Your award is subject to the terms of the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. This award is being delivered with an Information Statement, which gives additional information about your award and the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan under which it was granted.  We encourage you to read the Information Statement.  Additional terms and conditions may apply to your award under the terms of the Omnibus Plan.   

EXHIBIT I 
  Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy 
    
  The Company may seek to recover incentive compensation awarded to any recipient in accordance with the terms of this policy.  Each award of annual or long-term equity-based or performance-based compensation must specify that the award is subject to this policy. 
    
  Restatement of Financial Results  .  The Company will cancel or will seek to recover all or a portion of an award from any executive officer of the Company if the Company is required to significantly or materially restate its financial statements (other than to comply with changes to applicable accounting principles) with respect to any of the three fiscal years before the payment of the award.  The Company also will not pay or will seek to recover all or a portion of an award from any award recipient whose fraud or misconduct causes the restatement of the Company s financial statements with respect to any of the three fiscal years before the payment of the award. 
    
  Calculation Errors  .  Even if no financial results are restated, if an award is paid or distributed, and it is subsequently determined that the award should have been less than the amount calculated due to mathematical errors, fraud, misconduct or gross negligence, the Company may seek repayment of the award from any award recipient during the three-year period following the payment of the award. 
    
  Detrimental Conduct  .  If an award recipient directly or indirectly engages in conduct that competes with the Company, or any conduct that is materially inimical, contrary, harmful to, or not in the best interests of the Company or if the award recipient fails to comply with any of the material     terms and conditions of the award (unless the failure is remedied within ten days after having been notified of such failure), then the Company has the discretion to immediately cancel any and all outstanding awards and require that the award recipient repay all or any portion of an award, including the gain realized on the exercise of a stock option, stock appreciation right or the disposition of any other equity-based award.  To be subject to this policy, the detrimental conduct must have occurred while the award recipient was rendering service to the Company, or during the six-month period following the later of (1) the date the recipient ceases rendering service to the Company or, (2) the date the award is paid (or an option or stock appreciation right is exercised). 
    
  Exercise of Discretion  .  With respect to executive officers and members of the board of directors, the compensation committee has the sole and absolute authority (unless the board determines that the whole board should have such authority) to determine whether to exercise its discretion to seek repayment or cancel an award and what portion of an award should be recovered or canceled.  With respect to all other award recipients, the officers of the Company have sole and absolute authority.  The compensation committee, board or officers, as appropriate, will consider all relevant facts and circumstances in exercising their discretion.  These facts and circumstances include: (1) the materiality of any changes to calculations or financial results, (2) the potential windfall received by recipients, (3) the culpability and involvement of the award recipients, (4) the controls in place to limit misconduct or incorrect reporting, (5) the period during which any misconduct occurred, (6) any other negative repercussions experienced by the award recipient, (7) the period that has elapsed since the date of any misconduct and (8) the feasibility and costs of recovering the compensation. 
    
  Enforcement  .  The board intends that this policy will be applied to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  The Company has the authority to seek recovery through any available means including litigation or the filing of liens, if necessary.  The Company also has the authority, to the extent permitted by law, to deduct the amount to be repaid from any amounts otherwise owed to the recipient, including wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation paid.  Whether or not the Company elects to make any deduction, if the Company does not recover the full amount that it has determined should be recovered, the recipient must immediately repay the unpaid balance.  By agreeing to accept an award, each award recipient consents to the Company s right to make these deductions.

  Re:      Restricted Stock Unit ( RSU ) Award 
  Dear David: 
  Congratulations.  On 26-Sep-2016, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved an award under the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the  Plan ).   

The grant date fair value is calculated using the fair market value on the date of the award.  The awards were made under the Plan.  We have attached a summary of the terms of your awards.  Please read it carefully. 
  I am pleased that you are a participant in this long-term incentive compensation program and trust that your participation will be beneficial to both you and the Company. 
    
  Sincerely, 
    
  Amanda Furiato 
  Senior Manager, Global Compensation 
    
  Enclosures 

Summary of Your RSU 
    
  What is an RSU? 
    
  An RSU is the right to receive a share of the Company s Common stock in the future when the RSU vests as described in this Award.  It is   not   an issued share of stock until vested, and it can  not   be received in cash upon vesting. 
    
  Is the RSU immediately vested? 
    
  No.  So long as your employment with us continues (except as described below), your RSUs will vest - as per the schedule below.   

Will my RSUs vest if I terminate employment? 
    
  Your RSUs may become vested, depending on the reason for your termination.  Your RSUs will not become vested if you are terminated by the Company with Cause (as defined below) or you terminate employment with the Company without Good Reason (as defined below).  If you are terminated by the Company without Cause or you terminate with Good Reason, your RSUs will immediately 100% vest upon such termination   
    
   Cause  means (A) any willful failure by you to perform your duties or responsibilities or to comply with any valid and legal directives of your direct supervisor; (B) any act of fraud, embezzlement, theft or misappropriation of the funds of the Company by you, or your admission to or conviction of a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude, fraud, embezzlement, theft or misrepresentation; (C) your engagement in dishonesty, illegal conduct or misconduct that is materially injurious to the Company; (D) your breach of any material obligation under any written agreement between you and the Company; or (E) a material violation of a rule, policy, regulation or guideline imposed by the Company or a regulatory or self-regulatory body having jurisdiction over the Company. With respect to subsections (A), (D) and (E), the Company shall give you written notice of any alleged breach or violation of these subsections and afford you 30 days in which to remedy the condition. 
    
   Good Reason  means the occurrence of any of the following without your consent: (1) a material diminution in your base salary; (2) a material reduction in your duties, authority or responsibilities relative to your duties, authority, and responsibilities in effect immediately prior to such reduction; or (3) the relocation of your principal place of employment in a manner that lengthens by fifty (50) or more miles your one-way commuting distance to your place of employment; provided that a termination shall only be for Good Reason if: (a) within forty-five (45) calendar days of the initial existence of Good Reason, you provide written notice of Good Reason to the Company; (b) the Company does not remedy said Good Reason within thirty (30) calendar days of its receipt of such notice; and (c) you terminate employment within sixty (60) calendar days after the expiration of such 30-day remedy period.   
    
  Will my RSUs vest if I die or become disabled? 
    
  Yes. If you die or become disabled before the RSUs are 100% vested, you will immediately become vested in any unvested portion of the RSUs.   
    
  Will dividend equivalents be credited on the RSUs? 
    
  Yes.  When a dividend is paid on Company stock, the Company will credit to your account an additional number of RSUs.  The number of RSUs to be credited is determined by dividing the dividends paid in respect of the number of RSUs held by you on the relevant dividend record date by the fair market value of the Company s stock on that dividend record date and in accordance with the terms of the Plan.   
    
  May I vote my RSUs before they are vested? 
    
  No. Before the shares are vested, they are not issued.  Following vesting, when shares are delivered, you will be permitted to vote these shares. 

May I make an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) with respect to the RSUs? 
    
  No.  Because an RSU is a promise to deliver property in the future, it is not subject to Section 83(b) of the Code.   
  When will the RSU be included in my income? 
    
  The value of the RSU will only be included in your income upon vesting.  Shares may be withheld in accordance with the Plan to satisfy our withholding obligations. 
    
  May I defer my RSUs? 
    
  No.  These RSUs are not eligible for further deferral under our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan or 401(k) plan. 
    
  Additional Information Applicable to Your RSUs 
  Are there other circumstances that would lead to a forfeiture of my award or the proceeds that I receive from exercising my award? 
  Yes.  All awards are subject to our Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy, which is attached to this award letter as Exhibit I.  You are encouraged to carefully read that policy and contact me or the Law Department if you have any questions.  The policy generally provides that in addition to forfeitures of all or part of your award due to your termination of employment discussed above, in certain other situations you will forfeit your award and may be required to reimburse us for the amounts you receive as a result of any option that you exercise or share of stock that you sell.   Your acceptance of this award is expressly conditioned on your agreement to be subject to the Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy, including the provisions that allow us to deduct any proceeds from other sources of income payable to you.  This award would not be made if you did not agree to be subject to that policy.

The Compensation Committee may determine in its sole and absolute discretion that if circumstances exist that would permit the recovery of incentive compensation paid to you during the vesting period, in addition to recovering this compensation, all vesting will immediately cease and the remainder of your awards will be forfeited immediately. 
    
  Does the Securities Trading Policy apply to my award?   
    
  Yes.  All sales of shares of company stock (including RSUs and shares received upon exercise of the Retention Option) and all option exercise transactions are subject to our Securities Trading Policy.  Option exercises and stock sales by West s officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 or on the designated persons list under our policy also must meet the review and written pre-approval by our General Counsel requirements of that policy.  For information and to access the required pre-clearance form, please go to   IntraWest   and look     under the     Legal   Compliance tab.

  provided, however  , that if at any time before the third anniversary of a Separation from Service, the Executive either (x) elects retirement under the Retirement Plan, or (y) reaches normal retirement age under the Retirement Plan, if the Executive had remained employed by the Company, then the Executive s severance compensation under this Section 3(a) will be reduced by an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying such severance compensation by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from the Separation from Service until the date on which either of the events described in clauses (x) or (y) first occurs, and the denominator of which is 1095. 
  Except as set forth in Section 3(e), the severance compensation paid hereunder will not be reduced to the extent of any other compensation for the Executive s services that the Executive receives or is entitled to receive from any other employment consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

    Equivalent of Vested Savings/Deferred Comp Plan Benefit  .   The Company will pay to the Executive the difference, if any, between

           (d) 
    Employee and Executive Benefits  .    The Executive will be entitled to a continuation of all hospital, medical, dental, and similar insurance benefits not otherwise addressed in this Agreement in the same manner and amount to which the Executive was entitled on the date of a Change in Control or on the date of Constructive Termination of the Executive s employment (whichever benefits are more favorable to the Executive) until the earlier of: 
       
           (i) 
    a period of 36 months after the Separation from Service,

           (iii) 
    the Executive s eligibility for similar benefits with a new employer. 
       
  Assistance in finding new employment will be made available to the Executive by the Company if the Executive so requests.  Upon the Separation from Service, Company cars must be returned to the Company.

           4. 
    Excise Tax Limitation. 
       
           (a) 
    Limitation  .

           (b) 
    Determination of Application of the Limitation  .  Subject to the provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required under this Section 4 shall be made by the accounting firm that was the Company s independent auditors immediately prior to the Change in Control (or, in default thereof, an accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Executive) (the    Accounting Firm   ), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Executive and the Company within fifteen days of the Change in Control,  

the Separation from Service or any other date reasonably requested by the Executive or the Company on which a determination under this Section 4 is necessary or advisable.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, the Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide the Executive with an opinion that the Accounting Firm has substantial authority under the Code and Regulations not to report an Excise Tax on the Executive s federal income tax return.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Executive and the Company.   
    
           (c) 
    Procedures  .  The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would result in Payments that would be less on an after-tax basis than had those payments been limited under Section 4(a).  Such notice shall be given as soon as practicable after the Executive knows of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim is requested to be paid.  the Executive agrees not to pay the claim until the expiration of the thirty-day period following the date on which the Executive notifies the Company, or such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with respect to such claim are due (the    Notice Period   ).  If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of the Notice Period that it desires to contest the claim, the Executive shall:  (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to the claim; (ii) take such action in connection with the claim as the Company may reasonably request, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive; (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to the claim.  The Executive shall permit the Company to control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit the Company to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings, and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim.  If requested by the Company, the Executive agrees either to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner and to prosecute such contest to a determination  before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts as the Company shall determine;   provided  ,   however  , that, if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and pursue a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an after-tax and interest-free basis (the    Advance   ).  The Company s control of the contest related to the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Payments and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.  The Advance or other payments and the reimbursement of any related costs, expenses or taxes payable under this Section 4(c) and/or Section 4(e) shall be made on or before the end of the Executive s taxable year following the taxable year in which any additional taxes are payable by the Executive or if no additional taxes are payable the Executive s taxable year following the taxable year in which the audit or litigation is closed.  Notwithstanding the above, to the extent required to avoid the penalty taxes and interest payable under section 409A of the Code, if the Executive is a  specified person  within the meaning of that Code section, the Advance shall be delayed until the date that is six months following the Separation from Service. 
       
           (d) 
    Repayments  .  If, after receipt by the Executive of an Advance, the Executive becomes entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance relates, the Executive shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If, after receipt by the Executive of an Advance, a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and the Company does not promptly notify the Executive of its intent to contest the denial of refund, then the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by the Executive.   
       
           (e) 
    Further Assurances  .  The Company shall indemnify the Executive and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any costs, expenses, penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities (   Losses   ) incurred by the Executive with respect to the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this Section 4, including, without limitation, any Losses related to the Company s decision to contest a claim or any imputed income to the Executive resulting from any Advance or action taken on the Executive s behalf by the Company hereunder.  Subject to the last sentence of Section 4(c), the Company shall pay all legal fees and expenses incurred under this Section 4 and shall promptly reimburse the Executive for the reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with any actions taken by the Company or required to be taken by the Executive hereunder.  The Company shall also pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses related to the opinion referred to in Section 4(b). 

5. 
    Payment of Severance Compensation  .  The severance compensation set forth in Section 3(a) will be payable in 36 equal monthly installments commencing on the first day of the month following the month in which the Separation from Service occurs.  Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Code section 409A, the first six monthly installments shall be paid in a lump sum on the first day of the month following or coincident with the date that is six months following the Separation from Service and all remaining monthly installments shall be paid monthly. 
       
           6. 
    Legal Fees  .  The Company will pay all legal fees and expenses which the Executive may incur as a result of the Company s contesting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement. 
       
           7. 
    Payments Final  .  In the event of a termination of the Executive s employment under the circumstances described in this Agreement, the arrangements provided for by this Agreement, and any other agreement between the Company and the Executive in effect at that time and by any other applicable plan of the Company in which the Executive then participates, will constitute the entire obligation of the Company to the Executive, and performance of that obligation will constitute full settlement of any claim that the Executive might otherwise assert against the Company on account of such termination. The Company s obligation to pay the Executive under this Agreement will be absolute and unconditional and will not be affected by any circumstance, including without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, defense or other rights the Company may have against the Executive or anyone else as long as the Executive is not in beach of the Executive s obligations under this Agreement. 
       
           8. 
    Non-Competition  . 
       
           (a) 
    During the one-year period following the Executive s termination of employment covered by this Agreement, the Executive will not, and will not permit any of the Executive's Affiliates, or any other Person, directly or indirectly, to: 
       
           (i)
