ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS 

Business
Operations 

The
Company sells frozen yogurt and fudge bars to retailers with stores
in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island
and Vermont. The Company intends to expand its regional growth to a
national level and global presence in sales of premium quality
low-fat, low calorie, low-carbohydrate, vitamin and probiotic
enriched frozen yogurt and products under the brand name
 Jala . 

2.
GOING CONCERN 

The
Company s financial statements are prepared using generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of
assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has not yet established revenues sufficient
to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going
concern. The Company has incurred significant net losses since
inception and at September 30, 2016, has an accumulated deficit of
($18,567,671) and stockholders  deficit of ($2,197,395). The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating
expenses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to
obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease
operations. 

In
order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among
other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan
is to obtain such resources for the Company through sales of its
products in combination with equity and/or debt financing. As
indicated in Note 8, the Company obtained approximately $425,000,
$250,000 and $500,000 of gross proceeds from the debt offerings on
December 31, 2014, September 21, 2015 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, and currently has limited working capital necessary
for sales and production, accordingly there can be no assurance
that the Company can continue as a going concern. 

The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a
going concern. 

3.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements and related notes have
been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ( GAAP ) and with the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for
complete financial statements presentation. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary to present fairly the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for interim
financial statements have been included. This Form 10-Q should be
read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interim results are not
necessarily indicative of the results for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2016. 

The
financial statements reflect a 1 per 1,000 reverse stock split of
all outstanding common and preferred stock, which was effective
immediately prior to the completion of the December 2015 Securities
Purchase Agreement (see Note 8). All share and per share data
reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements
have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the reverse
stock split.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some
of the more significant estimates required to be made by management
include the fair value of derivatives and other stockholders'
equity based transactions. 

Reclassification 

Certain
items in the 2015 financials have been reclassified to conform to
the 2016 presentation. 

Financial Instruments  

The
Company considers the carrying amounts of financial instruments,
including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued
expenses to approximate their fair values because of their
relatively short maturities. The fair value of convertible notes
payable approximate their face value. 

Fair
value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for
an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy based
on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered
observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure
fair value which are the following: 

Level 1
  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are
accessible at measurement date for identical assets or
liabilities. 

Level 2
- Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities. 

Level 3
- Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities and less observable from objective
sources. 

The
Company s derivative liabilities (see Note 9) are valued at
each reporting period using level 3 inputs. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
The Company maintains cash balances at one financial institution.
The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
Federal legislation provides for FDIC insurance of up to
$250,000. 

Accounts
Receivable 

Accounts receivable
consist of amounts due from customers. The Company records an
allowance for doubtful receivables, if necessary, to allow for any
amounts which may be unrecoverable. The allowance is based upon an
analysis of the Company s prior collection experience,
customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. Account
balances are written off against the allowance after all means of
collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is
considered remote. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
no allowance for doubtful accounts was required.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

Inventory 

Inventory consists
primarily of packaging, raw materials and finished goods held for
distribution. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market. In evaluating whether inventory is stated at
the lower of cost or market, management considers such factors as
the amount of inventory on hand and the distribution channel, the
estimated time to sell such inventory, remaining shelf life and the
current expected market conditions. Adjustments to reduce inventory
to its net realizable value are charged to cost of goods
sold. 

Shipping
and Handling Costs 

The
Company classifies shipping and handling costs as part of selling
expense. Shipping and handling costs were $1,019 and $1,019 and
$5,810 and $14,816 for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Debt
Issue Cost 

Debt
issue costs related to costs incurred in connection with the
issuance of convertible notes, and are being amortized on the
straight-line method (which approximates the effective interest
method) over the term of the respective notes payable. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, debt issuance costs, net of
accumulated amortization of $51,000 and $9,375 amounted to $17,000
and $96,125, respectively. Debt issuance costs are now shown on the
accompanying balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of the secured converible notes payable (see Note
8). 

Property
and Equipment 

Property and
equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives using the straight-line method. 

Maintenance and
repairs are charged to operating expenses as they are incurred.
Improvements and betterments, which extend the lives of the assets,
are capitalized. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets
retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from the appropriate
accounts and any profit or loss on the sale or disposition of such
assets is credited or charged to income. 

Derivative
Liabilities 

The
Company s derivative liabilities are related to the ratchet
reset provisions of the Company s warrants and convertible
debt. Such ratchet reset provisions prohibit the Company from
concluding that the warrants are indexed to their own stock, and
thus derivative accounting is appropriate. For derivative
instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative
instrument is initially recorded at its fair market value and is
then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in fair value
recognized in operations for each reporting period. The Company
uses the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Model to value the derivative
instruments of its  outstanding stock warrants at inception
and subsequent valuation dates and in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) 815, and a binomial
valuation model in connection with its  convertible
debt. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue
is recognized, net of discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments,
price adjustments, slotting fees and estimated returns, upon
transfer of title and risk to the customer which occurs at shipping
(F.O.B. terms). Upon shipment, the Company has no further
performance obligations.

Share-Based
Compensation 

The
Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment
awards made to employees, directors and others based on the
estimated fair values on the date of the grant, as subsequently
adjusted for certain contingently issuable shares. Common stock
equivalents are valued using the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Model
using the known or equivalent market value of common stock on the
date of valuation, an expected dividend yield of zero, the
remaining period or maturity date of the common stock equivalent
and the expected volatility of common stock. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740  
 Income Taxes , which
requires the use of an assets and liabilities approach in
accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recorded based on the differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates
in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is provided when realization of deferred tax
assets is not considered more likely than not. 

The
Company s policy is to classify income tax assessments, if
any, for interest in interest expense and for penalties in general
and administrative expenses. 

As of
September 30, 2016, management has evaluated and concluded that
there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring
recognition in the Company's consolidated financial
statements. 

The
Company s income tax returns since 2012 are subject to
examination by the tax authorities. 

Advertising
Costs 

Advertising costs
are expensed as incurred. Total advertising was $0 and $853 and
$2,835 and $2,835 for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that creates new
accounting and reporting guidelines for leasing arrangements. The
new guidance requires organizations that lease assets to recognize
assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights
and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they
are classified as finance or operating leases. The new standard is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with
early application permitted. The new standard is to be applied
using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the
process of evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its
consolidated financial statements. 

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
accounting guidance, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." The
core principle of the new standard is for companies to recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in
amounts that reflect the consideration (that is, payment) to which
the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. The standard will be effective for fiscal years and
interim periods within those years beginning after December 15,
2017. Accordingly, the Company will adopt this standard in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the consolidated
financial statements. 

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of
Financial Statements-Going Concern". This ASU is intended to define
management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is
substantial doubt about an organization's ability to continue as a
going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. It is
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect it to
have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
the associated debt liability. Also in August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and
Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with
Line-of-Credit Arrangements , to clarify that the Securities
and Exchange Commission staff would not object to deferring and
presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently
amortizing deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of
the line-of-credit arrangement. This guidance is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The
guidance is required to be retrospectively applied to all prior
periods. The Company adopted these ASUs in the first quarter of
2016. As a result, the Company presents debt issuance costs as a
reduction of secured convertible notes payable. 

All
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the
FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not
expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements upon adoption.

INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE 

Basic
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income or
loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Fully diluted income (loss) per share is computed similar
to basic income (loss) per share except that the denominator for
fully diluted income per share is increased to include the number
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
potential common shares had been issued in order to present their
dilutive effect unless the effect of such potential shares would be
antidilutive. Potential common shares consist of incremental common
shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants, convertible
preferred shares and convertible notes payable. In addition, in
computing net income (loss) per share on a fully diluted basis, the
Company adjusts for the interest expense on convertible debt as if
the debt had been converted for all periods presented. 

As at
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the number of potential dilutive
common shares is comprised of the following:

DUE TO OFFICERS/STOCKHOLDERS 

On

from its $25,555 loan obligation to him which was recorded as
forgiveness of debt income for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
repaid approximately $110,000 of advances received in 2015. In
August 2016, two of the executive officers advanced the Company a
total of $8,285 to fund expenses due.

SECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE 

On
December 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase
Agreement ( 2014 Agreement ) with certain accredited
investors to sell to the Purchasers an aggregate of up to $500,000
of principal amount of notes due December 31, 2015 representing the
Purchasers  subscription amount. The 2014 Agreement defines
certain covenants and provides for a purchase price reset for a
period of three years, unless the securities have been assigned,
whereby should the Company issue or sell any shares of common stock
or any common stock equivalents at a price less than the
Purchasers  conversion price per share, the Company will be
required to issue additional shares of common stock to the
Purchasers for no additional consideration resulting in a share
dilution adjustment, as defined. The 2014 Agreement also provides a
Most Favored Nations Provision whereby if the Company issues or
sells any common stock at terms more favorable within three years,
then the Company will be required to amend the 2014 Agreement to
provide such favorable terms to the Purchasers. The Company paid
$33,000 in legal and escrow agent fees, a placement agency fee of
$20,000 in the form of a note payable, substantially similar to the
Purchasers  notes and issued 64,000 shares of its common
stock valued at $640,000 and $20,000 as due diligence fees, all of
which have been recorded as debt issuance costs on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and was charged to operations
over the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The Company
recorded amortization expense of $0 and $0 and $178,250 and
$534,750 on the debt issuance costs during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December
31, 2015 the maturity date of the notes were extended to December
31, 2016. 

Under
the 2014 Agreement, the Company sold an aggregate of $425,000 in
Secured Convertible Notes ( Notes ) and issued an
additional $20,000 Note for placement fees. The Company fulfilled
its obligations as defined by certain equity requirements;
therefore, the Notes will be convertible into shares of the
Company s common stock. Under certain conditions defined in
the agreement, the Company has the option to convert the Notes into
shares of the Company's common stock. Since the equity obligations
were met during 2015 the Notes accrued interest at 10% per annum
through June 30, 2015. The original conversion price on the Note
was $6.00, and has subsequently reduced to $0.30 at December 31,
2015. 

During
the first nine months of 2016, the Company issued 875,000 shares of
its common stock in connection with the conversion of $265,500 of
Notes. In accordance with the accounting for debt extinguishment,
the difference between the $262,500 carrying value of the Notes,
plus the associated embedded derivative liability of $122,982 and
the $176,750 fair value of 875,000 shares of common stock issued,
resulted in a net gain of $208,732. 

Each
Holder of the Notes has been granted a security interest in assets
of the Company in accordance with a Security Agreement. The
Security Agreement provides the Collateral Agent a security
interest in all goods, machinery, equipment, contract rights and
intangibles in the event of a default under the
Agreement. 

In
connection with this 2014 Agreement, and under the anti-dilution
provisions of the February 2014 private placement, on December 31,
2014, the Company issued an aggregate of 160,093 shares of common
stock and 13,333 warrants to purchase common shares at $6.00 per
share to existing stockholders holding securities purchased in that
offering. This reflects the post-split adjustment to shares issued
and price per share. The fair value of the 13,333 warrants issued
in 2014 were valued at $122,807 using the Black-Scholes Pricing
model and was reflected as a change in the derivative liability in
the 2014 statement of operations. 

In
addition, the pricing of this 2014 Agreement triggered the pricing
reset provision in the 3,333 warrants issued in the February 14,
2014 private placement. Such triggering resulted in the exercise
price of the previously issued warrants resetting to $6.00 from
$30.00 at December 31, 2014. The exercise price was further reduced
to $0.30 as a result of additional financing in 2015. At September
30, 2016, using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model, the Company
re-valued the remaining February 2014 warrants at $276 a decrease
in fair value of $1,315 from December 31, 2015 and a decrease in
fair value of $570,723 since inception. 

At
September 30, 2016, the 13,333 ratchet warrants granted at December
31, 2014 were re-valued using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model at
$1,290, a decrease in fair value of $5,343 from December 31,
2015.

Derivative Liabilities 

The
Company has determined that the convertible notes issued on
December 31, 2014, September 21, 2015 and December 31, 2015 contain
provisions that protect holders from future issuances of the
Company s common stock at prices below such convertible
notes  respective conversion price and these provisions
result in modification of the conversion price to issue additional
common shares based on a variable that is not an input to the fair
value of a  fixed-for-fixed  option as defined under
FASB ASC Topic No. 815   40 and the conversion feature
represents an embedded derivative that requires
bifurcation.

A
summary of the derivative liability at September 30, 2016 is
summarized as follows: 

The
derivative liability at September 30, 2016 consists of debt
conversion of $45,840   ($2,224,361 - 2015)
and warrants of $1,566 ($8,224 - 2015). 

Accounting
for Convertible Debt 

Under
the initial accounting for the December 2014 Offering, the Company
allocated the proceeds to the embedded conversion derivative
liability, which exceeded the $445,000 face amount of the
convertible debt at the issuance date. The proceeds allocated to
the embedded conversion derivative liability were recognized as a
discount to the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2014, the
Company recorded aggregate debt discounts of $445,000 related to
the conversion rights and recorded $149,963 of expense related to
the excess value of the derivative over the face amount of the
convertible debt. 

Under
the September 21, 2015 offering the Company allocated the proceeds
to the embedded conversion derivative liability, which exceeded the
$275,000 face amount of the additional convertible debt at the
issuance date. 

Under
the December 31, 2015 offering the Company allocated the proceeds
to the embedded conversion derivative liability, which exceeded the
$550,000 face amount of the additional convertible debt at the
issuance date. 

As a
result, upon issuance of the two 2015 debt offerings, the Company
recorded a debt discount of $825,000 and recorded a loss of
$614,432 related to the excess value of the $1,439,432 derivative
over the $825,000 face amount of the convertible debt. 

The
debt discount is accreted to interest expense over the life of the
convertible debentures using an effective interest method. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company amortized $71,418 and $635,698 and $161,332 and $ 427,153,
respectively, of the debt discount. In addition, amortization of
deferred debt issuance costs amounted to $26,375 and $79,125 and
$178,250 and $534,750 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

pursuant to a Subscription Agreement, an aggregate of 33,333 shares
of its common stock, 26,667 shares of the Series C Preferred Stock
and five year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 59,999

warrants or underlying the Series C Preferred Stock, in the event
the Company issues or sells common stock at a per share price equal
to less than $30.00 per share, as adjusted, the Company has agreed
to issue additional securities such that the aggregate purchase
price paid by the investor shall equal the lower price issuance,
subject to certain exceptions, as defined. The Company recorded a
derivative liability related to the reset feature on the exercise
price of the warrants to purchase common stock issued by the
Company. 

In
connection with the Offering, the Company granted the investors
 piggy-back  registration rights and the investors are
entitled to a right of participation in future financings conducted
by the Company for a period of twenty-four months. 

In 2014
the Company paid placement agent fees of $144,000 in cash, issued
an aggregate of 600, shares of the Company s common stock and
issued a five year warrant to purchase up to 5,399 shares of the

Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock 

In
April 2013, the Company s Board of Directors authorized four
(4) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share as
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series B Preferred
Stock ) and issued one share of Series B Preferred Stock to
each of the Company s three senior members of management.
Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is entitled such number of
votes on all matters submitted to stockholders that is equal to (i)
the product of (a) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
held by such holder, (b) the number of issued and outstanding
shares of the Company s Common Stock (taking into account the
effective outstanding voting rights of the Series B Preferred
Stock), as of the record date for the vote and (c) 0.13334 less
(ii) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially held by such
holder on such date. Additionally, on the six month anniversary
date of issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock, each outstanding
share of Series B Preferred Stock was to automatically, and without
further action on the part of the holder, convert into such number
of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock as would
cause the holder to own, along with any other securities of the
Company s beneficially owned on the conversion date by them
13.334% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, calculated on
the conversion date. On October 25, 2013, the Company amended and
restated the Certificate of Designation for Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock to extend the date on which the Series B Shares
would automatically convert into such number of fully paid and
non-assessable shares of common stock, from the date six months
from the date of issuance (October 26, 2013) to the twelfth month
anniversary of the date of issuance of the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock (April 26, 2014) which on April 22, 2014, was
further extended to an indefinite date. The Company previously
recorded the three shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
as stock-based compensation using the then current estimate of the
number of shares that would convert to shares of common stock of
the Company based on the shares outstanding and current price per
share at each balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2014, the
Company recalculated the estimated shares issuable to be 216,670
and recorded stock-based compensation of $2,166,707 for the year
then ended. The estimate is based on the current common shares
outstanding at December 31, 2014, a stock price of $10.00 per
share, and is subject to adjustment based on any additional common
shares issued.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW 

Be Active Holdings, Inc. f/k/a Superlight, Inc. ( we ,
 Be Active  or the  Company ) was
incorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 27, 2007. On
December 28, 2012, the Company amended and restated its Certificate
of Incorporation to change its name from  Super Light
Inc.  to  Be Active Holdings, Inc.  

Since inception and until our merger with Be Active Brands, Inc.
( Be Active Brands ) on January 9, 2013, as further
described herein, we conducted market analysis on diaper usage in
our target market, researched governmental regulations for the
importing of such products, and negotiated pricing with possible
suppliers. 

Prior to the merger, the business we currently operate was
conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary Be Active Brands. The
discussion of our business both before and after the merger in this
Form 10-Q is that of our current business which was and continues
to be conducted through Be Active Brands. 

Be Active Brands was organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware on March 10, 2009. The Company manufactures and sells low
fat, low calorie, all natural probiotic enriched frozen yogurt and
ice cream under the trade name "Jala" and has trademarked its Jala
cow logo. Its frozen yogurt is packaged as low fat sandwiches and

Recent Developments 

On
April 20, 2016 the Company issued 100,000 shares of the Company's

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued
875,000 shares of its common stock in connection with the

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
the associated debt liability. Also in August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and
Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with
Line-of-Credit Arrangements , to clarify that the Securities
and Exchange Commission staff would not object to deferring and
presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently
amortizing deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of
the line-of-credit arrangement. This guidance is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The
guidance is required to be retrospectively applied to all prior
periods. The Company adopted these ASUs in the first quarter of
2016. As a result, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the
Company presents $17,000 and $96,125 of debt issuance costs as a
reduction of secured convertible notes payable,
respectively.

Placement or (ii) such time as no February Investor holds any
Shares, Warrants, or shares of common stock underlying Warrants or

we issue or sell common stock or common stock equivalents at a per
share price equal to less than $30.00 share, as adjusted, we agreed
to issue additional Shares such that the aggregate purchase price
paid by such February Investor shall equal such lower price
issuance, subject to certain customary exceptions. 

Each

the option of the holder at any time, into 100 shares of common
stock and has a stated value of $0.0001 per share. The conversion
ratio of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to
adjustment in the case of stock splits, stock dividends,
combination of shares and similar recapitalization
transactions.

Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the date
of issuance and have an exercise price of $0.30 share, subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events such as lower
priced issuances, stock splits and dividends.

connection with the February Private Placement, we granted the
February Investors  piggy-back  registration rights.
Additionally, February Investors are entitled to a right of

On
December 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase
Agreement ( Agreement ) with certain accredited
investors to sell to the Purchasers an aggregate of up to $500,000
of principal amount of notes due December 31, 2015 representing the
Purchasers  subscription amount. The Agreement defines
certain covenants and provides for a purchase price reset for a
period of three years, unless the securities have been assigned,
whereby should the Company issue or sell any shares of common stock
or any common stock equivalents at a price less than the
Purchasers  conversion price per share, the Company will be
required to issue additional shares of common stock to the
Purchasers for no additional consideration resulting in a share
dilution adjustment, as defined. The Agreement also provides a Most
Favored Nations Provision whereby if the Company issues or sells
any common stock at terms more favorable within three years, then
the Company will be required to amend the Agreement to provide such
favorable terms to the Purchasers. The Company paid $33,000 in
legal and escrow agent fees, a placement agency fee of $20,000 in
the form of a note payable, substantially similar to the
Purchasers  notes and issued 64,000 shares of its common
stock valued at $640,000 and $20,000 as due diligence fees, all of
which have been recorded as debt issue costs on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and is being charged to
operations over the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 or the
date of conversion, if earlier.  The Company recorded
amortization expense of $0 and $0 and $178,250 and $534,750 on the
debt issuance costs during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2015 the
maturity date of the notes were extended to December 31,
2016. 

Under
the Agreement, the Company sold an aggregate of $425,000 in Secured
Convertible Notes ( Notes ) and an additional $20,000
Note for placement fees. The Company fulfilled its obligations as
defined by certain equity requirements, therefore the Notes will be
convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at the
option of the Company. Since the equity obligations were met during
2015, the Notes accrued interest at 10%, per annum through June
2015. The original conversion price on the Note was $6.00 and has
subsequently reduced to $0.30 at December 31, 2015. 

During
the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 875,000
shares of its common stock in connection with the conversion of
$262,500 of Notes. In accordance with the accounting for debt
extinguishment, the difference between the $262,500 carrying value
of the Notes, plus the associated embedded derivative liability of
$122,982 and the $176,750 fair value of 875,000 shares of common
stock issued, resulted in a net  gain of
$208,732.  

Each
Holder of the Notes has been granted a security interest in assets
of the Company in accordance with a Security Agreement. The
Security Agreement provides the Collateral Agent a security
interest in all goods, machinery, equipment, contract rights and
intangibles in the event of a default under the
Agreement. 

In
connection with the transaction, and under its anti-dilution
provisions of the February 2014 private placement the Company
issued an aggregate of 160,093, shares of common stock and 13,333
warrants to purchase common shares at $6.00 per share to existing
shareholders holding securities purchased in that offering. This
reflects the post-split adjustment to shares issued and the price
per share. The face value the 13,333 warrants issued in 2014 were
valued at $122,807 using the Black Scholes Pricing model and was
reflected as a change in the derivative liability in the 2014
statement of operations. 

On
September 21, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase
Agreement ( Sept 2015 Agreement ) with certain
accredited investors to sell to the Purchasers an aggregate of up
to $250,000 of principal amount of notes due September 30, 2016,

principal amount of the Notes ("Allonges") pursuant to the terms of
the new offering with such Allonges having a maturity date of
September 30, 2016 and a conversion price equal to $1.00 per share
(subject to further reduction), at September 21, 2015. The
conversion price was reduced to $0.30 at December 31, 2015 as a
result of a subsequent financing. 

The September 2015 Agreement
defines certain covenants and provides for a purchase price reset
for a period of three years, unless the securities have been
assigned, whereby should the Company issue or sell any shares of
common stock or any common stock equivalents at a price less than
the Purchasers  conversion price per share, the Company will
be required to issue additional shares of common stock to the
Purchasers for no additional consideration resulting in a share
dilution adjustment, as defined. The September 2015 Agreement also
provides a Most Favored Nations Provision whereby if the Company
issues or sells any common stock at terms more
favorable     within
three years, then the Company will be required to amend the
September 2015 Agreement to provide such favorable terms to the

intangibles in the event of a default under the
Agreement. 

On
December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase
Agreement ( December 2015 Agreement ) with certain
accredited investors to sell to the Purchasers an aggregate of up
to $500,000 of principal amount of notes due December 31 2016,
representing the Purchasers  subscription amount. The new
offering is substantially the same terms and conditions as the
December 2014 Notes. 

The December 2015 Agreement defines certain
covenants and provides for a purchase price reset for a period of
three years, unless the securities have been assigned, whereby
should the Company issue or sell any shares of common stock or any
common stock equivalents at a price less than the Purchasers 
conversion price per share, the Company will be required to issue
additional shares of common stock to the Purchasers for no
additional consideration resulting in a share dilution adjustment,
as defined. The December 2015 Agreement also provides a Most
Favored Nations Provision whereby if the Company issues or sells
any common stock at terms more favorable     within three years, then the Company will be
required to amend the December 2015 Agreement to provide such
favorable terms to the Purchasers. The Company paid $18,000 in
legal fees, a placement agency fee of $50,000 in the form of a note
payable, with substantially similar to the Purchasers  notes,
all of which was recorded as debt issuance costs on the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and will
be charged to operations over the twelve months ended December 31,
2016 or to the date of conversion, if earlier.  The Company
recorded amortization expense of $17,000 and $51,000 on the debt
issuance costs during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016. 

Under
the December 2015 Agreement, the Company sold an aggregate of
$500,000 in Secured Convertible Notes ( Notes ) and
issued an additional $50,000 Note for placement fees. Once the
Company has fulfilled its obligations as defined by certain equity
requirements, the Notes will be convertible into shares of the
Company s common stock at the option of the Company. Until
the equity obligations are met, the Notes bear interest at 10%, per
annum. Interest will be earned at a rate of 10% for the twelve
months ending December 31, 2016 or to the date of conversion,
whichever is earlier. The conversion price for the Note and accrued
interest is equal to $0.30 per share, subject to adjustments as
stock dividends and stock splits, as defined. 

Each
Holder of the Notes has been granted a security interest in assets
of the Company in accordance with a Security Agreement. The
Security Agreement provides the Collateral Agent a security
interest in all goods, machinery, equipment, contract rights and
intangibles in the event of a default under the
Agreement. 

In
connection with the September 2015 and December 2015 Agreements and
under the anti-dilution provisions of the December
2014 private placement the Company is required to issue an
aggregate of 2,611,003 shares, of common stock to existing
stockholders holding securities purchased in that offering, of
which 1,918,002 were issued as of September 30, 2016.

liability, gain on settlement of secured convertible notes payable,
and depreciation and amortization expense for the three months

a loss of $383,229 for the three months ended September 30, 2015,
an increase in income of $796,723. This increase is due primarily

decrease in general and administrative expense of $20,429 and the
gain of $118,569 recognized on the conversion of notes payable for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in fair
value of derivative liability from 2015 to 2016 resulted from the
input changes in the pricing models used to determine fair values,
as well as the conversion of secured convertible notes payable into
common stock during 2016. 

Selling expenses consist primarily of advertising, promotion and
marketing fees. Selling expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased to $2,579 from $56,453 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, an decrease of ($53,874) or 96%.
The decrease is primarily due to decreases in  marketing
expense of ($21,064), freight out of ($4,791), storage expenses of
($6,736) and travel and entertainment of ($18,106). 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of office,

administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30,
2016 decreased to $193,796 from $214,225 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, a decrease of $20,429 or 10%. The decrease is
primarily attributable to decrease in outside services and decrease
in commissions. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other (expense) decreased to ($118,.418) for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to other (expense) of ($290,193) for
the three months ended September 30, 2015  .   This decrease of $171,775 in expense is the result
of an decrease in expense in amortization of deferred financing
costs and debt discount of $191,714 and increase in interest
expense $19,939 all incurred as a result of the capital raise in
December 2015 and September 2015.  

Net Income (Loss) 

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased
to $221,317 from a loss of ($661,298), an increase in income of
$882,615. This increase is due primarily to decrease in gross sales
of ($104,808), a decrease in the decrease of fair value of
derivative liability of $603,817, decrease in selling expenses of
($53,874), increase in gain on settlement of secured convertible
notes payable of $118,569 and a decrease in other expenses of
($171,775). 

Income (Loss) per Common Share 

Basic income or (loss) per share for the three month periods ending
September 30, 2016 and 2015 is calculated using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each
period. Fully diluted income (loss) per share is computed similar
to basic income (loss) per share except that the denominator for
fully diluted income per share is increased to include the number
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
potential common shares had been issued in order to present their
dilutive effect. Potential common shares consist of incremental
common shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants and
convertible preferred shares. Diluted loss per share excludes the
shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants and convertible
preferred stock from the calculation of net loss per share as their
effect would be anti-dilutive.

Total current assets at September 30, 2016 were

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

derivative instruments that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future material effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
We have certain warrants and options outstanding but we do not
expect to receive sufficient proceeds from the exercise of these
instruments unless and until the trading price of our common stock
is significantly greater than the applicable exercise prices of the
options and warrants and mainly following any necessary registering
of underlying securities.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

At the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this
evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were 

not effective   t  o ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
are: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and
(ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our  

President and Chief Financial Officer, or officers performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Our internal control over financial reporting is not currently
effective due to the following: 

Currently there is a lack of proper segregation of functions,
duties and responsibilities with respect to our cash and control
over the related disbursements due to our limited staff and
accounting personnel. Management is aware that there is a lack of
segregation of duties due to the small number of employees dealing
with administrative and financial matters. In the future,
management intends to continue to utilize additional staff to
handle certain administrative financial duties. 

-30- 

Table of Contents  

In addition, the Company s limited accounting staff may not
allow for us to properly account for complex accounting
transactions, which could lead to a material misstatement of our
financial statements. 

Finally, there has been a lack of controls over the control
environment in that the Board of Directors is comprised of three
members who are officers of the Company. As of yet, there is no
formal audit committee and no compensation committee. As the
Company matures, management will continue to expand the Board of
Directors.
