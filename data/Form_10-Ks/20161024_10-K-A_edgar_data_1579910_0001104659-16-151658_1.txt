ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K/A  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015   
     
   Explanatory Note to Amendment No. 1   
     
  Resonant Inc. (the  Company ) is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (this  Amendment No.1 ) to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 25, 2016 (the  Original Form 10-K ), to add the internal control over financial reporting language in the introductory portion of paragraph 4 and paragraph 4(b) of the certifications of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the  Section 302 Certifications ). This language was inadvertently omitted from the Section 302 Certifications attached to the Original Form 10-K. Because no financial statements are contained within this Amendment No. 1, paragraph 3 of the Section 302 Certifications has been omitted. The corrected Section 302 Certifications are attached to this Amendment No. l as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2.  
     
  Except as described above, no other changes have been made to the Original Form 10-K. Except as otherwise indicated herein, this Amendment No. 1 continues to speak as of the date of the Original Form 10-K, and the Company has not updated the disclosures contained therein to reflect any events that occurred subsequent to the date of the Original Form 10-K. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original Form 10-K and the Company s filings made with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-K. The filing of this Amendment No. 1 is not an admission that the Original Form 10-K, when filed, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading.
