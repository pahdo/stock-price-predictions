1.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES  

The foregoing unaudited interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and
with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America for complete financial statements. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements furnished herein include all adjustments, all of
which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented. 

The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of
the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumption are inherent in the preparation of the Company s financial statements;
accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions that could have a material
effect on the reported amounts of the Company s financial position and results of operations. 

Operating results for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December
31, 2016. 

About 3PEA International, Inc.  

3PEA International, Inc. is a vertically
integrated provider of innovative prepaid card programs and processing services for corporate, consumer and government applications.
Our payment solutions are utilized by our corporate customers as a mean to increase customer loyalty, reduce administration costs
and streamline operations. Public sector organizations can utilize our solutions to disburse public benefits or for internal payments.
We market our prepaid debit card solutions under our PaySign    brand. As we are a payment processor and debit card
program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the debit card lifecycle. We provide a card processing platform consisting
of proprietary systems and innovative software applications based on the unique needs of our programs. We have extended our processing
business capabilities through our proprietary PaySign platform. We design and process prepaid programs that run on the platform
through which our customers can define the services they wish to offer cardholders. We provide a variety of services including
transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value loading, cardholder account management, reporting, and customer service. 

We have developed prepaid card programs
for healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance, plasma donor compensation and corporate incentive and
rewards, including incentive payment solutions for the automotive industry. We plan to expand our product offering to include payroll
cards, general purpose re-loadable cards, travel cards, and expense reimbursement cards. Our cards are offered to end users through
our relationships with bank issuers. 

Our proprietary PaySign   
platform was built on modern cross-platform architecture and designed to be highly flexible, scalable and customizable. The platform
allows 3PEA to significantly expand its operational capabilities by facilitating our entry into new markets within the payments
space through its flexibility and ease of customization. The PaySign platform delivers cost benefits and revenue building opportunities
to our partners. 

 We manage all aspects of the debit card
lifecycle, from managing the card design and approval processes with partners and associations, to production, packaging, distribution,
and personalization. We also oversee inventory and security controls, renewals, lost and stolen card management and replacement.
We deploy a fully staffed, in-house customer service department which utilizes bi-lingual customer service agents, Interactive
Voice Response (IVR), SMS alerts and two SMS messaging. 

Principles of consolidation   
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated. 

Use of estimates    The preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Restricted cash    restricted
cash is a cash account controlled by the Company which funds are received related to the card programs from our customers. The
Company has recorded a corresponding customer card funding liability. 

Goodwill and intangible assets  -
Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed
for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting
unit level. A reporting unit, as defined under applicable accounting guidance, is a business segment or one level below a business
segment. We may in any given period bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a two-step method to assess and measure
impairment of the reporting unit s goodwill. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely-than-not
(i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This step
serves as the basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step
of the quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount,
including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit
is not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of
the quantitative impairment test must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s
goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit s
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

For intangible assets, we recognize an
impairment loss if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount of
the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use of the asset. 

Intangible assets with finite lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 

Revenue and expense recognition 
  We recognize revenue when (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement existing, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) our
price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability of the receivables is reasonably assured. We recognize the costs
of these revenues at the time revenue is recognized. Any fees paid up front are deferred until such time such services have been
considered rendered. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no deferred revenues recorded. 

We generate the following types of revenues: 

Administration and usage fees, charged to our prepaid card clients when our programs are created, distributed or reloaded. Such revenues are recognized when such services are performed.   

Transaction fees, paid by the applicable networks and passed through by our card issuing banks when our cards are used in a purchase or ATM transaction. Such revenues are recognized when such services are performed.   

Maintenance, administration, transaction fees, charged to a card and not under any multiple element arrangements. Such revenues are recognized when such services are performed.   

Program maintenance management fees charged to our clients. Such revenues are not under any multiple element arrangements and are recognized when such services are performed.   

Software development and consulting services to our clients. Such revenues are recognized in accordance with ASC 985-605.   

The Company records all revenues on gross
basis in accordance with ASC 605-45 since it is the primary obligor and establishes the price in the revenue arrangement. The Company
is currently under no obligation for refunding any fees or has any obligations for disputed claim settlements. 

Earnings (loss) per share  - Basic
earnings (loss) per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Basic earnings (loss) per
share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding common stocks during the applicable period. Diluted earnings
per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.

6.      LEGAL
SETTLEMENT PAYABLE  

On August 11, 2015, PSKW, LLC ( PSKW )
served the Company, with a complaint styled  PSKW, LLC v. 3Pea International, Inc. , filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. 5:15-cv-03576-RMW, San Jose Division (the  Action ). In the
Action, PSKW asserted claims against the Company for $5,800,000 for marketing fees allegedly due by the Company. The Company contended,
among other things, that PSKW breached its agreement with the Company, for which the Company was damaged in an amount in excess
of the amount which PSKW claimed was owed by the Company to PSKW. The parties each denied liability, and entered into a Settlement
Agreement and Release on October 2, 2015 whereby the Company agreed to pay $2,500,000 to PSKW in full settlement of the Action.
The settlement amount was payable by an initial payment of $1,000,000 which was paid in October 2015, with the balance of $1,500,000
being payable in equal monthly installments over 18 months with interest at 3% per annum commencing on November 1, 2015. The Court
dismissed the Action with prejudice, but retained jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement. 3Pea Technologies, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, guaranteed the amount due under the Settlement Agreement. The Company expensed the entire
$2,500,000 settlement during the year ended December 31, 2015 since the principal terms of the Settlement Agreement had been agreed
to as of that date. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the remaining unpaid balances totaling $507,704 and $1,254,658,
respectively, have been recorded as a legal settlement payable.

systems and innovative software applications based on the unique needs of our programs. We have extended our processing business
capabilities through our proprietary PaySign platform. We design and process prepaid programs that run on the platform through
which our customers can define the services they wish to offer cardholders. Through the PaySign platform, we provide a variety
of services including transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value loading, cardholder account management, reporting, and
customer service. 

The PaySign platform was built on modern
cross-platform architecture and designed to be highly flexible, scalable and customizable. The platform has allowed 3PEA to significantly
expand its operational capabilities by facilitating our entry into new markets within the payments space through its flexibility
and ease of customization. The PaySign platform delivers cost benefits and revenue building opportunities to our partners. 

We have developed prepaid card programs
for corporate and incentive rewards including, but not limited to healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance,
donor payments for source plasma and automobile dealership incentives. We are expanding our product offering to include additional
corporate incentive products, payroll cards, general purpose re-loadable cards, travel cards, and expense reimbursement cards.
Our cards are offered to end users through our relationships with bank issuers. 

We are a vertically integrated payment
processor and debit card program manager offering innovative payment solutions to corporations, government agencies, universities
and other organizations. Our payment solutions are utilized by our customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, reduce administration
costs and streamline operations. We market our prepaid debit card solutions under our PaySign brand. As we are a payment processor
and debit card program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the debit card lifecycle. These revenues can include fees
from program set-up; customization and development; data processing and report generation; card production and fulfillment; transaction
fees derived from card usage; inactivity fees; card replacement fees and program administration fees. We provide an in-house customer
service center which includes live bi-lingual phone operators staffed 24/7, for incoming calls. We also provide in house Interactive
Voice Response (IVR), SMS alerts and two way SMS messaging platforms. 

The Company divides prepaid cards into
two general categories: corporate and consumer reloadable, and non-reloadable cards. 

Reloadable Cards: These types of cards
are generally incentive, payroll or general purpose reloadable ( GPR ) cards. Payroll cards are issued to an employee
by an employer to receive the direct deposit of their payroll. GPR cards can also be issued to a consumer at a retail location
or mailed to a consumer after completing an on-line application. GPR cards can be reloaded multiple times with a consumer s
payroll, government benefit, a federal or state tax refund or through cash reload networks located at retail locations. Reloadable
cards are generally open loop cards as described below. 

Non-Reloadable Cards: These are generally
one-time use cards that are only active until the funds initially loaded to the card are spent. These types of cards are gift or
incentive cards. These cards may be open loop or closed loop. Normally these types of cards are used for purchase of goods or services
at retail locations and cannot be used to receive cash. 

These prepaid cards may be open loop, closed
loop or semi-closed loop. Open loop cards can be used to receive cash at ATM locations or purchase goods or services by PIN or
signature at retail locations. These cards can be used virtually anywhere that the network brand (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, etc.)
is accepted. Closed loop cards can only be used at a specific merchant. Semi-closed loop cards can be used at several merchants
such as a shopping mall. 

The prepaid card market is one of the fastest
growing segments of the payments industry in the U.S. This market has experienced significant growth in recent years due to consumers
and merchants embracing improved technology, greater convenience, more product choices and greater flexibility. Prepaid cards have
also proven to be an attractive alternative to traditional bank accounts for certain segments of the population, particularly those
without, or who could not qualify for, a checking or savings account. 

We have developed prepaid card programs
for healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical assistance, plasma donor remuneration, corporate and incentive rewards and
expense reimbursement cards. We plan to expand our product offering to include payroll cards, general purpose re-loadable cards
and travel cards. Our cards are offered to end users through our relationships with bank issuers. 

Our products and services are aimed at
capitalizing on the growing demand for stored value and reloadable ATM/prepaid card financial products in a variety of market niches.
Our proprietary platform is scalable and customizable, delivering cost benefits and revenue building opportunities to partners.
We manage all aspects of the debit card lifecycle, from managing the card design and approval processes with banking partners and
card associations, to production, packaging, distribution, and personalization. We also oversee inventory and security controls,
renewals, lost and stolen card management and replacement. 

Currently, we are focusing our marketing
efforts on the healthcare reimbursement market, pharmaceutical marketing or drug sampling market, source plasma donation payments
and the corporate incentive card market targeting automotive and other market niches. 

As part of our platform expansion development
process, we evaluate current and emerging technologies for applicability to our existing and future software platform. To this
end, we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components. Where appropriate,
we use third-party technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings. Third-party software
may be used for highly specialized business functions, which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints.
Our principal target markets for processing services include prepaid card issuers, retail and private-label issuers, small third-party
processors, and small and mid-size financial institutions in the United States and in emerging international markets. 

The company is devoting more extensive
resources to sales and marketing activities as we have added essential personnel to our marketing and sales department. We sell
our products directly to customers in the U.S. but may work with a small number of resellers and third parties in international
markets to identify, sell and support targeted opportunities. 

In order to expand into new markets, we
will need to invest additional funds in technology improvements, sales and marketing expenses, and regulatory compliance costs.
We are considering raising capital to enable us to diversify into new market verticals. If we do not raise new capital, we believe
that we will still be able to expand into new markets using internally generated funds, but our expansion will not be as rapid. 

Results of Operations  

Three Months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015  

Revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were $2,812,536, an increase of $778,988 compared to the same period in the prior year, when revenues were $2,033,548.
The increase in revenue is primarily due to growth of revenues associated with our plasma donor compensation programs. The company
expects revenues to continue to trend upwards in the long term. 

Cost of revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 were $1,388,590, an increase of $459,583 compared to the same period in the prior year, when cost of revenues

was within expectations. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were impacted
by expenses related to our legal settlement of October 2, 2015 which did not reoccur in the current period (Note 6), and our planned
expansion in the European Union, which decreased in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.

Liquidity and Sources of Capital   

The following table sets forth the major
sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Comparison of nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we financed our operations primarily through revenues generated from operations. 

Operating activities provided $644,423
of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $178,264 of cash in the same period in the prior year. Major
non-cash items that affected our cash flow from operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were non-cash charges of
$406,328 for depreciation and amortization. Our operating assets and liabilities used $(600,945) of cash, most of which resulted
from a decrease in our legal settlement payable of $(746,954). Major non-cash items that affected our cash flow from operations
in 2015 were non-cash charges of $219,780 for depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation of $199,805. In the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 our operating assets and liabilities resulted in $2,377,691 of changes most of which resulted
from an increase in legal settlement payable of $2,500,000. 

Investing activities used $(603,559) of
cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $(622,139) of cash used in the same period in 2015, primarily
relating to capital expenditures on continual enhancement of the processing platform used in our business. 

Financing activities used $(97,255) of
cash in 2016 as compared to $(847,964) of cash used in 2015. In 2015, cash used in financing activities consisted of payments on
notes payables totaling $847,964. 

Sources of Financing  

We believe that our available cash on hand
at September 30, 2016 of $1,333,104 and revenues anticipated for the remainder of 2016 will be sufficient to sustain our operations
for the next twelve months. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Estimates   

Our significant accounting policies are
described in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. At this time, we are not required to make any material estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. 

Any estimates we make will be based on
our experience and our interpretation of economic, political, regulatory, and other factors that affect our business prospects.
Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.

and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

company, it is not required to provide the information called for by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and
Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

by us in those reports is accumulated and communicated to the our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the evaluation date, such controls and procedures
were effective. 

Changes in internal controls  

There were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
