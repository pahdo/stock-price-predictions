     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 
     (UNAUDITED)  
 
     AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

NOTE A BUSINESS ACTIVITY  

AppSoft Technologies (the  Company )
was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada March 24, 2015.  The Company s fiscal year end is December
31 st . The Company develops, publishes and markets mobile software applications for smartphones and tablet devices ( Apps ).
We currently own a portfolio comprising over 400 Apps titles including games designed to appeal to a broad cross section of consumers
and legal-related Apps that provide compilations of federal and state laws and regulations across a variety of legal disciplines
and digests of court decisions rendered by federal courts. Consumers download our Apps through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts,
such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. 

We currently generate revenue from sales,
or downloads, of our Apps and from advertisements published on our ad supported game titles. 

NOTE B GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the
normal course of business.  As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has a deficit accumulated
of $281,431 and cash used in operations of $174,303 at September 30, 2016.  

The Company s ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing
to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.   These
circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might arise because of this uncertainty. 

NOTE C SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of Presentation- The financial statements
included herein were prepared under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). 

All adjustments have been made which in
the opinion of management are necessary for presentation. 

Interim filings should be read in conjunction
with the Company s annual report as of December 31, 2015. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents- For purposes
of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. 

Management s Use of Estimates- The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The financial statements above reflect all of the costs
of doing business. 

Revenue Recognition- The Company applies
paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition.  The Company recognizes
revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned less estimated future doubtful accounts.  The Company considers
revenue realized or realizable and earned when all the following criteria are met: 

(i) 
     persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,   
 
     (ii) 
     the services have been rendered and all required milestones achieved,  
 
     (iii) 
     the sales price is fixed or determinable, and  
 
     (iv) 
     collectability is reasonably assured.  

Comprehensive Income (Loss) - The Company
reports Comprehensive income and its components following guidance set forth by section 220-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial
statements. There were no items of comprehensive income (loss) applicable to the Company during the period covered in the financial
statements. 

APPSOFT TECHNOLOGIES  
 
     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 
     (UNAUDITED)  
 
     AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

NOTE C SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   CONT D  

Net Income per Common Share- Net loss per
common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Basic net loss
per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding
shares of common stock during each period.  There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of September 30,
2016 or December 1, 2015. 

Deferred Taxes- The Company accounts for
income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will
not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment
date. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments- The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable and payable approximate fair value based on the short-term
maturity of these instruments. 

Accounts Receivable- Accounts deemed uncollectible
are written off in the year they become uncollectible. As of September 30, 2016, the balance in Accounts Receivable was $0. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets- The Company
evaluates the recoverability of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with section 360-10-15 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification for disclosures about Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  Disclosure requires recognition of impairment
of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds its expected cash flows. If so, it is considered to
be impaired and is written down to fair value, which is determined based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values.
The Company adopted the statement on inception. No impairments of these types of assets were recognized during the period ended
September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

Stock-Based Compensation- The Company accounts
for stock-based compensation using the fair value method following the guidance set forth in section 718-10 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for disclosure about Stock-Based Compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost
of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with
limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange
for the award- the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments
for which employees do not render the requisite service. 

Fair Value for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities- The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair
value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 )
to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.  Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring
fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph
820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value
into three broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  The three levels of fair
value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: 

Level 1 
     Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  
 
     Level 2 
     Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.  
 
     Level 3 
     Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.

     (UNAUDITED)  
 
     AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

NOTE C SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONT D  

The carrying amounts of the Company s
financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity
of these instruments. The Company s note payable approximates the fair value of such instrument based upon management s
best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangement at September 30, 2016
or December 31, 2016 

The Company does not have any assets or
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value
adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value at April 30, 2015, nor gains or losses are reported in the statement
of operations that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still
held at the reporting date for the period ended September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the FASB
issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( Topic 606 ). The new guidance requires an entity
to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The new guidance supersedes the revenue
requirements in Revenue Recognition ( Topic 605 ) and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics
of the Codification. The new guidance does not apply to lease contracts within the scope of Leases ( Topic 840 ).
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which delayed the effective
date of the new guidance by one year, which will result in the new guidance being effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and is to be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted, but can
be no earlier than the original public entity effective date of fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2016. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on its financial statements, but
does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements. 

In August 2014, the
FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , that
requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability
to continue as a going concern. Until now, the requirement to perform a going concern evaluation existed only in auditing standards.
The new guidance requires management to evaluate relevant conditions, events and certain management plans that are known or reasonably
knowable as of the evaluation date when determining whether substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a
going concern exists. Management will be required to make this evaluation for both annual and interim reporting periods. The standard
states substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events,
considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become
due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The guidance is effective for annual periods ending
after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not
expect there to be a material impact from adopting this new guidance. 

In January 2015, the
FASB issued ASU 2015-01,  Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items , that
eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP. The objective of the new guidance is to simplify the income statement
presentation requirements of GAAP. Eliminating the extraordinary classification simplifies income statement presentation by altogether
removing the concept of extraordinary items from consideration. The guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim
periods within that period, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company did not experience a material impact from adopting this
new guidance. 

In February 2015,
the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation , that provides amendments to the consolidation analysis. The amendments in this
new guidance affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All
legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. The guidance is effective for annual periods,
including interim periods within that period, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company did not experience a material impact
from adopting this new guidance.

In April 2015, the
FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , as amended in August 2015 by ASU 2015-15,
 Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  that requires
that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of a debt liability,
consistent with debt discounts or premiums. The FASB will permit debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements to
be deferred and presented as an asset and subsequently amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of
whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt
issuance costs will not be affected by the new guidance. The guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for annual
periods, including interim periods within that period, beginning after December 15, 2015. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified
net debt issuance costs related to both mortgage notes payable and line-of-credit arrangements of $4,361,001 and $1,434,540,
respectively, as of September 30, 2016 and $4,091,494 and $1,375,244, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, from other assets
to mortgage notes payable, net and revolving credit facility, net on the consolidated balance sheets. 

In February 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , amending the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring
lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new standard requires
a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application,
with an option to use certain transition relief. The guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 and allows for early
adoption. The Company is assessing whether the new standard will have a material effect on its financial position or results of
operations. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) ,
that clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be classified on the statement of cash flows. This ASU addresses
eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The guidance is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company does not expect there to be a material impact from adopting this new guidance. 

NOTE D SEGMENT REPORTING  

The Company follows the guidance set forth
by section 280-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for reporting and disclosure on operating segments of the Company.
It also requires segment disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Company determined
that it did not have any separately reportable operating segments as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015

In June 2016, the Company issued the following
shares: 

80,000 shares valued at $.50
per share (total value is $40,000) as a part of the acquisition of Guuf gaming platform. Total platform purchase price was $60,000. 

1,600,000 shares were cancelled
as a part of the resignation of the Chief Operating Officer and Treasurer, Seth Ingram. The shares were originally issued at par. 

165,000 shares were issued to
3 different consultants at par for a total of $16. 

In July and August 2016, the Company issued
the following shares: 

55,000 shares were issued
to two different consultants at par for a total of $5.50. 

106,000 shares purchased at $.50
per share for a total of $53,000 in a private offering. Each security consists of one share of common stock and two common stock
purchase warrants, one of which entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share
and one of which entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share, in each case
at any time until the expiration of three years from the date of issuance. The stock purchase warrants (warrants) have been valued
using the Black Scholes Model. The  warrants  with an exercise price of $.25 have been valued at $.27 per share for
total of $28,620 and the  warrants  with an exercise price of $.50 have been valued at $.13 per share for a total of
$13,780. The total value of the warrants issued is $42,400. The Black Scholes valuation was based on the following assumptions:
a 3-year term, 40% volatility, and 3-year Treasury bill interest rate of .99%. 

Total issued and outstanding shares as
of September 30, 2016 were 3,168,500 and as of December 31, 2015 were 4,110,000 

The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000
Series A Cumulative, Convertible Preferred Shares (Preferred Stock) at $.0001 par value per share.  During the period
from inception (March 24, 2015) through September 30, 2016, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock at $.05 per
share to Ventureo, LLC in exchange for $50,000 in cash and Phone Apps with a fair market value of $50,000 for a total of $100,000.
The shares of  Preferred Stock  are convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of common stock at a conversion
price of $0.005 per share. The holder of the  Preferred Stock  may not convert any portion of the  Preferred
Stock  if, after giving effect to such conversion, the holder would beneficially own in excess of 4.99%, except that the
holder may, by written notice to the Company, increase or decrease this percentage up to a maximum of 9.99%, provided that any
such increase will not be effective until the 61 st  day after such notice is delivered to the Company. Upon a liquidation
event, the Company shall first pay to the holders of the  Preferred Stock  an amount per share equal to the Original
Issue Price (i.e., $$0.05 per share of Series A Preferred Stock), plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on each share of Series
A Preferred Stock (the  Series A Preference Amount ). After full payment of the liquidation preference amount to the
holders of the  Preferred Stock , the Company will then distribute the remaining assets to holders of common stock,
other junior preferred shares (if any) and the  Preferred Stock  on an as-if-converted-basis. 

The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior
to the Company s common stock and senior to any other shares of preferred stock the Company may issue in the future. 

Ventureo. LLC also paid $408 in expense
incurred on behalf of AppSoft, Inc. and this amount is considered an additional capital contribution.

amortization is $833.34. Accumulated Amortization as of September 30, 2016 is $12,500. 

NOTE H INCOME TAX  

The Company provides for income taxes under
(now included under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), 740), Accounting for Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires the use of an
asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are
expected to reverse. 

ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred
tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For Federal income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards
that expire through 2030. The net operating loss as of September 30, 2016, is approximately $281,000 and as of December 31, 2015
is $56,000 approximately 

No tax benefit has been reported in the
financial statements because after evaluating our own potential tax uncertainties, the Company has determined that there are no
material uncertain tax positions that have a greater than 50% likelihood of reversal if the Company were to be audited. The provision
for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to the
net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons: 

The Company is not obligated to pay
State Income Taxes because it is a Nevada corporation.

The Company issued a non-related party
Note Payable on September 11, 2015 in the amount of $2,000. This demand note bears interest at 8% per year. The Company issued

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Forward Looking Statements  

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and
related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Report, and our final prospectus for our initial public
offering filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on February 3, 2016, or the Prospectus.  

The information in this
discussion and elsewhere in this Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the  Exchange Act ). Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any
statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example,
the words  may,   will,   believe,   anticipate,   plan,   expect, 
 intend,   could,   estimate,   continue  and similar expressions or variations
identify forward-looking statements.  

Although we believe
that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Report, we caution you that these statements
are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot
be certain. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially
from the forward-looking statements contained in this Report. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not
limited to:  

Our failure to develop or acquire and publish new Apps that achieve market acceptance or we do not continue to enhance our existing Apps.    

Our inability to maintain a good relationship with the markets where our Apps are distributed.    

Our inability to keep pace with technological changes and market conditions in the Apps industry.    

Our inability to compete against a wide range of companies that market Apps, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do.    

Our ability to obtain financing as and when needed on acceptable terms.    

You should also refer
to the section of our Prospectus entitled  Risk Factors  for a discussion of important factors that may cause our actual
results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.  

We caution readers not
to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim
any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements
to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based,
or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  

Overview  

AppSoft Technologies, Inc.
( we,   us,  or the  Company ) develops, publishes and markets mobile software applications
for smartphones and tablet devices ( Apps ). Our Apps titles include games designed to appeal to a broad cross section
of consumers and legal-related Apps that provide compilations of federal and state laws and regulations across a variety of legal
disciplines and digests of court decisions rendered by federal courts that are directed to legal professionals. We offer all of
our game titles in both a free advertisement-supported version and a paid version that does not display ads. We believe that the
ad supported versions allow for wider dissemination of our titles to consumers who might not otherwise spend money for an App without
first playing the game. 

We
market, sell and distribute our games through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as Apple s App Store and the Google
Play Store. We currently or expect to advertise our Apps through the digital storefronts, our own website, social media, such as
Facebook and LinkedIn, through mobile ad networks and search engine optimization, or SEO, tools.   

We are developing and acquiring
new Apps to expand our existing product offerings. We rely on third party designers, developers and programs to develop new Apps.
We also solicit ideas for new titles from unrelated parties. We evaluate prospects based on a variety of factors. If we conclude
that a particular prospect is worth pursuing, we may fund the development of the App through launch and beyond. We expect to release
several new Apps throughout 2016. 

We
currently derive our revenue primarily from  sales, or downloads, of our Apps and from advertisements published on our ad
supported game titles. Over the course of 2016, we expect to generate revenue from  the sale
of software titles that we develop for own account or that are developed by third-parties which we acquired or that have been developed
for our benefit. Operating margins are dependent in part upon our ability to release new, commercially successful software products
and to manage effectively their development costs.   

Over the last several years,
mobile devices, including smartphone and tablets, have proliferated extensively around the world across a wide range of demographic
groups. The mobile Apps industry has experienced corresponding growth in the number of downloads, the number and types of Apps
published. We believe that there will continue to be an increase in the number of smartphones and tablets sold. In addition, technological
advances to these devices, including more powerful smartphones and tablets with larger screens provide a platform for more diverse
Apps and make games more fun and visually appealing. We believe that technological developments will continue to drive growth in
our industry for the foreseeable future. 

History  

We were organized in the
State of Nevada in March 2015. In April 2015, we concluded a transaction in which we issued 2,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred
Stock in exchange for the sum of $50,000 and the portfolio comprising over 400 Apps titles. 

On
March 31, 2016, we closed our initial public offering of common stock, which we refer to throughout this Report as our IPO. In
our IPO, we registered 1,000,000 shares of common stock for sale at a price of $0.50 per share and sold 252,500 shares of common
stock to the public for an aggregate offering price of $126,250. 

Growth Strategies and Outlook  

Our principal growth strategy
entails developing and acquiring new Apps to supplement our existing Apps portfolio. Our primary focus will be to release new game
titles. We are developing a pipeline of independent game designers, developers and programmers who provide us with new ideas and
titles to publish. We also are soliciting new games and concepts that we may acquire from third parties. We also will seek to develop
and publish free-to-play games. Free-to-play games are games that a player can download and play for free, but which allow players
to access a variety of additional content and features for a fee, through  in-app purchases  utilizing virtual currency
they may be purchased through digital storefronts, and to engage with various advertisements and offers that generate revenues
for us.  We may seek to acquire franchises around which we develop games, including movies,
television programs, toys and other cultural phenomena that lend themselves to gamification.   

Our
ability to pursue and achieve our objectives is predicated on our receipt of meaningful revenue from sales of our existing Apps
and those we may release in the future and from our ability to raise capital from outside sources.  

Our revenues will depend
significantly on growth in the mobile games market and our ability to develop or acquire and publish Apps that are well received
by consumers. In addition, because our products are purchased with disposable income, our success is dependent on the overall strength
of the economy in the United States. We expect to invest resources in research and development, analytics and marketing to introduce
new Apps and continue to update our existing Apps, and to the extent that Apps into which we have invested significant capital
are not successful, our business and financial condition could be harmed. We operate in an environment that is extremely competitive
for users against a continually increasing number of developers, many of which are significantly larger than us and have other
competitive advantages. We expect to allocate a material portion of our operating revenue and capital that we receive to sales
and marketing initiatives in connection with the launch and promotion of our games in an effort to drive sales. 

Our revenues also will
depend on maintaining our continued good relationship with the digital storefront operators, primarily Apple and Google, each of
which could unilaterally alter their terms of service in ways that could harm our business. 

Our ability to achieve
and sustain profitability will depend not only on our ability to grow our revenues, but also on our ability to manage our operating
expenses. Currently, we have one full-time employ, who receives compensation when and as determined by the board of directors.
For the foreseeable further, we expect to utilize the services of independent contractors and consultants, who we believe are readily
available for our purposes, in order to manage our personnel costs. We also will continue to maintain a virtual office as long
as our operations permit to contain our office space overhead. 

We acquired our Apps portfolio
in April 2015 and our management has operated these assets only for a very limited period of time. Thus far, we have initiated
new marketing and sales strategies with respect to our exiting titles and have seen an increase in sales of our game related Apps.
We also commenced the process of bringing up to date our legal related titles that had not been updated in several years and have
experienced increased sales and decreased returns by consumers of these titles. Management believes that it brings considerable
industry experience to the marketing of our Apps and that positive sales results, in small increments, at first, will be evident
in the near term and pick up as time progresses. Moreover, as management supplements our Apps portfolio with new games and launches
free-to-play games with multiple potential revenue streams, it expects revenues to grow rapidly. Management will seek to leverage
to our benefit its strong industry contacts built over many years across a range of Internet related sales and marketing ventures. 

We require additional capital
to fund the development of Apps in process that we have developed internally or acquired from third parties during the last two
quarters. We also require capital to fund marketing initiatives for our existing products and the launch and marketing of Apps
in development. We cannot be sure that the additional capital we require will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate
funds are not available on acceptable terms or at all, we may be unable to develop or enhance our services and products, take advantage
of future opportunities, repay debt obligations as they become due, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have
a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

General Observations Regarding Results
of Operations for the Periods Presented in this Report and Corporate Developments during the Quarter Ended September 30, 2016   

Generally, the increases
in revenues and expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable three-month period in 2015
can be attributed to the continued maturation of the Company, including: 

management s increasing familiarity and comfort level with the Company s Apps portfolio, which it acquired shortly after the Company s organization in March 2015;   

the completion of the updating of our legal titles and the corresponding increase in sales generated from those titles;   

the implementation of advertising and marketing strategies and techniques to Apps sales and their positive impact on sales of the Company s Apps; and   

the availability of proceeds from our IPO that closed in March 2016.   

Additional factors with
respect to the comparison of the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the results of
operations for the period commencing from inception (March 24, 2015) to September 30, 2015 beyond those referenced above, are that
the results of operations for the 2016 period represent a full nine months of operations whereas the results of operations for
the 2015 period represent just over three months of operations Company and the Company acquired its portfolio of Apps in April
2015. 

As a result of the foregoing
and as the Company continues to mature, management expects the Company to see increased sales of existing Apps and to commence
generating revenue from new Apps currently under development and that the Company has acquired or will acquire from third parties.
Management expects that the Company will record corresponding increases in costs and expenses attributable to the payment of compensation
to management, the retention of additional software developers and other consultants, and increased marketing costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity is the ability
of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise
operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, the availability
of credit facilities, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

As of September 30, 2016,
we had a working capital deficit of ($4,848) compared to working capital of $6,280 at December 31, 2015, comprising all cash. 

Since our inception, we
have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities and from internally generated revenue from operations. On March
31, 2016, we closed our initial public offering of securities from which we received net proceeds of $126,250. 

Our primary requirements
for liquidity and capital are to fund the development and acquisition of new Apps and for sales and marketing initiatives in connection
with the launch and promotion of our games, as well as for working capital to fund our general corporate needs, including filing
reports under the federal securities laws. We work with independent game designers, developers and programmers who provide us with
new ideas and titles to publish. We also are soliciting new games and concepts that we may acquire from third parties.  When
we receive an idea for a new App, we research the commercial viability of the concept, undertaking an analysis of the cost to develop
the App against its potential economic return. If we determine that the App is commercially viable, we may fund the cost of development,
publication and marketing. Upon completion of development we will own the App title. Developing and publishing free-to-play games
will require considerable capital to develop, maintain and update, particularly games we may seek to develop 
around popular movie, television, toy other cultural phenomena that lend themselves to gamification.   

Since our customers pay
for their purchases by credit or debit card at the time of sale, neither inventories nor receivables are relevant to our business. 

Our cash on hand and cash
flow from operations will allow us to operate at current levels but will not be sufficient to fund all of our desired development
and acquisition strategy or the cash required in connection with launching, marketing and promoting our games. We have been using
the proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock in our recently completed IPO to fund these endeavors; however, we do
not believe these funds will be sufficient for all such purposes. We will seek to fund acquisitions and to engage third party developers
partially through the issuance of securities. Therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional
financing. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities or through
other financing mechanisms. However, a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing
through the issuance of equity or debt securities and we might not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to
us, if at all. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses,
fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative
financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the
new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability
to obtain additional capital may restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations.
If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may have to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease
our operations. 

Cash Flows:  

The following table presents
summary cash flow information. 

Operating Activities    

We used net cash used in
operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of ($174,303) compared to ($13,116) for the 2015 period, in each
case consisting principally of payments to outside consultants, developers and programmers and payments to web hosting and email
hosting providers. The increase in cash used in operating activities was the result of increased corporate activity as we deployed
funds from our IPO. 

Investing Activities    

We used ($17,079) of net
cash in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to no net cash provided by investing activities
for the 2015 period. The increase in cash used in investing activities was a result of our acquisition of certain technology and
software completed during the period. 

Financing Activities    

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $186,750 compared to nil during the 2015 period. The increase
in cash provided by financing activities was attributable to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of common stock in our IPO. 

Contractual Commitments as of September
30, 2016  

As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had no contractual obligations, as such term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. 

Going Concern  

The notes to our financial
statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue
as a going concern. The presence of the going concern explanatory paragraph suggests that we may not have sufficient liquidity,
or minimum cash levels, to operate our business. Since our inception, we have incurred losses and anticipate that we will continue
to incur losses until such time as our Apps generate sufficient revenue to offset our research and development, general and administrative
and sales and marketing expenses. We received approximately $126,250 net proceeds from our IPO. We have exhausted all of these
funds principally for operational expenses in connection with the acquisition of new Apps and the retention of third party developers
to build out our Apps, among other things. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we raised an additional $53,000 of cash
in a private offering as more fully described under Part II, Item 2. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our near
term operational plans described elsewhere in this report. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our operational plans.
We cannot be sure that the additional capital we require will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are
not available on acceptable terms or at all, we may be unable to develop or enhance our services and products, take advantage of
future opportunities, repay debt obligations as they become due, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet and Other Arrangements  

We do not engage in any
activities involving variable interest entities or off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Inflation   

We do not believe that
inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become
subject to significant inflationary pressures, we might not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases.
Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
Estimates   

The discussion and analysis
of financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon the Company s financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its
estimates based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable in the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

The Company believes that
its significant accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated
financial statements.  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our audited financial statements included
in our prospectus dated February 3, 2016 for the period ended May 31, 2015. We do not believe that there has been any significant
change in the Company s critical accounting policies since May 31, 2015 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Emerging Growth Company
Critical Accounting Policy Disclosure: We qualify as an  emerging growth company  under the 2012 JOBS Act. Section
107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section
7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company, we can
delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected
to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

There are no recent accounting
pronouncements published after February 2013 that had a material effect on the financial statements presented herein. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET
RISK  

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this
item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) under the Exchange
Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time specified in the Commission s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation with the participation of the Company s management performed an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer and who we refer to herein as our PEO, of the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the quarter ended September 30,
2016. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s PEO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of September 30, 2016 due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple
levels of transaction review. 

Management is in the process
of determining how best to address this condition and implement a more effective system to insure that information required to
be disclosed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately. Our management
acknowledges the existence of this problem, and intends to developed procedures to address them to the extent possible given limitations
in financial and manpower resources. While management is working on a plan, no assurance can be made at this point that the implementation
of such controls and procedures will be completed in a timely manner or that they will be adequate once implemented. 

Changes in Internal Controls   

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

There are presently no
pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or as to which any of its property is subject, and no such proceedings
are known to the Company to be threatened or contemplated against it. 

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS  

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide the information
under this item. 

ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  

Unregistered Sales of Securities   

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we undertook a private offering of units of our securities each consisting of one share of common stock
and two common stock purchase warrants, one of which entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price
of $0.25 per share and one of which entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per
share, in each case at any time until the expiration of three years from the date of issuance. We sold an aggregate of 106,00 units
at a price of $0.50 per unit and received aggregate proceeds from the sale of the units equal to $53,000. 

The sales of the above
securities were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), in reliance
upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering and/or the private offering
safe harbor provision of Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933.

 EXHIBIT 4.3

Exhibit 4.3  

NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR THE SECURITIES
FOR WHICH THIS SECURITY IS EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION
OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE  SECURITIES
ACT ), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES
ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THIS SECURITY AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF THIS SECURITY
MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN SECURED BY SUCH SECURITIES. 

COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT  

APPSOFT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.  

THIS COMMON STOCK PURCHASE
WARRANT (the   Warrant  ) certifies that, for value received, [____________________________] or its assigns (the
  Holder  ) is entitled, upon the terms and subject to the limitations on exercise and the conditions hereinafter
set forth, at any time on or after the Issue Date and on or prior to the close of business on the three (3) year anniversary of
the Issue Date (the   Expiration Date  ) but not thereafter, to subscribe for and purchase from AppSoft Technologies,
Inc., a Nevada corporation (the   Company  ), up to [_____________] shares (as subject to adjustment hereunder,
the   Warrant Shares  ) of Common Stock. The purchase price of one share of Common Stock under this Warrant shall
be equal to the Exercise Price, as defined in Section 2(b). 

Section 1.          Definitions .
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement
(the   Purchase Agreement  ), dated ________, 2016, between the Company and the initial Holder of this Warrant. 

Section 2.          Exercise . 

(a)      Exercise
of Warrant . Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time or times
on or after the Issue Date and on or before the Expiration Date by delivery to the Company (or such other office or agency of the
Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder appearing on the books of
the Company) of a duly executed facsimile copy (or e-mail attachment) of the Notice of Exercise in the form annexed hereto and,
within five (5) Business Days (a   Business Day   being any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on
which banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized by law to close) of the date said Notice of Exercise is delivered
to the Company, payment of the aggregate Exercise Price of the shares thereby purchased by wire transfer or cashier s check
drawn on a United States bank. No ink-original Notice of Exercise shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other
type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Exercise form be required. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the
Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant
to the Company for cancellation within five (5) Business Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company.
Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder
shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable
number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased
and the date of such purchases. The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise within one (1) Business Day of
receipt of such notice.  The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of
the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares
available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.  

(b)      Exercise
Price . The exercise price per share of the Common Stock under this Warrant shall be $0.25, subject to adjustment hereunder
(the   Exercise Price  ). 

(c)      Mechanics
of Exercise . 

(i)           Delivery
of Warrant Shares Upon Exercise . As soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant in full or in part, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days thereafter, the Company at its expense (including the payment by it of any applicable issue taxes)
will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the Holder, or as such Holder (upon payment by such Holder of any applicable
transfer taxes) may direct in compliance with applicable securities laws and the Purchase Agreement, a certificate or certificates
for the number of duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled
on such exercise. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on the date the Exercise Price is received by the Company.
The Warrant Shares which are subject to an exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other
person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record thereof for all purposes, as of the
date the Warrant has been exercised by payment to the Company of the Exercise Price and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder,
if any, pursuant to Section 1(d)(iv) prior to the issuance of such shares, have been paid. 

(ii)          Delivery
of New Warrants Upon Exercise . If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder
and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant
evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall
in all other respects be identical with this Warrant. 

(iii)         No
Fractional Shares or Scrip . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise
of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the
Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction
multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share. 

(iv)         Charges,
Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or
other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of Warrant Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company,
and such Warrant Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder;  provided ,
 however , that in the event that Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant
when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the Company
may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The
Company shall pay all transfer agent fees required for processing of any Notice of Exercise and all fees to the Depository Trust
Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for electronic delivery of the Warrant
Shares. 

(v)          Closing
of Books . The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of this
Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof. 

Section 3.          Certain
Adjustments . 

(a)      Stock
Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable
in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon
exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification
of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding
immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the
aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged, subject to the limitation on fractional shares in Section 2(d)(iii).
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination
of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date
in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

2   

(b)      Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related
transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly,
effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets
in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether
by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange
their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common
Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization
or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted
into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group
acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person
or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share
purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a   Fundamental Transaction  ), then, the Holder shall
have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as
it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to
such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant (the
  Alternate Consideration  ). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall
be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect
of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate
Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration.
If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction,
then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant
following such Fundamental Transaction. At the Holder s option and request, any successor to the Company or surviving entity
in such Fundamental Transaction shall issue to the Holder a new warrant substantially in the form of this Warrant and consistent
with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder s right to purchase the Alternate Consideration for the aggregate
Exercise Price upon exercise thereof. The terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall
include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (b) and insuring
that the Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental
Transaction. 

(c)      Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

(d)      Notice
to Holder . 

(i)           Adjustment
to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall promptly
deliver to the Holder by email a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to
the number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

3   

(ii)          Notice
to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the
Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the
Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares
of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection
with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be delivered by email to the Holder
at its last email address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable
record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose
of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders
of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined
or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective
or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof
shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided
in this Warrant constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the
Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain
entitled to exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering
such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein. 

Section 4.          Transfer
of Warrant . 

(a)      Transferability .
Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws and the conditions set forth in Section 4(c) below, this Warrant and
all rights hereunder may be transferred, in whole or in part. Any such transfer shall occur upon surrender of this Warrant at the
principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment of this Warrant in the form attached
hereto duly executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any transfer taxes payable, if any, upon
the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender and, if required, such payment, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant
or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees and in the denomination or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment,
and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly
be cancelled. A Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Warrant, may be exercised
by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant issued. 

(b)      New
Warrants . This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of the
Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by
the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4(a), as to any transfer which may be involved in such
division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants
to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. 

4   

(c)      Transfer
Restrictions . If, at the time of the surrender of this Warrant in connection with any transfer of this Warrant, the transfer
of this Warrant shall not be registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and under applicable
state securities or blue sky laws, the Company may (except in case of a transfer of this Warrant to an Affiliate or a gift or contribution
for no consideration to a Family Member) require, as a condition of allowing such transfer, including for the purposes of this
Section 4(c), any sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other transfer, that the Holder or transferee of this Warrant, as
the case may be, either (i) furnish to the Company s transfer agent, a written opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be
in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions and which opinion shall be at the expense
of Company) to the effect that such transfer may be made without registration under the Securities Act and under applicable state
securities or blue sky laws or (ii) execute and deliver to the Company an investment letter in form and substance acceptable to
the Company. For purposes hereof,   Affiliate   means with respect to a Holder any Person which directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Holder and   Family
Member   means with respect to a Holder (i) any lineal descendent or sibling of such Holder, (ii) any spouse (or significant
other) of such Holder or of a lineal descendent or sibling of such Holder, (iii) any entity a majority of which is owned by any
of the persons listed in (i) or (ii) above and (iv) any trust for the benefit of the Holder or any of the persons listed in (i)
or (ii) above. 

Section 5.          Miscellaneous .

COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT  

APPSOFT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.  

THIS COMMON STOCK PURCHASE
WARRANT (the   Warrant  ) certifies that, for value received, [____________________________] or its assigns (the
  Holder  ) is entitled, upon the terms and subject to the limitations on exercise and the conditions hereinafter
set forth, at any time on or after the Issue Date and on or prior to the close of business on the three (3) year anniversary of
the Issue Date (the   Expiration Date  ) but not thereafter, to subscribe for and purchase from AppSoft Technologies,
Inc., a Nevada corporation (the   Company  ), up to [_____________] shares (as subject to adjustment hereunder,
the   Warrant Shares  ) of Common Stock. The purchase price of one share of Common Stock under this Warrant shall
be equal to the Exercise Price, as defined in Section 2(b). 

Section 1.          Definitions .
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement
(the   Purchase Agreement  ), dated __________, 2016, between the Company and the initial Holder of this Warrant. 

Section 2.          Exercise . 

(a)      Exercise
of Warrant . Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time or times
on or after the Issue Date and on or before the Expiration Date by delivery to the Company (or such other office or agency of the
Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder appearing on the books of
the Company) of a duly executed facsimile copy (or e-mail attachment) of the Notice of Exercise in the form annexed hereto and,
within five (5) Business Days (a   Business Day   being any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on
which banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized by law to close) of the date said Notice of Exercise is delivered
to the Company, payment of the aggregate Exercise Price of the shares thereby purchased by wire transfer or cashier s check
drawn on a United States bank. No ink-original Notice of Exercise shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other
type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Exercise form be required. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the
Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant
to the Company for cancellation within five (5) Business Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company.
Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder
shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable
number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased
and the date of such purchases. The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise within one (1) Business Day of
receipt of such notice.  The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of
the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares
available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.  

(b)      Exercise
Price . The exercise price per share of the Common Stock under this Warrant shall be $0.50, subject to adjustment hereunder
(the   Exercise Price  ). 

(c)      Mechanics
of Exercise . 

(i)           Delivery
of Warrant Shares Upon Exercise . As soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant in full or in part, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days thereafter, the Company at its expense (including the payment by it of any applicable issue taxes)
will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the Holder, or as such Holder (upon payment by such Holder of any applicable
transfer taxes) may direct in compliance with applicable securities laws and the Purchase Agreement, a certificate or certificates
for the number of duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled
on such exercise. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on the date the Exercise Price is received by the Company.
The Warrant Shares which are subject to an exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other
person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record thereof for all purposes, as of the
date the Warrant has been exercised by payment to the Company of the Exercise Price and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder,
if any, pursuant to Section 1(d)(iv) prior to the issuance of such shares, have been paid. 

(ii)          Delivery
of New Warrants Upon Exercise . If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder
and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant
evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall
in all other respects be identical with this Warrant. 

(iii)         No
Fractional Shares or Scrip . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise
of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the
Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction
multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share. 

(iv)         Charges,
Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or
other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of Warrant Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company,
and such Warrant Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder;  provided ,
 however , that in the event that Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant
when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the Company
may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The
Company shall pay all transfer agent fees required for processing of any Notice of Exercise and all fees to the Depository Trust
Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for electronic delivery of the Warrant
Shares. 

(v)          Closing
of Books . The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of this
Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof. 

Section 3.          Certain
Adjustments . 

(a)      Stock
Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable
in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon
exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification
of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding
immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the
aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged, subject to the limitation on fractional shares in Section 2(d)(iii).
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination
of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date
in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

2   

(b)      Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related
transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly,
effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets
in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether
by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange
their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common
Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization
or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted
into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group
acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person
or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share
purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a   Fundamental Transaction  ), then, the Holder shall
have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as
it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to
such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant (the
  Alternate Consideration  ). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall
be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect
of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate
Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration.
If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction,
then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant
following such Fundamental Transaction. At the Holder s option and request, any successor to the Company or surviving entity
in such Fundamental Transaction shall issue to the Holder a new warrant substantially in the form of this Warrant and consistent
with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder s right to purchase the Alternate Consideration for the aggregate
Exercise Price upon exercise thereof. The terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall
include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (b) and insuring
that the Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental
Transaction. 

(c)      Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

(d)      Notice
to Holder . 

(i)           Adjustment
to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall
promptly deliver to the Holder by email a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment
to the number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

3   

(ii)          Notice
to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the
Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the
Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares
of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection
with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be delivered by email to the Holder
at its last email address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable
record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose
of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders
of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined
or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective
or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their
shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof
shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided
in this Warrant constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the
Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain
entitled to exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering
such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.

principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment of this Warrant in the form attached

the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender and, if required, such payment, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant
or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees and in the denomination or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment,
and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly
be cancelled. A Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Warrant, may be exercised
by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant issued. 

(b)      New
Warrants . This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of the
Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by
the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4(a), as to any transfer which may be involved in such
division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants
to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. 

4

state securities or blue sky laws, the Company may (except in case of a transfer of this Warrant to an Affiliate or a gift or contribution
for no consideration to a Family Member) require, as a condition of allowing such transfer, including for the purposes of this
Section 4(c), any sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other transfer, that the Holder or transferee of this Warrant, as
the case may be, either (i) furnish to the Company s transfer agent, a written opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be
in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions and which opinion shall be at the expense
of Company) to the effect that such transfer may be made without registration under the Securities Act and under applicable state
securities or blue sky laws or (ii) execute and deliver to the Company an investment letter in form and substance acceptable to
the Company. For purposes hereof,   Affiliate   means with respect to a Holder any Person which directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Holder and   Family
Member   means with respect to a Holder (i) any lineal descendent or sibling of such Holder, (ii) any spouse (or significant

of the persons listed in (i) or (ii) above and (iv) any trust for the benefit of the Holder or any of the persons listed in (i)
or (ii) above. 

Section 5.          Miscellaneous .

of the Company prior to the exercise hereof in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. 

(b)      Loss,
Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably

Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of
the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant, if mutilated, the
Company will make and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant. 

(c)      Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or
granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
Business Day. 

(d)      Authorized
Shares . The Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued
Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase
rights under this Warrant.

with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.

as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies. 

(g)      Notices .
Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered
in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement. 

(h)      Limitation
of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase

for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the Company. 

5   

(i)       Remedies .
The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled
to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation
for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert
the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

(j)       Successors
and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns
of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and
shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares. 

(k)      Amendment .
This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and the Holder. 

(l)       Severability .
Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions
