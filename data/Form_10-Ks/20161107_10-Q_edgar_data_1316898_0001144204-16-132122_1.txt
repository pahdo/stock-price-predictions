  (UNAUDITED)  

1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS    

Business   

Jamba, Inc. consummated its initial public
offering in July 2005. On November 29, 2006, Jamba, Inc. consummated the merger with Jamba Juice Company whereby Jamba Juice Company,
which first began operations in 1990, became its wholly-owned subsidiary. 

Jamba, Inc. through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Jamba Juice Company, is a healthy, active lifestyle brand with a robust, expanding global business driven by a portfolio of franchised
and company-owned Jamba Juice    stores and Jamba Juice Express  formats. The Jamba    brand includes
innovative product platforms and both licensed and company driven consumer packaged goods. The Company is a leading restaurant
retailer of  better-for-you  specialty food and beverage offerings which include great tasting, whole fruit smoothies,
fresh squeezed juices and juice blends, Energy Bowls  and a variety of food items including, hot oatmeal, breakfast wraps,
Artisan Flatbreads , baked goods and snacks. Jamba Juice Company continues to expand the Jamba brand by direct selling of
consumer packaged goods ( CPG ) products, and by licensing its trademarks for CPG products sold through retail channels
such as grocery stores, warehouse clubs and convenience stores. The Company s headquarters were located in Emeryville, California
and was relocated to Frisco, Texas in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. 

As of September 27, 2016, there were 896 Jamba
Juice stores globally, consisting of 69 Company-owned and operated stores ( Company Stores ), 759 franchisee-owned
and operated stores ( Franchise Stores ) in the United States and 68 Franchise Stores in international locations ( International
Stores ). The JambaGO    business consists of approximately 2,000 licensed units located across the United States. 

2.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis of presentation and consolidation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements of Jamba, Inc. have been prepared pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for Form 10-Q. The December 29, 2015 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived
from the audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Certain information and note
disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The
results of the 13-week or 39-week periods ended September 27, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations
to be expected for the entire fiscal year. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its direct or indirect subsidiary, Jamba Juice Company. The accounts of Jamba Juice Southern
California, LLC ( JJSC ) are included through April 28, 2015, when the Company sold its 88% interest in JJSC to the
holder of JJSC s non-controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain reclassifications were made to the Company s prior financial statements to conform to current year
presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2015. 

6  

Effect of prior period misstatements   

In the Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Operations for the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 27, 2016, the Company corrected certain errors including an overstatement
of expenses included within depreciation expense of approximately $0.6 million and other income, net of approximately $0.3 million,
related to prior period financial statements. These adjustments related to both the prior quarters of 2016 and prior year 2015
results. The Company determined that the corrections were neither quantitatively or qualitatively material to those periods individually
and in the aggregate. In addition, these items are expected to have an immaterial impact on net income for the full 2016 fiscal
year. 

Use of estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Comprehensive Income   

Comprehensive income is defined as the change
in equity during a period from transactions and other events, excluding changes resulting from investments from owners and distributions
to owners. The Company currently has no components of comprehensive income other than net income, therefore no separate statement
of comprehensive income is presented. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share   

Earnings (loss) per share is computed in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 260,  Earnings Per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed
based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed
based on the weighted-average number of common shares and potentially dilutive securities, which includes preferred stock outstanding,
outstanding warrants and outstanding options and restricted stock awards granted under the Company s stock option plans. 

Anti-dilutive common stock equivalents totaling
2.1 million and 1.9 million were excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the 13-week and
39-week periods ended September 27, 2016, respectively.      Anti-dilutive common stock equivalents totaling 2.0
million and 1.9 million were excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the 13-week and 39-week
periods ended September 29, 2015, respectively. 

Fair Value Measurement   

Fair value is an exit price, representing the
amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing an asset or a liability. Refer to Note 4, Fair Value Measurement, for examples of fair values for assets and liabilities.
A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation
methodologies in measuring fair value: 

Level 1: Quoted prices are available in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Inputs are other than quoted prices in active
markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little
or no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions that market participants would use in pricing.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

The Company has not yet adopted and is currently
assessing the potential impact of the following pronouncements on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosure: 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (the  FASB ) issued amended guidance on revenue from contracts with customers which amended the existing accounting
standards for revenue recognition. Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers ,
establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that
reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective
date to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption
is permitted to the original effective date of the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods
within those periods). The amendment guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented with the option to
apply practical expedients or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases,  which will require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (with the exception
of short-term leases) at the commencement date. The guidance will be effective for the Company beginning fiscal year 2019, with
early adoption permitted. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting
period presented with various optional practical expedients. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04 ,
Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products . The new guidance creates an exception under ASC 405-20,
 Liabilities-Extinguishments of Liabilities , to derecognize financial liabilities related to certain prepaid stored-value
products using a revenue-like breakage model. The guidance will be effective for the Company beginning fiscal year 2018, with early
adoption permitted. This guidance can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment
as of the date of adoption. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The updated guidance changes how
companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures
and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective
for the Company beginning fiscal year 2017, with early application permitted. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which provides specific guidance
for certain cash flow classification issues, previously not specifically addressed, including classification for debt prepayment,
contingent consideration made after a business combination, insurance claim proceeds and corporate-owned life insurance policies,
distributions received from equity method investees and certain other items. The guidance will be effective for the Company beginning
fiscal year 2018, with early application permitted. 

The Company has not yet adopted and
does not expect the adoption of the following pronouncements to have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements
and related disclosure: 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . This update provides guidance
on management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
and to provide related disclosures. This guidance will be effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim
periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,
 Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  This update applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out ( FIFO )
or average cost method and requires measurement of that inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable
value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion,
disposal and transportation. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning fiscal year 2017, with early adoption permitted. 

8  

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,
 Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
 This update enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure. The guidance will be effective for the Company beginning fiscal year 2018. 

3.      ASSETS HELD FOR SALE   

In November 2014, the Company announced plans
to transition to an asset light model through the refranchising of Company Stores. In connection with that planned transition,
99 Company Stores and one unopened Company Store met the criteria as assets held for sale as of December 30, 2014. During fiscal
2015, an additional 125 stores met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale increasing the total to 224 stores of
which 176 stores were refranchised from assets held for sale. The 48 remaining stores were reclassified out of assets held for
sale back to their original asset group based on management s decision to retain the stores. As of September 27, 2016 and
December 29, 2015 there were no stores in assets held for sale and a zero balance was reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets. 

Gain or loss on the disposal of assets held
for sale is recorded within (loss) gain on disposal of assets in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company
recognized a loss on disposal of assets of $0.2 million and $0.5 million during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September
27, 2016, respectively. 

The Company refranchised 110 and 163 stores,
for total proceeds that include note receivables and receipts for inventory and operating fund of $36.1 million and $49.8 million
in the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 29, 2015, respectively. The Company recorded a gain of $16.2 million and $21.5
million from the disposal of assets held for sale primarily relating to refranchising during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended
September 29, 2015, respectively. 

4.      FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT   

Financial Assets and Liabilities   

The following instruments are not measured
at fair value on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets but require disclosure of their fair values: cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivables, notes receivable and accounts payable. The estimated fair value of such instruments, excluding notes receivable,
approximates their carrying value as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the short-term nature. The estimated fair
value of notes receivable approximates its carrying value due to the interest rates aligning with market rates. The fair value
of such financial instruments is determined using the income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of these instruments would be categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, with the exception of cash and
cash equivalents, which would be categorized as Level 1. 

Non-financial Assets and Liabilities   

The Company s non-financial assets and
liabilities primarily consist of long-lived assets, trademarks and other intangibles, and are reported at carrying value. They
are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when
facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Trademarks and other intangibles are evaluated
for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. 

As a result of the quarterly impairment reviews,
the Company recognized total losses of $0.4 million and $2.2 million  for the 39-week periods ended September 27,
2016 and September 29, 2015, respectively, included in impairment of long-lived assets in the Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Operations. The loss in fiscal 2016 related to the impairment of fixed assets of several operating stores. The loss in
fiscal 2015 primarily related to stores classified as assets held for sale to reflect the adjustment to fair value. 

9  

5.      CREDIT AGREEMENT   

On February 14, 2012, the Company entered into
a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association which, as amended on November 1, 2012, July 22, 2013, November 4,
2013, December 30, 2014 and December 29, 2015 (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ), made available to the Company a
revolving line of credit in the amount of $10.0 million. On July 22, 2016, the Credit Agreement expired with no amounts drawn on
the credit facility since its inception. To acquire the credit facility, the Company incurred upfront fees which were amortized
over the term of the Credit Agreement. During the term of the Credit Agreement, the unamortized commitment fee amount was not material. 

After the expiration of the Credit Agreement,
the Company subsequently collateralized the existing letters of credit with a restricted cash collateral account. Refer to Note
11, Subsequent Events, for additional information regarding the Company s credit facility. 

6.      SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION   

On May 17, 2016, at its 2016 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders, the Company s stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors, approved an additional 900,000
shares of common stock to be offered or issued under the Company s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan ( the Plan ). 

In addition to the shareholder-approved shares
mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Company periodically authorizes grants of stock-based compensation as inducement awards
to new employees. This type of award does not require shareholder approval in accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq listing
rules. 

Share-based compensation expense, which is
included in general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $0.7 million and $2.4
million for the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 27, 2016 and $1.0 million and $3.6 million for the 13-week and 39-week
periods ended September 29, 2015, respectively. At September 27, 2016, unvested share-based compensation for stock options and
restricted stock awards, net of forfeitures, totaled $4.0 million. This expense will be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of approximately two years. 

Stock Options     A summary
of stock option activity under the Plan as of September 27, 2016, and changes during the 39-week period then ended are presented
below (shares in thousands): 

During the 13-week and 39-week periods ended
September 27, 2016, options exercisable for 18,000 and 300,000 shares of the Company s common stock were granted under the
Plan at a weighted-average grant date fair value of $3.96 and $4.69, respectively. The fair value of stock options was estimated
at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 

10  

During the 13-week and 39-week periods ended
September 29, 2015, stock options of 6,500 and 962,000 were granted under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan at a weighted-average
grant date fair value of $6.51 and $6.04 per share, respectively. 

Restricted Stock     Information
regarding activities during the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016 for outstanding restricted stock units ( RSUs )
granted under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan is as follows (shares in thousands): 

During the 13-week and 39-week periods ended
September 27, 2016, RSUs of 75,000 and 549,000 were granted at a weighted-average grant date fair value of $3.32
and $3.70 per share, respectively. The grant date fair value is primarily driven by achieving the growth rate targets of the
market-based restricted stock units, included in the Chief Executive Officer s equity awards and the inducement grant awards
as discussed further in the paragraphs below. During the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 29, 2015, RSUs of 4,000 and
39,000 were granted under the Plan at a weighted-average grant date fair value of $13.71 and $15.64 per share, respectively. 

Performance Stock    
Information regarding activities during the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016 for outstanding performance stock units ( PSUs )
granted under the Plan is as follows (shares in thousands): 

No performance stock units were granted during
the 39-week periods ended September 27, 2016 and September 29, 2015. During the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016, PSUs of
2,000 were vested and PSUs of 46,200 were forfeited. During the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015, PSUs of 32,000 were vested
and PSUs of 24,000 were forfeited. 

11  

In January 2016, in connection with the hiring
of the Company s new Chief Executive Officer, the Company agreed to grant equity awards which included an award of 350,000

JAMBA, INC. OVERVIEW  

Jamba, Inc. through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Jamba Juice Company, is a healthful, active lifestyle brand with a robust global business driven by a portfolio
of franchised and company-owned Jamba Juice    stores and Jamba Juice Express  formats. The
Jamba    brand includes innovative product platforms and both licensed and company driven consumer packaged
goods ( CPG ). Jamba is a leading restaurant retailer of  better-for-you  specialty beverage and food offerings which
include great tasting, whole fruit smoothies, fresh squeezed juices and juice blends, Energy Bowls , and a variety of
food items including, hot oatmeal, breakfast wraps, sandwiches, Artisan Flatbreads , baked goods and snacks. Jamba
Juice Company continues to expand the Jamba brand by direct selling of CPG products, and by licensing its trademarks for CPG
products sold through retail channels such as grocery stores, warehouse clubs and convenience stores and focusing on the
benefits of blending. 

All references to store counts, including data
for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  

During the third quarter, we accelerated the
momentum related to the turnaround initiated earlier in the year. Operating performance during the third quarter was mixed, with
sales and net income performance below internal expectations, but ahead of industry benchmarks for top line sales. While maintaining
our focus on stellar retail performance, we also focused on critical transition efforts, including the move into our new offices
in Frisco, Texas while continuing to rebuild the leadership and support teams that were affected by the move from Emeryville, California.
This included the addition of Rachel Phillips-Luther as Chief Marketing Officer ( CMO ), previously the CMO for Zoes
Kitchen, and a number of other critical hires across the organization. In addition to the transition and relocation, we have continued
to re-assess the viability of all lines of business and subsequent to the quarter end announced our decision to exit JambaGO   .
Additionally, we announced that we will explore opportunities to refranchise our Chicago market, as a continuation of our refranchising initiative from 2014, as well as the single Company-opened
store still operating in Emeryville. Each of these decisions  are rooted
in the desire to refocus attention to the core store operating business and the continued growth of the franchise system. 

We remain focused on delivering our five key
strategies to re-energize the business: 

Build an Iconic Brand     

Establish a Customer and Store-Centric Operating Environment     

Drive Sales and Transactions through Innovation     

Improve Store Profitability through Simplification      

Expand Our Global Footprint     

14  

2016 Third Quarter Financial Summary  

Total revenue for the quarter decreased 37.9% to $22.1 million from $35.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to the reduction in the number of Company Stores as part of our refranchising strategy.   

Company Store comparable sales declined 0.8% and Franchise Store comparable sales declined 1.1%.  System-wide comparable sales (includes both Company and Franchise Stores) declined 1.1%. System-wide and Franchise Store comparable store sales are non-GAAP financial measures and represent the change in year-over-year sales, for stores opened for at least one full fiscal year.   

Net (loss) income attributable to Jamba, Inc. was $(2.0) million compared to $13.1 million for the prior year.  Non-recurring transition costs of $3.0 million are included in 2016 results. Included in the 2015 results was a $16.1 million gain on disposal of assets relating to our refranchising strategy.   

General and administrative expenses for the 13-weeks ended September 27, 2016 increased 7.7% to $9.7 million compared with $9.0 million for the prior year period.  Included in the 2016 results were $3.0 million of expenses related to the relocation of our Corporate headquarters.   

Fiscal 2016 Third Quarter Business Highlights  

During the third quarter, we focused on smoothie,
juice and bowl options featuring on-trend ingredients including our Protein Smoothies and Island Getaway Smoothies. Our local marketing
efforts in supporting both established and emerging markets focused on Jamba s heritage as a strong community partner and
our use of premium ingredients, amplifying our  Make it Real  consumer messaging. 

Island Getaway Smoothies , Gotta
Guava  Smoothie and Tropical Sunburst  Smoothie, launched late in the second quarter and sales of those items continued
to grow during the summer months. Our Protein Smoothies were developed to give guests  replenishment after workouts and as
a meal replacement, and after a successful Q2 launch in California, were launched nationally in the third quarter. Late in the
quarter we introduced our fall favorite, the Pumpkin Smash and a new line up of Almond Milk Smoothies. While these products resonated
with existing guests, traffic count results in the third quarter were below our expectations and future product innovation will
focus on incremental traffic growth. 

We will continue to provide consumers with
fresh, nutrient dense, on-trend beverages and food, at affordable prices while we refine our marketing efforts through the balance
of the year and focus on an early 2017 relaunch of the Jamba brand. Ongoing product development will focus on keeping Jamba positioned
at the intersection of fit and fun with a renewed focus on the benefits of blending. 

Driving convenience for our guests was
also a focus in the third quarter. We saw an increased adoption of the Jamba Juice mobile application ( app ),
following an update that was executed in the second quarter, which provides Jamba guests with access to regionalized menus
and the ability to customize smoothies, juices and bowls as part of their enhanced order ahead experience. Work is
underway to further enhance the capabilities of the app in accordance with our ongoing commitment to meet the continually
evolving needs of today s tech-savvy consumer. 

Additionally, we continued to expand and refine
programs with strategic partners in the digital and social media space, including Fishbowl, MomentFeed and others. Membership in
our Jamba Insider Rewards ( JIR ) program increased with more than three million loyalty members now engaged. 

With our shift to a franchise business model,
we are highly focused on improving franchisee profitability and 4-wall store margins. During the third quarter of 2016, we continued
to operationalize several key initiatives that were launched in 2015, which had a significant positive impact on costs of goods
sold. Our supply chain optimization efforts have significantly aided in offsetting the inflationary impact of commodity price increases. 

15  

Efforts to improve the profitability has allowed
our franchisees to continue to open new stores both domestically and internationally. As of September 27, 2016, there were 896
Jamba Juice    stores globally, represented by 69 Company Stores and 759 Franchise Stores, of which 47 were Jamba
Juice Express  in the United States and 68 International Stores. The system is comprised of approximately 92% U.S. Franchise
and International Store locations and 8% Company Store locations. 

Global new unit development will continue to
be a key driver in achieving our stated long term objectives. In 2016, we had international master development agreements with
partners in Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates). During the third quarter, we opened our first location in Indonesia
and anticipate that Thailand will open stores before the end of fiscal 2016 subject to an evolving political situation following
the recent death of Thailand s long reigning king. 

Support Center Relocation  

During the second quarter, we announced the
relocation of our corporate headquarters from Emeryville, California to Frisco, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. The move will be substantially
completed as we enter the fourth quarter. The stated objectives of the move are to reduce costs, provide improved access to skilled
restaurant talent and establish a more central location for our market expansion plans. We expect to incur expenses of approximately
$7.8 million as a result of the move from California, associated with personnel relocation, employee attrition, retention, severance
and replacement, office relocation and other costs. These charges are expected to be incurred from the second quarter of fiscal
year 2016 through the first quarter of 2017. As of the third quarter, we have incurred to date approximately $5.6 million in expense
and $1.1 million of capital expenditures. 

Along with the relocation, during the quarter,
we announced the appointment of Rachel Phillips-Luther as CMO. Phillips-Luther joined Jamba, Inc. from Zoes Kitchen in Dallas
where she also served as CMO. In addition, the relocation from California required us to replace a substantial number of positions
across all functions. This transition, while broad-based, allowed us to re-align our support team with the skills required to support
an asset-light, franchise business model. Hiring in the new organization is substantially complete in Development, Finance, IT
and Operations and continues in the Marketing and Supply Chain teams which are expected to be completed early in the fourth quarter. 

Other Activities  

Subsequent to the quarter, after a detailed
analysis of the performance and potential of JambaGO   , we announced that we would be managing a controlled exit
to be substantially completed by the end of 2016. JambaGO    was performing below expectations and declining across
several key metrics. As a result of our analysis, we anticipated that these numbers would continue to decline into 2017 under current
operating conditions, contributing to the decision to exit this line of the business. Revenue attributable to JambaGO   
for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016 was $0.9 million compared to $1.2 million for the 13-week period ended September
29, 2015. For the year, revenue attributable to JambaGO    for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016 was $2.2
million compared to $2.6 million for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015. We will manage a controlled exit to cease operating,
return and or de-image the equipment currently placed in the market. We are anticipating a cash charge of up to $2.2 million and
a non-cash charge, relating to impairment or accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment, of approximately $2.3 million
in 2016 related to the exit of JambaGO   . 

We announced in the fourth quarter that we
are exploring the refranchising of our company-owned operations in the Chicago area,
as a continuation of our refranchising initiative from 2014, and the Company Store in Emeryville, California. There are 13 stores for sale in the Chicago market and one store for
sale in Emeryville. We indicated that the sale of these stores if completed, would negatively impact total revenue, but positively
impact net income. The Chicago transaction would include a development agreement to grow the market over the next several years.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   13-WEEK PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER
27, 2016 AS COMPARED TO 13-WEEK PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2015 (UNAUDITED)  

  (in thousands)   

(1)   
      Cost of sales, labor, occupancy and store operating percentages are calculated using Company Stores revenue. All other line items are calculated using Total revenue.   

Revenue   

 (in thousands)  

Total revenue is comprised of revenue from
Company Stores, royalties and fees from Franchise Stores in the U.S. and from International Stores, income from JambaGO   
locations, license income from sales of Jamba-branded CPG products and direct sales of CPG products. Total revenue for the 13-week
period ended September 27, 2016 was $22.1 million, a decrease of $13.4 million, or 37.9%, compared to $35.5 million for the
13-week period ended September 29, 2015. The decrease in total revenue was primarily due to a decrease in Company Stores for the
quarter compared to the prior year. For the quarter ended September 27, 2016 we had 69 Company Stores compared to 94 in the prior
year. 

17  

Company Store revenue  

Company Store revenue for the 13-week period
ended September 27, 2016 was $14.4 million, a decrease of $13.9 million or 49.1%, compared to Company Store revenue of $28.2 million
for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2015. The decrease in Company Store revenue was due to a decrease in the number of Company
Stores primarily as a result of our refranchising activities, as well as, a decline in same store sales as illustrated by the following
table: 

Company Store comparable sales decreased $0.1
million for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016, or 0.8%, attributable to a decrease in transaction count of 1.8% and an
increase of 0.9% in average check as compared to the same period in the prior year. Company Store comparable sales represents the
change in year-over-year sales for all Company Stores opened for at least a full fiscal year. As of September 27, 2016, 97% of
our Company Stores had been open for at least one full year. 

Franchise and other revenue  

Franchise and other revenue was $7.7 million,
an increase of $0.4 million or 5.9% for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared to $7.3 million for the 13-week period
ended September 29, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increase in royalties associated with the net increase in the number
of Franchise and International Stores partially offset by Franchise Store comparable store sales decrease of 1.1%. 

The aggregate number of Franchise and International
Stores as of September 27, 2016 and September 29, 2015 was 827 and 790, respectively. 

Cost of Sales   

Cost of sales is mostly comprised of fruit,
dairy, and other products used to make smoothies and juices, paper products and delivery fees at Company Stores. As a percentage
of Company Store revenue, cost of sales increased to 24.0% for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared to 23.5% for
the 13-week period ended September 29, 2015. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of Company Store revenue was primarily
due to higher discounts (approximately 0.8%), menu mix (approximately 0.2%) and change in the store portfolio mix (approximately
0.1%), partially offset by favorable commodities (approximately 0.7%). Cost of sales for the 13-week period ended September 27,
2016 was $3.4 million, a decrease of $3.2 million, or 48.1%, compared to $6.6 million for the 13-week period ended September 29,
2015, primarily related to the lower Company Store base as a result of refranchising initiatives. 

Labor   

Labor costs are comprised of store management
salaries and bonuses, hourly team member payroll, training costs and other associated fringe benefits. As a percentage of Company
Store revenue, labor costs were 32.4% for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016 compared to 31.3% for the 13-week period
ended September 29, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to change in the store portfolio mix (approximately 2.0%) and
wage rate increases (approximately 3.0%) partially offset by favorable workers  compensation costs (approximately 2.5%) and
health and other fringe benefits (approximately 1.5%). Labor costs for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016 were $4.6 million,
a decrease of $4.2 million, or 47.5%, compared to $8.8 million for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2015, which is primarily
due to the decrease in number of Company Stores as a result of our refranchising activities. 

18  

Occupancy   

Occupancy costs include both fixed and variable
portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, property taxes, licenses and property insurance for all Company Store locations.
As a percentage of Company Store revenue, occupancy costs decreased to 13.1% for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared
to 14.1% for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2015. The decrease in occupancy costs as a percentage of Company Store revenue
was primarily due to change in store portfolio, including the closure of stores in New York and Chicago, that had higher occupancy
costs as a percent of sales for the quarter. Occupancy costs for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016 were $1.9 million,
a decrease of $2.1 million, or 52.8%, compared to $4.0 million for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2015, which is primarily
due to the decrease in number of Company Stores as a result of our refranchising activities. 

Store Operating   

Store operating expenses consist
primarily of various store-level costs such as utilities, marketing, repairs and maintenance, credit card fees and other
store operating expenses. As a percentage of Company Store revenue, total store operating expenses decreased to 16.6% for the
13-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared to 20.9% for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2015. The decrease in
total store operating expenses as a percentage of Company Store revenue was primarily due to the change in the store
portfolio mix (approximately 3.9%), lower local store marketing costs (approximately 0.7%) and utilities (approximately
0.9%). This decrease is partially offset by increased software/hardware expense (approximately 0.7%), training (approximately
0.2%) and blender  expense (approximately 0.2%). Store operating expenses for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016
were $2.4 million, a decrease of $3.5 million or 59.7%, compared to $5.9 million for the 13-week period ended September
29, 2015, primarily due to the decrease in the number of Company Stores as a result of our refranchising activities. 

Depreciation and Amortization   

Depreciation and amortization expenses
include the depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of intangible assets. As a percentage of total revenue,
depreciation and amortization increased to 4.8% for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared to 3.2% for the
13-week period ended September 29, 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue was
primarily due to the discontinuation of depreciation relating to stores in assets held for sale prior to their refranchising
in the prior year and an increase in depreciation relating to capitalized information technology corporate programs in the
current year, partially offset by a correction of an immaterial prior period adjustment which overstated depreciation expense
by approximately  $0.6 million for the 13-week period ending September 27, 2016. Depreciation and amortization for both the
13-week periods ended September 27, 2016 and 2015 was $1.1 million. 

General and Administrative   

General and administrative ( G A )
expenses include costs associated with our corporate headquarters (in Emeryville, California and Frisco, Texas), field supervision,
performance related incentives, outside and contract services, accounting and legal fees, travel and travel-related expenses, share-based
compensation and other G A expenses. Also included in G A are non-recurring costs related to the move of the support center
to Frisco, Texas, settlement, legal and other transitional charges. Total G A expenses for the 13-week period ended September
27, 2016 were $9.7 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 7.7%, compared to $9.0 million for the 13-week period ended September
29, 2015. The increase in total G A expenses results from increased payroll expenses due to severance and retention bonuses
(approximately $0.2 million) associated with the relocation of the corporate headquarters to Frisco, Texas, increased professional
fees associated with litigation and temporary help (approximately $0.7 million), and increased occupancy costs due to rent in the
Frisco, Texas office (approximately $0.2 million).  These increases were offset by a decrease in shared based compensation
expense (approximately $0.3 million). 

19  

Loss (gain) on Disposal of Assets   

Loss (gain) on disposal of assets includes
losses from disposal of assets and gains from the refranchising of Company Stores and sales of related furniture, fixtures and
equipment. For the 13-week period ended September 27, 2016, loss on disposal of assets was $0.2 million compared to a $16.1 million
gain for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2015, a change of $16.3 million. The change was primarily due to the gain on refranchising
of Company Stores in fiscal 2015 relating to our refranchising initiative. The refranchising initiative was substantially completed
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. 

Store Pre-Opening   

For the 13-week period ended September 27,
2016, store pre-opening expense was $0.2 million compared to $0.3 million for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2015, a decrease
of approximately $0.1 million due to fewer store openings in the current year. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   

For the 13-week period ended September 27,
2016, impairment of long-lived assets was $0.2 million compared to $1.9 million for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2015.
Impairment in 2015 primarily related to the loss recorded to reflect the current fair value for a group of stores classified as
assets held for sale. 

Store Lease Termination and Closure   

For the 13-week period ended September 27,
2016 and September 29, 2015, store lease termination and closure costs were $0.2 million. 

Other Operating, Net   

Other operating, net consists primarily
of income from jambacard breakage, jambacard-related fees, franchise expense, international expense, gain or loss on
investments, bad debt expense and CPG and JambaGO    activities. For the 13-week period ended September 27,
2016, other operating, net was an expense of $0.1 million compared to an expense of $0.4 million for the 13-week period ended
September 29, 2015. Changes in the components of other operating, net include a decrease in bad debt (approximately $0.2
million), a decrease in CPG and JambaGO    direct expense (approximately $0.2 million), partially offset by a
decrease in jambacard breakage income (approximately $0.1 million). The decrease in other operating, net also includes a
correction of an immaterial prior period adjustment  that overstated other operating expenses by approximately $0.3 million
for the 13-week period ending September 27, 2016. 

Income Tax Expense   

We have recorded income tax
expense for both the 13-week periods ended September 27, 2016 and September 29, 2015, respectively. Our effective income tax
rates were (0.5%) and 2.0% for the 13-week periods ended September 27, 2016 and September 29, 2015, respectively. For the 13-week
period ended September 27, 2016, the effective tax rate was primarily affected by pre-tax loss, foreign withholding and state minimum
taxes. For the 13-week period ended September 29, 2015, the effective tax rate was primarily affected by pre-tax income, a change
in the valuation allowance relating to deductible temporary differences, the alternative minimum taxes and foreign withholding
taxes.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   39-WEEK PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER
27, 2016 AS COMPARED TO 39-WEEK PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2015 (UNAUDITED)  

  (in thousands)   

(1)   
      Cost of sales, labor, occupancy and store operating percentages are calculated using Company Stores revenue. All other line items are calculated using Total revenue.   

Revenue   

 (in thousands)  

Total revenue is comprised of revenue from
Company Stores, royalties and fees from Franchise Stores in the U.S. and from International Stores, income from JambaGO   
locations, license income from sales of Jamba-branded CPG products and direct sales of CPG products. Total revenue for the 39-week
period ended September 27, 2016 was $62.4 million, a decrease of $79.8 million, or 56.1%, compared to $142.1 million for the
39-week period ended September 29, 2015. The decrease in total revenue was primarily due to a decrease in Company Stores for the
year compared to the prior year. As of September 27, 2016 we had 69 Company Stores compared to 94 in the prior year. 

21  

Company Store revenue  

Company Store revenue for the 39-week period
ended September 27, 2016 was $40.2 million, a decrease of $84.1 million or 67.7%, compared to Company Store revenue of $124.3 million
for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015. The decrease in Company Store revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number
of Company Stores primarily as a result of our refranchising activities, partially offset by an increase in Company Store comparable
sales as illustrated by the following table: 

Company Store comparable sales increased $0.6
million for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016, or 1.6%, attributable to an increase of 3.2% in average check offset by
a decrease in transaction count of 1.6% as compared to the same period in the prior year. Company Store comparable sales represents
the change in year-over-year sales for all Company Stores opened for at least a full fiscal year. As of September 27, 2016, 97%
of our Company Stores had been open for at least one full year. 

Franchise and other revenue  

Franchise and other revenue was $22.2 million,
an increase of $4.4 million or 24.4% for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016 compared to $17.8 million for the 39-week
period ended September 29, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increase in royalties associated with the net increase in
the number of Franchise and International Stores in addition to the Franchise Store comparable store sales increase of 0.2%. 

The aggregate number of Franchise and International
Stores as of September 27, 2016 and September 29, 2015 was 827 and 790, respectively. 

Cost of Sales   

Cost of sales is mostly comprised of fruit,
dairy, and other products used to make smoothies and juices, paper products and delivery fees at Company Stores. As a percentage
of Company Store revenue, cost of sales decreased to 24.2% for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared to 24.5% for
the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of Company Store revenue was primarily
due to retail price increase (approximately 0.5%), favorable commodities (approximately 0.4%) and menu mix (approximately 0.3%).
This decrease is offset by a change in the store portfolio mix (approximately 0.6%) and discounts (approximately 0.3%). Cost of
sales for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016 was $9.7 million, a decrease of $20.8 million, or 68.1%, compared to $30.5
million for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015, primarily related to the lower Company Store base as a result of refranchising
initiatives. 

Labor   

Labor costs are comprised of store management
salaries and bonuses, hourly team member payroll, training costs and other associated fringe benefits. As a percentage of Company
Store revenue, labor costs were 33.5% for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016 compared to 32.0% for the 39-week period
ended September 29, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in wage rate (approximately 2.9%) along with a
change in the store portfolio mix (approximately 1.3%), partially offset by favorable fringe benefits (approximately 1.2%) and
improved efficiencies (approximately 1.6%). Labor costs for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016 were $13.5 million, a decrease
of $26.3 million, or 66.2%, compared to $39.8 million for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015, which is primarily due to
the decrease in number of Company Stores as a result of our refranchising activities. 

22  

Occupancy   

Occupancy costs include both fixed and variable
portions of rent, common area maintenance charges, property taxes, licenses and property insurance for all Company Store locations.
As a percentage of Company Store revenue, occupancy costs increased to 14.5% for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared
to 13.6% for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015. The increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of Company Store revenue
was primarily due to the refranchising of Company Stores that carried a lower rent as a percentage of Company Store revenue. Occupancy
costs for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016 were $5.8 million, a decrease of $11.1 million, or 65.7%, compared to $16.9
million for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015, which is primarily due to the decrease in number of Company Stores as
a result of our refranchising activities. 

Store Operating   

Store operating expenses consist primarily
of various store-level costs such as utilities, marketing, repairs and maintenance, credit card fees and other store operating
expenses. As a percentage of Company Store revenue, total store operating expenses decreased to 17.5% for the 39-week period ended
September 27, 2016, compared to 17.7% for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015. The decrease in total store operating expenses
as a percentage of Company Store revenue was primarily due to lower local marketing costs (approximately 2.5%) and partially offset
by a change in the store portfolio mix (approximately 2.4%). Total store operating expenses for the 39-week period ended September
27, 2016 were $7.0 million, a decrease of $15.0 million, or 68.1%, compared to $22.0 million for the 39-week period ended
September 29, 2015, primarily due to the decrease in number of Company Stores as a result of our refranchising activities. 

Depreciation and Amortization   

Depreciation and amortization expenses
include the depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of intangible assets. As a percentage of total revenue,
depreciation and amortization increased to 6.8% for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared to 3.1% for the
39-week period ended September 29, 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue was
primarily due to the discontinuation of depreciation relating to stores in assets held for sale prior to their refranchising
in the prior year and an increase in depreciation relating to capitalized information technology corporate programs in the
current year, partially offset by a correction of an immaterial prior period adjustment which overstated depreciation expense
by approximately $0.6 million for the 39-week period ending September 27, 2016. Depreciation and amortization for the 39-week
period ended September 27, 2016 was $4.2 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2.7%, compared to $4.4 million for the
39-week period ended September 29, 2015. 

General and Administrative   

G A expenses include costs associated with
our corporate headquarters (in Emeryville, California and Frisco, Texas), field supervision, performance related incentives, outside
and contract services, accounting and legal fees, travel and travel-related expenses, share-based compensation and other G A
expenses. Also included in G A are non-recurring costs related to the move of the support center to Frisco, Texas, settlement,
legal and other transitional charges. Total G A expenses for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016 were $26.7 million,
an increase of $0.3 million, or 1.3%, compared to $26.4 million for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015. The increase in
total G A expenses was primarily due to increased professional fees associated with litigation and temporary help (approximately
$1.0 million), increased legal expenses (approximately $0.5 million), and increased occupancy costs due to additional rent in the
Frisco, Texas office (approximately $0.2 million), partially offset by a decline in share-based compensation expenses (approximately
$1.3 million). 

Loss (gain) on Disposal of Assets   

Loss (gain) on disposal of assets includes
losses from disposal of assets and gains from the refranchising of Company Stores and sales of related furniture, fixtures and
equipment. For the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016, loss on disposal of assets was $0.5 million compared to a $21.3 million
gain for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015, a change of $21.8 million. The change was primarily due to the gain on refranchising
of Company Stores in fiscal 2015 relating to our refranchising initiative. The refranchising initiative was substantially completed
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. 

23  

Store Pre-Opening   

For the 39-week period ended September 27,
2016, store pre-opening expense was $0.9 million compared to $0.5 million for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015, an increase
of $0.4 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of Franchise Stores opened this year. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   

For the 39-week period ended September 27,
2016 impairment of long-lived assets was $0.4 million compared to $2.2 million for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015.
Impairment in 2015 primarily related to the loss recorded to reflect the current fair value for a group of stores classified as
assets held for sale. 

Store Lease Termination and Closure   

For the 39-week period ended September 27,
2016 store lease termination and closure costs was $0.2 million compared to $0.3 million for the 39-week period ended September
29, 2015 due to fewer company closures in the current year. 

Other Operating, Net   

Other operating, net consists primarily
of income from jambacard breakage, jambacard-related fees, franchise related expenses and sublease income, international
expense, gain/loss on investments, bad debt expense and CPG and JambaGO    activities. For the 39-week period
ended September 27, 2016, other operating, net was $0.6 million compared to $2.4 million for the 39-week period ended
September 29, 2015. Changes in the components of other operating, net include a decrease in bad debt (approximately $1.0
million), an increase in sublease income due to an increase in subleased refranchise stores (approximately $0.4 million), a
decrease in CPG and JambaGO    direct expense (approximately $0.3 million), a decrease in franchise expenses
(approximately $0.4 million), partially offset by a decrease in jambacard breakage income (approximately $0.5 million). The
decrease in franchise expenses was primarily related to a correction of an immaterial prior period adjustment that overstated
other operating expenses by approximately $0.3 million for the 39-week period ending September 27, 2016. 

Income Tax Expense   

We have recorded
income tax expense for both the 39-week periods ended September 27, 2016 and September 29, 2015, respectively. Our effective
income tax rates were (1.0%) and 1.6% for the 39-week periods ended September 27, 2016 and September 29, 2015, respectively. For
the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016, the effective tax rate was primarily affected by pre-tax loss, foreign withholding
and state minimum taxes. For the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015, the effective tax rate was primarily affected by 
 pre-tax income, a change in the valuation allowance relating to deductible temporary differences,
the alternative minimum taxes and foreign withholding taxes.  

KEY FINANCIAL METRICS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES  

We review and discuss our operations based
on both financial and non-financial metrics. Among the key financial metrics upon which management focuses is reviewing our performance
based on our consolidated GAAP results, including Company Store comparable sales. We also use certain supplemental, non-GAAP financial
metrics in evaluating financial results, including Franchise Store comparable sales and system-wide comparable sales. 

Company Store comparable sales represents the
change in year-over-year sales for all Company Stores opened for at least one full year. Franchise Store comparable sales, a non-GAAP
financial measure, represents the change in year-over-year sales for all Franchise Stores opened for at least one full year, as
reported by franchisees and excludes International Stores. System-wide comparable store sales, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents
the change in year-over-year sales for all Company and Franchise Stores opened for at least one full year and is based on sales
by both company-owned and domestic franchise-operated stores, as reported by franchisees, which are in the store base. System-wide
comparable store sales do not include International Stores, JambaGO    units and Jamba Juice Express . Comparable
store sales exclude closed locations. 

24  

We review the increase or decrease in Company
Store comparable sales, Franchise Store comparable sales and system-wide comparable sales compared with the same period in the
prior year to assess business trends and make certain business decisions. We believe that Franchise Store comparable sales and
system-wide comparable sales data, non-GAAP financial measures, are useful in assessing the overall performance of the Jamba brand
and, ultimately, the performance of the Company. 

The following table sets forth operating data
that do not otherwise appear in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of, and for, the 13-week and 39-week periods
ended September 27, 2016 and the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 29, 2015: 

(1)   
      Percentage change in Company Store or Franchise Store comparable sales compares the sales of the specified stores during the specified period to the sales from the same set of stores for the equivalent period in the prior year. A store is included in this calculation after one full year of operations. Company Store comparable sales do not include Franchise Store sales.   

(2)   
      Percentage change in system-wide comparable sales compares the combined sales of Company and Franchise Stores during the specified period to the combined sales from the same Company and Franchise Stores for the equivalent period in the prior year. A store is included in this calculation after one full year of operations.   

The following table sets forth certain data
relating to Company Stores, Franchise and International Stores for the periods indicated: 

25  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Cash Flows Summary  

The following table summarizes our cash flows
for the 39-week periods ended September 27, 2016 and September 29, 2015 (in thousands): 

Liquidity  

As of September 27, 2016, we had cash and cash
equivalents of $14.3 million compared to $19.7 million as of December 29, 2015. As of September 27, 2016 and December 29, 2015,
we had no short term or long term debt. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operating activities. For the
39-week period ended September 27, 2016, the Company used $2.2 million in cash for operating activities. The negative cash flow
from operating activities resulted primarily from the costs the Company incurred as a result of the relocation of the corporate
headquarters. 

We expect that our cash on hand and future
cash flows provided by operating activities and our refranchising initiative will be sufficient to fund our working capital and
general corporate needs and the non-discretionary capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. During the remainder of 2016,
our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for working capital and general corporate needs, costs associated with the relocation
of the Company s corporate headquarters and cost related to the exit of JambaGO   . The use of cash to fund
discretionary capital expenditures will be based on the need to conserve our capital. 

As of the third quarter, we have incurred to
date approximately $5.6 million in expense and $1.1 million of capital expenditures related to the relocation of our corporate
headquarters. In aggregate, we expect to incur approximately $7.8 million in personnel relocation, employee attrition, retention,
severance and replacement, office relocation and other costs related to our relocation of our corporate headquarters, and approximately
$2.0 million in capital costs related to the buildout of our corporate headquarters and data center migration. 

On July 22, 2016, the credit facility with
Wells Fargo expired. Since the inception of the line of credit, we did not borrow on the facility and utilized it primarily for
collateral against letters of credit. The existing letters of credit balance of $0.4 million is collateralized by cash. 

On November 3, 2016 ,  we entered into
a credit agreement with Cadence Bank, NA ( New Credit Agreement ). The New Credit Agreement provides an aggregate principal
amount of up to $10.0 million. The credit facility also allows us to request an additional $5.0 million for an aggregate principal
amount of up to $15.0 million. The New Credit Agreement accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus 2.50%.
The New Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and has a five-year term. 

The adequacy of our available funds will depend
on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment, the operating performance of our Company Stores, the successful expansion
of our franchise and licensing programs and the successful rollout and consumer acceptance of our new beverage and food initiatives.
Given these factors, our foremost priorities for the near term continue to be preserving and generating cash sufficient to fund
our liquidity needs. 

Operating Activities  

Net cash used in operating activities was
$2.2 million for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared to $10.9 million for the 39-week period ended September
29, 2015, reflecting a net decrease in cash flows used in operating activities of $8.7 million. The decrease in cash used in operating
activities was primarily due to the changes in operating assets and liabilities (approximately $9.3 million), including an increase
in collections of receivables and changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

26  

The amount of cash provided by our operating
activities during any particular fiscal year is highly subject to variations in the seasons. The first and fourth quarters of the
fiscal year encompass the winter and holiday seasons when we traditionally generate our lowest revenue, and our second and third
quarters of the fiscal year encompass the warmer seasons where a significant portion of our revenue and cash flows are realized.
For more information on seasonality, refer to the section below entitled   Seasonality and Quarterly Results .  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities was $3.9
million for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $43.0 million
for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015. The $46.9 million change in net cash used in investing activities during the 39-week
period ended September 27, 2016 was due to a decrease in proceeds from disposal of fixed assets (approximately $46.9 million) due
to refranchising activity that occurred in fiscal year 2015. 

For the 39-week period ended September 27,
2016, cash used  for capital expenditures was $3.9 million, which includes store refreshes and redesigns and investing in improvements
to our technology infrastructure, as well as maintenance capital. Additionally, we expect to incur an additional $2 to $3 million
depending on our liquidity needs, which includes one-time outlays to complete the update of our servers as part of a broader data
migration effort and complete the buildout of the Frisco Support Center as well as capital spending in the normal course of business. 

Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by financing activities was
$0.6 million for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $24.6 million
for the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015. The $25.3 million change in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily
due to the repurchase of the shares of our common stock (approximately $26.1 million) under the stock repurchase plan approved
by our Board of Directors in 2014 that occurred during the 39-week period ended September 29, 2015, partially offset by a decrease
in receipts from our stock issuance plans, including from the exercise of stock options (approximately $0.9 million). 

Contractual Obligations  

There have been no significant changes to our
contractual obligations table as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2015. 

COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS  

We contract for significant amounts of individually
quick frozen fruit, fruit concentrate and dairy products to support the needs of both our Company Stores and Franchise Stores.
The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future
results of operations. 

SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS  

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
We expect to realize significant portions of our revenue during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year, which align with
the warmer summer season. In addition, quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and weather conditions.
However, geographic diversification of our store locations may conceal or diminish the financial statement impact of such seasonal
influences. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be achieved for the full fiscal year or any subsequent quarter. 

27  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to adopt accounting
policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In
many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a process to review the
application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that we are required to make in
order to prepare the financial statements. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment
based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. There have been no significant changes to the
policies and estimates as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2015. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

See Recent Accounting Pronouncements section
of Note 2 to our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about new accounting standards. 

28  

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK  

Interest Rates  

We do not enter into market risk sensitive
instruments for trading purposes. We are exposed to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest rates in our interest
bearing accounts. We do not believe a change in interest rates will materially affect our financial position or results of operations.
As of December 29, 2015 a one percent change of the interest rate would result in an annual change in the results of operations
of approximately $0.2 million. 

Commodities Prices  

We are exposed to the impact of commodity and
utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various market conditions over which we do not
have control. We purchase significant amounts of produce and dairy products to support the needs of our Company Stores. The price
and availability of these commodities directly impact the results of operations and can be expected to impact the future results
of operations. 

We purchase fruit based on short-term seasonal
pricing agreements. These short-term agreements generally set the price of procured frozen fruit and 100% pure fruit concentrates
for less than one year based on estimated annual requirements. We purchase fresh produce based on annual pricing agreements. In
order to mitigate the effects of price changes in any one commodity on our cost structure, we contract with multiple suppliers
both domestically and internationally. These agreements typically set the price for some or all of our estimated annual fruit and
fresh produce requirements, protecting us from short-term volatility. Nevertheless, these agreements typically contain a  force
majeure  clause, which, if utilized (such as hurricanes in 2004 that destroyed the Florida orange crop and the 2007 freeze that
affected California citrus), may subject us to significant price increases. 

Our pricing philosophy is not to attempt to
change consumer prices with every move up or down of the commodity market, but to take a longer term view of managing margins and
the value perception of our products in the eyes of our customers. Our objective is to maximize our revenue through increased customer
traffic. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We have established and maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and our subsidiaries required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was necessarily required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We carried out an evaluation under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 27, 2016. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934) during the fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

29  

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

We are party to various legal proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of our business. Based on the information currently available, the Company is not currently a party to any
legal proceeding that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results
of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Our risk factors are included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2015 and have not materially changed except for the following
additional risk factor: 

The relocation of our corporate headquarters and data center
could adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition, as we may experience disruptions to our business
and incur additional costs in connection with the relocation.   

We announced on May 4, 2016, the relocation
of our corporate headquarters and data center from Emeryville, California to Frisco, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. The process
of moving our headquarters is inherently complex and not part of our day-to-day operations, and includes the relocation of our
data center, which contains a significant portion of our core business information and applications. The relocation process
could cause significant disruption to our operations and cause the temporary diversion of management resources, all of which could
have a material adverse effect on our operations, operating results and financial condition. The need to replace Company personnel
who do not relocate, train new employees and transition Company operating knowledge may cause disruptions in our business. 
While we have implemented a transition plan to provide for the move of our corporate operations and data center, including relocation
benefits for employees who may be transferring, and severance and retention benefits for employees who will not be continuing with
the Company after the move, we may encounter difficulties retaining employees who elect to transfer and attracting new talent in
the Dallas area to replace our employees who are unwilling to relocate, and we may also experience difficulties in retaining employees
who will remain in Emeryville, California during the transition period and who we are relying on to facilitate the transition of
the Company operating knowledge. In addition, we may incur additional costs for duplication in staff as we effect the transition. Furthermore,
we may experience disruption in accessibility to our data as we migrate our data center, and any disruption could have a material
adverse effect on our operations, operating knowledge and financial condition. Even though we are taking the necessary precautions,
we can give no assurance that the relocation will be completed as planned or within the expected timeframe. In addition, the relocation
may involve significant additional costs to us and the expected benefits of the move may not be fully realized due to associated
disruption to our operations and personnel.

of Proceeds  

None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities  

None.

 EXHIBIT 10.1

Exhibit 10.1  

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT  

This Transition Services
Agreement (this  Agreement ) is made and entered into between the undersigned (referred to  herein 
as  Executive ) and Jamba Juice Company, a California corporation (the  Company ), pursuant to the Executive
Retention and Severance Plan adopted by Jamba, Inc. effective July 25, 2013 (the  Plan ). 

1.           Separation. 
Executive s last day of work with the Company is anticipated to be March 20, 2017   (the actual termination date, 
 the  Separation Date ), on which date the Company intends to terminate Executive without Cause (as such term is
defined in the Plan). 

2.           Accrued
Salary and Vacation.  On the Separation Date, the Company will pay Executive all salary and unused vacation through the Separation
Date, subject to standard payroll deductions and withholdings. Executive is entitled to these payments regardless of whether you
sign this Agreement. 

3.           Consideration.
 In consideration for signing this release and an additional, substantially identical release setting forth the terms contained
in Sections 5, 6 and 7 of this Agreement, no earlier than the Separation Date and no later than 60 days after the Separation Date,
and provided that Executive does not revoke either release and complies with the other provisions as required by the Plan for receipt
of Severance Benefits (as defined in the Plan), the Company will provide Executive with the Severance Benefits provided pursuant
to Section 4.1 of the Plan. If Executive continues to work on a full-time basis and be employed by the Company through December
15, 2016, in lieu of the payment schedule set forth in the Plan, One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars of the Severance Benefits
will be paid to Executive on December 15, 2016, subject to standard payroll deductions and withholdings, with the balance of the
Severance Benefits paid to Executive as salary continuation in approximate equal payments over twelve (12) months in accordance
with the Company s bi-weekly payroll schedule, beginning on the first payroll date after the Separation Date, subject to
standard payroll deductions and withholdings. 

(a)           Additional
Consideration.  For purposes of providing the Company an orderly transition, in addition to the Severance Benefits provided
pursuant to Section 4.1 of the Plan, the Company will provide the following additional consideration if Executive continues to
work on a full-time basis and be employed by Company through March 20, 2017 or such earlier Separation Date that the Company may
otherwise determine and provide notice of same to Executive. If the Company determines an earlier Separation Date than March 20,
2017 other than due to a termination for Cause (as defined in the Plan), Executive shall nonetheless be paid salary through March
20, 2017, subject to standard payroll deductions and withholdings. If Executive resigns her employment or is terminated for Cause,
death, or Disability prior to March 20, 2017 (or such earlier date as mutually determined with the Company), then, notwithstanding
the release of claims being signed by Executive herein, Executive shall not be paid salary through March 20, 2017 but only through
such last date of employment and shall not be eligible for the following additional consideration set forth today. 

1  

(1)          Accelerated
Vesting of Equity Awards    

(i)          Options. 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any plan or agreement evidencing an Option held by Executive, the vesting
and exercisability of each such Option shall be accelerated by twelve (12) months upon the Separation Date, subject to Board approval. 

(ii)         Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any plan or agreement evidencing
Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units held by Executive, vesting of such Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall
be accelerated by twelve (12) months upon the Separation Date. 

(iii)        Time-Based
Portion of Performance Based Awards.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any plan or agreement evidencing
performance based awards, if Executive is eligible to receive a performance based award on the Separation Date, vesting of such
performance based award shall be accelerated by twelve (12) months upon the Separation Date, such that Executive shall be deemed
to have completed an additional twelve (12) months of service to the Company to be eligible for achieve any time based portion
of a performance based award, subject to the actual attainment of the performance metrics thereof. 

(iv)        Other
Performance Awards.  Except as set forth above, the treatment of stock-based compensation upon the consummation of a Change
in Control shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the plans or agreements providing for such awards. In addition,
any award of Options, Restricted Stock, or Restricted Stock Units, the value or vesting of which is determined based on attainment
of performance metrics, such awards shall be governed by the terms of the award and not Section 5 of the Plan. Performance
based awards are not affected by the accelerated vesting in clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 3(a)(1) above except to the extent of
the deemed services for purposes of the time-based portion thereof. Performance metrics for determination of achievement of performance
based awards measured based upon a future date shall instead be measured as of the Separation Date. Executive will be eligible
to receive the 2016 Target Bonus if earned without any deduction based on Executive s Separation. 

(2)         Health
Insurance   

(i)            To
the extent provided by the federal COBRA law or, if applicable, state insurance laws, and by the Company s current group
health insurance policies, Executive will be eligible to continue her group health insurance benefits at her own expense. For a
period of twelve (12) months, the Company will continue to pay the employer portion of Executive group health insurance premiums
and Executive will only be responsible for the employee portion of that monthly premium, provided Executive do not become eligible
for health coverage from another employer during this period. After twelve (12) months, Executive will be responsible for paying
the entire premium to maintain coverage. Later, Executive may be able to convert to an individual policy through the provider of
the Company s health insurance, if Executive wishes. Executive will be provided with a separate notice of your COBRA rights. 

2  

(3)         No
Duty to Mitigate.  Notwithstanding Section 16.2 of the Plan, Executive has no obligation to mitigate and any amounts payable
under the Plan and/or this Agreement will not be reduced by any amounts earned by Executive from other employment or business activities
during the Severance Benefit Period. 

(b)            Retention
Bonus.   

(i)           So
long as Executive continues her employment with Company and executes her duties through July 15, 2016, Executive will be eligible
to receive a Retention Bonus in an amount of $75,000. 

(ii)          In
the event the Company ends Executive s employment prior to July 15, 2016 for any reason other than Cause, it will nevertheless
pay Executive 100% of the Retention Bonus that would have been payable to Executive under this Agreement had the Company not ended
your employment prior to July 15, 2016 . 

(iii)         The
Company will pay the Retention Bonus Payment promptly on July 15, 2016. The Retention Bonus shall be subject to all withholdings
required by law. 

4.           Other
Compensation or Benefits.  Executive acknowledges that, except as expressly provided in Paragraph 3 of this Agreement, Executive
will not receive any additional compensation, severance or benefits after the Separation Date.
