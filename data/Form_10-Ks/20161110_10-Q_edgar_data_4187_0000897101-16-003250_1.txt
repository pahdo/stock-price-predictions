    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
  (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1           SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL  
      
  During 2015, the Company's average selling price per unit of quantity decreased by      49.4 % and      24.9 % for ferrous and nonferrous material, respectively, compared to 2014.     Due to these deteriorating metals commodity market conditions, ISA took significant steps to improve liquidity and pay down debt during 2015 and early 2016.   Despite improvements in metal commodity markets during 2016, low prices combined with low volumes present a difficult ongoing metals recycling market.  
   
  In connection with the previously disclosed ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives, on September 30, 2016, the Company and Algar, Inc. ("Algar") mutually agreed to terminate the Management Services Agreement between them dated as of December 1, 2013 (the "Management Agreement"), pursuant to the Agreement to Terminate Management Services among the Company, Algar, and Sean Garber dated as of September 30, 2016 (the "Termination Agreement").  See  Note 6 - Related Party Transactions for further details.   
   
    Effective September 30, 2016, Mr. Garber resigned from all positions with the Company, including as President, and the Board appointed Todd Phillips as President.  Mr. Phillips has been the Company's CFO since December 31, 2014 and will continue to serve in that role.    
   
   The Company's Response to 2015 Commodity Markets and Liquidity Conditions:    
     
  The Company took the below steps to address the challenging metal commodity market.  
   
  On February 27, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its Seymour, Indiana property.     Also, in conjunction with this decision, the Company signed a lease, effective December 1, 2014, to lease a facility in the Seymour area.        See Note 4 - Lease Commitments for further lease information and Note 6 - Related Party Transactions for further related party details.     Proceeds were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.  
     
  On April 30, 2015, LK Property Investments, LLC ("LK Property"), an entity principally owned by Daniel M. Rifkin, CEO of MetalX LLC ("MetalX"), (a related party) a scrap metal recycling company headquartered in Waterloo, Indiana, and the principal owner of Recycling Capital Partners, LLC ("RCP") (a related party) purchased a      4.4      acre parcel of real estate located at 6709 Grade Lane, Louisville, KY from ISA Real Estate, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for a purchase price of     $ 1.0  million. The Company realized a loss of     $ 102.0  thousand     from this sale. Also on April 30, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement with LK Property for a portion of the     4.4     acre parcel.     See Note 4 - Lease Commitments for further lease details and Note  6  - Related Party Transactions. Proceeds were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.  
     
  On May 13, 2015, the Company announced the warm idle of the Company s auto shredder. This action was in response to market conditions, primarily related to ferrous price volatility and lower ferrous volumes.     Management will continue to monitor and analyze market conditions and to review the Company s long-term options for its shredder and related downstream processing operation. The costs of idling were recognized in the second quarter of 2015 financial statements. As a result of the continued operating losses from the shredder operations, management reviewed the carrying cost of the shredder, including the downstream processing system. The Company recognized an asset impairment charge during the first quarter of 2015 of approximately     $636.6 thousand     related to the shredder s downstream processing system. This charge was recorded as an impairment charge on property and equipment within the cost of goods section in the September 30, 2015 condensed consolidated statement of operations.     As of the date of this report, the shredder remains idled.     The Company continues to depreciate the assets associated with the shredder.     Working capital, which would otherwise have been utilized in operating the shredder, was used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.  
     
  In May   2015,     ISA Real Estate, LLC sold to SG D Ventures, LLC ("SG D"), an entity owned by shareholders of Algar, Inc. ("Algar"), including Sean Garber, at that time the Company s Vice Chairman of the Board and President, and the President of Algar, an approximately      1 -acre parcel of non-essential real estate, located at 7017 Grade Lane, Louisville, KY, for an aggregate purchase price equal to independent third-party appraisal amount of     $ 350.0  thousand.        The purchase consideration consisted of     $ 300.0  thousand     in cash from the purchaser and a credit of     $ 50.0  thousand     against bonus compensation previously accrued but not paid to Algar as described in Note 6 - Related Party Transactions.    T  he gain on sale of this asset was     $ 1.1  thousand and was recognized during the second quarter of 2015. Proceeds were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.  
     
  On November 6, 2015, the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement and Third Amendment to Credit Agreement (the      Forbearance Agreement ) by and among the Company, certain of the Company s subsidiaries, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo").     The Forbearance Agreement amended the Credit Agreement to reduce the Maximum Revolver Amount from     $ 15.0  million to     $ 5.0  million. The Forbearance Agreement also amended the Credit Agreement Maturity Date to March 15, 2016 from June 13, 2019. The Forbearance Agreement increased the interest rate on the outstanding indebtedness by approximately     100 basis points.  

NOTE  1            SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL, Continued  

Pursuant to the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, Wells Fargo agreed that it would forbear, until the Forbearance Termination Date (as defined below), from exercising certain rights and remedies with respect to or arising out of the existence and continuation of certain stipulated events of default under the Credit Agreement between the loan parties and Wells Fargo (as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated January 15, 2015, the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement dated January 22, 2015, and the Forbearance Agreement, the      Credit Agreement ).  
     
  Under the Forbearance Agreement, the Forbearance Termination Date was the earlier to occur of (i) Wells Fargo s election following the failure of the Loan Parties to satisfy any of the Forbearance Conditions, and (ii) March 15, 2016.  See Note  3  - Long Term Debt and Notes Payable to Bank for further details.      
     
  On December 4, 2015, the Company and WESSCO, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of ISA ("WESSCO"), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with Compactor Rentals of America, LLC ("Compactor Rentals") pursuant to which the Company sold its      Waste Services Segment,      consisting of substantially all of the assets used in (i) the Company s commercial, retail and industrial waste and recycling management services business which the Company operated under the name      Computerized Waste Systems      or      CWS,      and (ii) the Company s equipment sales, rental and maintenance business for the commercial and industrial waste and recycling industry which the Company operated under the name      Waste Equipment Sales and Service Company".  
     
  The Company received cash consideration at closing of     $7.5 million, less     $ 150.0  thousand retained by Compactor Rentals (the "Holdback"). Compactor Rentals assumed certain liabilities relating to the Waste Services Segment, including but not limited to, current liabilities, warranty liabilities, and post-closing liabilities incurred in connection with transferred contracts.  
     
  The sale included substantially all of the assets of the Waste Services Segment including, but not limited to, current assets, accounts receivable, tangible personal property, certain leases, inventory, intellectual property, rights under transferred contracts, rights of action and all associated goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the transferred assets.  
     
  The Asset Purchase Agreement contains a restrictive covenant under which the Company is prohibited from competing with the Waste Services Segment for      five  years following the closing.  
     
  In connection with the closing of the transaction, the Company entered into a transition services agreement with Compactor Rentals, pursuant to which the Company will provide certain services to Compactor Rentals until March 31, 2017.  
     
  See Note 10 - Discontinued Operations for further details related to the sale of the Waste Services Segment.     
   
  The Company used the proceeds from the transaction to pay transaction expenses, to repay in full the Company s outstanding indebtedness with Bank of Kentucky, Inc., ("KY Bank") and to repay in full ISA s term loan from Wells Fargo.        The Company also used the proceeds to pay all outstanding amounts on ISA s     $ 5.0  million revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo which remained available following the closing.  
   
  On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement (the "2016 Loan") with MidCap Business Credit, LLC ("MidCap").     The 2016 Loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.     Proceeds from this loan were used to pay transaction expenses and to pay off and close the remaining balance on the Wells Fargo revolving line of credit.     See Note  3  - Long Term Debt and Notes Payable to Bank for further details.     

Liquidity    
   
  The Company's sources of liquidity from 2014 to present have primarily consisted of proceeds from asset and equity sales as well as the idling of the auto shredder and refinancing of its working capital line of credit.  Influenced primarily by the length and depth of the metals market downturn and the Company's ongoing operating losses, the Company may not be able to fund future capital needs, including necessary working capital, funds for capital expenditures or debt service, from operating cash flow.  Consequently, the Company may have to rely on third-party sources to fund capital needs or may have to rely on further asset sales or similar actions. The Company may be unable to obtain third-party financing or conduct asset sales on favorable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.  Furthermore, the Company cannot provide assurance that sufficient liquidity can be raised from one or more of these sources or that a desired transaction could be consummated within the period needed to meet certain obligations.  

NOTE 1           SUMMARY OF     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL, Continued  

Basis of Presentation  
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements.     The Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") as produced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") is the sole source of authoritative GAAP.     The information furnished includes all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly our financial position as of   September     30, 2016 and the results of our operations and changes in our cash flows for the periods ended    September      30, 2016 and     2015. Results of operations for the period ended    September      30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. Additional information, including the audited     December     31, 2015 consolidated financial statements and the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended     December     31, 2015, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Estimates  
   
  In preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, management must make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as affecting the disclosures provided. Examples of estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, estimates of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, estimates of inventory balances, and estimates of stock option and warrant values. The Company also uses estimates when assessing fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in business acquisitions as well as any fair value and any related impairment charges related to the carrying value of inventory and machinery and equipment and other long-lived assets. Despite the Company s intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from these estimates.  

Principles of Consolidation  
   
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.     Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts, transactions and profits have been eliminated.  

Reclassifications  
   
  The Company has reclassified certain items within the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the prior year in order to be comparable with the current presentation.     These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported income (loss) or shareholders' equity.  

Discontinued Operations  
     
  Prior year financial statements have been recast to reflect the sale of the Company s Waste Services Segment assets in the fourth quarter of 2015 in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 205-20-55 within discontinued operations. Results of discontinued operations are excluded from the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted. See Note 10 - Discontinued Operations.  

Fair Value  
     
  The Company carries certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. These financial assets and liabilities are composed of cash and cash equivalents and derivative instruments. Long-term debt is carried at cost, and the fair value is disclosed herein.     In addition, the Company measures certain assets, such as long-lived assets, at fair value on a non-recurring basis to evaluate those assets for potential impairment. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  
     
  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company categorizes its financial assets and liabilities into the following fair value hierarchy:  
     
  Level 1           Financial assets and liabilities with values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. Examples of Level 1 financial instruments include active exchange-traded securities.  
     
  Level 2           Financial assets and liabilities with values based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Examples of Level 2 financial instruments include various types of interest-rate and commodity-based derivative instruments, and various types of fixed-income investment securities. Pricing models are utilized to estimate fair value for certain financial assets and liabilities categorized in Level 2.  

NOTE  1            SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL, Continued  

Level 3           Financial assets and liabilities with values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable in the market and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management s judgment about the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are based on the best available information, some of which is internally developed.     
     
  When determining the fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, ISA looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities. When identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. Nevertheless, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets, and uses alternative valuation techniques to derive fair value measurements.  
     
  The Company uses the fair value methodology outlined in the related accounting standards to value the assets and liabilities for cash, debt and derivatives. All of our cash is defined as Level  1  and all our debt and derivative contracts are defined as Level 2.  

In accordance with this guidance, the following table represents our fair value hierarchy for Level 1 and Level 2 financial instruments at    September      30, 2016 (in thousands):   

The Company had no transfers in or out of Levels 1 or 2 fair value measurements, and no activity in Level 3 (except impairment of property and equipment) fair value measurements for the   nine   month periods ended    September      30, 2016 or     2015.     

Common Stock and Share-based Compensation Arrangements     
     
  The Company has a Long Term Incentive Plan adopted in 2009 ("LTIP") under which it may grant equity awards for up to      2.4  million shares of common stock, which are reserved by the Board of Directors for issuance of equity awards.     The Company provides compensation benefits by granting stock options and other share-based awards to employees and directors.     The exercise price of each option is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant.     The maximum term of the option is      five  years. The plan is accounted for based on FASB s authoritative guidance titled "ASC 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation.  "    The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for the fair value of the awards, on the date granted, on a straight-line basis over their vesting term.     Compensation expense is recognized only for share-based payments expected to vest. The Company estimates forfeitures at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations.     
     
  The Company uses the grant date stock price to value the Company's restricted stock units.  The fair value of each restricted stock unit is estimated on the date of grant.  
   
  The Company uses the Modified Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to value the Company's stock options for each employee stock option award.   See Note 7 - Share Based Compensation. Using these option pricing models, the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant.   
     
  There are two significant inputs into the stock option pricing models: expected volatility and expected term.     The Company estimates expected volatility based on volatility of the Company's stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted. The expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the Company's stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option grants are expected to be outstanding.  

NOTE  1            SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL, Continued  

The expected term assumption incorporates the contractual term of an option grant, as well as the vesting period of an award. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury constant maturity with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option granted.     The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate, and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current period.  
     
  Treasury shares or new shares are issued for exercised options. The Company does not expect to repurchase any additional shares within the following annual period to accommodate the exercise of outstanding stock options.  
     
  Under the LTIP, the Company may grant any of these types of awards: non-qualified and incentive stock options; stock appreciation rights; and other stock awards including stock units, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and restricted stock. The performance goals that the Company may use for such awards will be based on any one or more of the following performance measures: cash flow; earnings; earnings per share; market value added or economic value added; profits; return on assets; return on equity; return on investment; revenues; stock price; or total shareholder return.  
     
  The LTIP is administered by a committee selected by the Board consisting of two or more outside members of the Board. The Committee may grant one or more awards to our employees, including our officers, our directors and consultants, and will determine the specific employees who will receive awards under the plan and the type and amount of any such awards. A participant who receives shares of stock awarded under the plan must hold those shares for      six  months before the participant may dispose of such shares.  
     
  S ubject to shareholder approval and restrictions on exercisability set forth in a Stock Option Agreement entered into on December 2, 2013 between the Company and Algar (the        Stock Option Agreement ), the Company granted Algar an option to purchase a total of      1.5  million shares (in      four  tranches) of Company common stock (the "Algar Options") at an exercise price per share of     $ 5.00 .     The Algar Options were not issued under the LTIP.       The Company's shareholders approved the Algar Options on October 15, 2014.  On  September 30, 2016, the Company and Algar mutually agreed to terminate the Management Agreement between them dated as of December 1, 2013.  As part of the agreement to terminate the Management Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement was also terminated.  See     Note 6 - Related Party Transactions for further details .   
   
   The Company used the Lattice-Based model to value the Company's stock options for the Algar Options due to market and performance conditions prior to September 30, 2016.    See Note 7 - Share Based Compensation. The fair value of the Algar Options was estimated at the end of each quarter for      two  of the tranches due to ongoing performance conditions.     For the first     two tranches, the performance conditions were met.    
   
      Other Income      
   
    In the third quarter of 2016, the Company received insurance proceeds in the amount of $ 571.4  thousand related to an insurance claim made for  six  roofs on certain of the Company's buildings due to weather related damage.  The Company recognized a gain of $ 233.3  thousand, net of $ 80.0  thousand of impairment write-downs of the related roofs, consulting fees related to the claim, and amounts set aside in accrual for repairs on leased properties.    

Subsequent Events  
   
  The Company has evaluated the period from     September 30, 2016 through the date the financial statements herein were issued and noted no subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements . 

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards     
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,     Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   The amendments in ASU 2014-09 affect any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.        The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company has not yet assessed the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  

NOTE  1            SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL, Continued  

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.   2014-15 ,   Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) . The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
   
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,     Interest-Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . The guidance requires an entity to present debt issuance costs     in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, rather than as an asset. Amortization of debt issuance costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. Debt issuance costs related to revolving credit arrangements, however, will continue to be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the arrangement.     ASU 2015-03 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 including interim periods within those annual periods.  Upon adoption, ASU 2015-03 should be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016 and presented debt issuance costs related to a revolving credit arrangement as an asset which will amortize ratably over the term of the arrangement.   
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,     Inventory  , which simplifies the measurement principle of inventories valued under the First-In, First-Out ("FIFO") or weighted average methods from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,     Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Upon adoption, ASU 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,     Leases  , to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease assets ( lessees ) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee s right to use, or control use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU simplify the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. This ASU leaves the accounting for the organizations that own the assets leased to the lessee ( lessor ) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  
   
  The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
   
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   , which provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Upon adoption, ASU 2016-15 should be applied retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   

NOTE 2           INVENTORIES  

The Company's inventories primarily consist of ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metals, and are valued at the lower of average purchased cost or market based on the specific scrap commodity. Quantities of inventories are determined based on our inventory systems and are subject to periodic physical verification using estimation techniques including observation, weighing and other industry methods. The Company recognizes inventory impairment and related adjustments when the market value, based upon current market pricing, falls below recorded value or when the estimated volume is less than the recorded volume of the inventory. The Company records the loss in cost of sales in the period during which the loss is identified.  

Management spent much of 2014 and early 2015 working to assess the Company's automobile shredder residue ("ASR") process.     Significant process and strategy changes associated with the ASR process were made.     These changes, combined with the significant metals market reduction in market demand and prices experienced in late 2014 and through 2015, caused management to perform a lower of cost-or-market assessment, which resulted in inventory write-downs during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in the amount of     $ 1.1  million charged to cost of sales as a result of impairment associated primarily with ferrous market price decreases.     The Company did not have a lower of cost-or-market inventory write-down in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  Some commodities are in saleable condition at acquisition. The Company purchases these commodities in small amounts until it has a truckload of material available for shipment. Some commodities are not in saleable condition at acquisition. These commodities must be shredded, torched or baled. ISA does not have work-in-process inventory that needs to be manufactured to become finished goods. The Company includes processing costs in inventory for all commodities by weight.  

Inventories as of   September     30, 2016 and     December     31, 2015 consist of the following:  

NOTE 3           LONG TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE TO BANK  
     
  Summary:  
     
  During 2014, the Company had certain loans with Wells Fargo and certain loans with KY Bank.     As of December 31, 2014, the Company was in default under the Wells Fargo loans and during the second half of 2015 entered into a Forbearance Agreement with Wells Fargo whereby the due dates on the loans were accelerated and the Company was required to take certain actions.     During 2015, as more fully described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and General, the Company took steps to pay down debt and increase liquidity.     On December 4, 2015, in conjunction with the sale of substantially all assets of the Company s Waste Services Segment, the Company paid off the KY Bank loans and certain Wells Fargo loans.     As of December     31, 2015, the Company had an outstanding balance of     $ 19.7  thousand to Wells Fargo.    Additionally, o  n February 29, 2016, the Company closed on new financing with MidCap and paid off in full remaining amounts due to Wells Fargo.     Additionally on February 29, 2016, the Company converted certain amounts payable to related parties into unsecured term notes payable to the same related parties as more fully described in Note 6 - Related Party Transactions.     See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and General below for further details.  
     
  MidCap:  
     
  On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into the 2016 Loan, which is a     $6.0 million senior, secured asset-based line of credit with MidCap.     The Company may borrow up to the sum of     (a)      85 %     of the value of its eligible domestic accounts receivable; (b) the lesser of (i)     $2.5 million and (ii)      75 %     of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory; and (c) the lesser of (i)     $ 500,000  and (ii)      40 %     of appraised net forced liquidation value of eligible fixed assets (the "Equipment Sublimit").     The Equipment Sublimit shall amortize monthly on a straight line basis over   six  ty ( 60 ) months with no reduction to the overall line of credit availability.  
     
  Proceeds from this loan were used to pay transaction expenses, pay off and close the remaining balance on the Wells Fargo revolving line of credit and fund working capital requirements.  
     
  The interest rate on the 2016 Loan is equal to the prime rate ( 3.5 % as of September 30, 2016) plus     250 basis points ( 2.50 %).     In the Event of a Default (as defined in the 2016 Loan Agreement), the interest rate will increase by     300 basis points ( 3.00 %).     The 2016 Loan also has a monthly collateral-monitoring fee equal to     27.5 basis points ( 0.275 %) of the average daily balance, an annual facility fee of     100 basis points ( 1.00 %) and an unused line fee equal to an annual rate of     50 basis points ( 0.50 %) of the average undrawn portion of the 2016 Loan.  
     
  The 2016 Loan has a maturity date of February 28, 2018.  
     
  The Company is subject to a prepayment fee of     $120.0 thousand     if the 2016 Loan is terminated or prepaid prior to the      one  year anniversary of the loan.     The Company is subject to a prepayment fee of     $60.0 thousand     if the 2016 Loan is terminated or prepaid subsequent to the one year anniversary of the loan, but prior to the maturity date.     The     $ 60.0  thousand fee is reduced to zero if the 2016 Loan is refinanced by an FDIC insured institution after      eighteen  months from February 29, 2016.  
     
  Interest and monthly fees under the 2016 Loan are payable monthly in arrears.  
     
  The 2016 Loan Agreement contains a minimum line availability covenant equal to     $350.0 thousand.     This covenant may be replaced by a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio ("FCCR") covenant once the Company has achieved a FCCR of 1.0x on an annualized basis.  
     
  The Company granted MidCap a first priority security interest in all of the assets of ISA pursuant to a Security Agreement.  
     
  The Company is allowed to sell or refinance up to     $3.0 million in fair market value of real property provided (i) the proceeds from such refinance or sale remain with the Company; and (ii) no event of default exists at the time of such refinance or sale.     
     
  The 2016 Loan had availability of     $ 1.8   million  as of   September    30   , 2016.  
     
  Wells Fargo:  
     
  On June 13, 2014, the Company entered into a senior, secured credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with Wells Fargo pursuant to which Wells Fargo granted the Company a revolving line of credit of up to     $15.0 million (the "Revolving Loan"), up to     $1.0 million of which was available to the Company as a sub-facility for letters of credit. As of December     31, 2015, all loans under the credit agreement except the Revolving Loan had been paid in full.     The Company was able to borrow up to      85 % of the value of  its eligible accounts receivable and      65 % of the value of eligible inventory under the Revolving Loan.     As of December     31, 2015, an availability block that limited borrowings under the revolver in the amount of     $ 1.6  million was in place.   

NOTE 3           LONG TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE TO BANK, Continued  

The Credit Agreement also provided the Company with a secured equipment term loan of     $ 2.8  million (the "Term Loan"). The Company used the proceeds from the Credit Agreement to repay in full its prior credit facility and no further amounts can be borrowed.     
     
  As of December     31, 2015, the Company had     $ 0.8  million available under the Revolving Loan.  
     
  The Bank of Kentucky:  
     
  Until December 4, 2015, WESSCO owed amounts under      two  promissory notes (collectively, the "KY Bank Notes") in favor of KY Bank,      one  in the amount of     $ 3.0  million (the "Term Note") and     one in the amount of     $1.0 million (the "Line of Credit Note").     Additionally, on January 15, 2015, the Company signed a new line of credit ("2015 Line of Credit Note") in the amount of     $1.0 million with KY Bank.     The draw period for the 2015 Line of Credit Note was set to expire on January 14, 2016.     All amounts under the KY Bank Notes were repaid on December 4, 2015 in conjunction with the sale of a majority of the assets of the Company's Waste Services Segment.     The Company used the proceeds from the Term Note to pay     $ 3.0  million against a previous Company loan.     WESSCO used proceeds from the Line of Credit Note and the 2015 Line of Credit Note to purchase additional equipment.     The Company signed a     $ 3.0  million demand promissory note in favor of WESSCO in exchange for the proceeds of WESSCO's Term Note.  All amounts owed to KY Bank were paid in full as of December 4, 2015 and no further amounts can be borrowed under the facilities.  
   
  Amounts owed to K R, LLC and 7100 Grade Lane, LLC are more fully described in  Note 6 - Related Party Transactions.   

Long term debt as of   September    30   , 2016 and     December     31, 2015 consisted of the following:

  On May 1, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Crane Lease, whereby the lease is extended through April 30, 2021. Payments are $ 14.5  thousand per month for the first  twelve  months following the amendment date, followed by monthly payments of $ 31.3  thousand thereafter for the reminder of the lease term. There is no bargain purchase option associated with the Crane Lease. Based on the new lease terms, the Company classified the Crane Lease as a capital lease. At inception, the Company recorded a capital lease obligation of $ 1.3  million. The Company used a weighted average cost of capital of  9.3 % to calculate the capital lease obligation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded $ 107.1  thousand in depreciation expense and $ 49.4  thousand in interest expense related to the Crane Lease.  

Future minimum lease payments for the next five twelve-months periods ending September 30 of each year, in thousands, as of September 30, 2016 are as follows:

NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
     
  During the periods ended September 30, 2016 and  2015 , the Company was involved in various transactions with related parties. A summary of transactions and related balances are as follows. The table at the end of this note should be used in referencing all below paragraphs.  
     
  K R, LLC ("K R") and  7100  Grade Lane, LLC (" 7100  LLC"):  
     
  The Company is involved in various transactions with K R and  7100  LLC, which are wholly-owned by Kletter Holdings LLC, the sole member of which was Harry Kletter, the Company's founder and former Chief Executive Officer. After Mr. Kletter's passing in January 2014, the Company's Chairman of the Board and interim Chief Executive Officer, Orson Oliver, assumed the roles of executor of Mr. Kletter s estate and President of Kletter Holdings LLC. As of September 30, 2016, Mr. Kletter s estate, K R and the Harry Kletter Family Limited Partnership collectively, beneficially own in excess of  20 % of the Company's issued and outstanding shares.

Additionally, the Company leased equipment from K R under operating leases that expired November 2015 and May 2016. See Note  4  - Lease Commitments for additional information relating to the rent and lease agreements with K R. During  2015  and continuing into  2016 , the Company deferred a portion of these lease payments.  A portion of this deferral was converted into a term note during  2016  as described below.  
     
  On September 13, 2013, K R made a $ 500.0  thousand refundable, non-interest bearing deposit with the Company related to K R's potential purchase of the Company's formerly owned real property located at  1565  East  4 th Street in Seymour, Indiana. The Company was permitted and used the deposited funds for general corporate purposes. K R did not acquire the property. Under the Company's lending arrangements, a refund of the deposit to K R would have to be approved by the Company's lenders. This amount was converted into a term note during  2016  as described below.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and  2015 , the Company had balances related to K R and  7100  LLC pertaining to refundable lease and property deposits  due  to and from the Company, rents payable from the Company, notes payable  due  from the Company, accrued interest  due  from the Company, interest expense, and rent expense.  
     
  On February 29, 2016, K R assigned its interest in the  7100  Lease to another entity,  7100  LLC, also controlled by Mr. Kletter s estate. At that time, the total amount  due  to the estate s various entities, which amounted to approximately $ 1.5  million and is inclusive of the $ 500.0  thousand noted above, became a subordinated, unsecured debt (the "Kletter Notes") owed by the Company. A portion of the amount, approximately $ 620.3  thousand, is owed to K R, with the remaining amount, approximating $ 883.8  thousand, owed to  7100  LLC. Interest will accrue monthly at a per annum rate of  5.0 %. Interest will accrue until April 30, 2017 at which time interest will be paid monthly. Until maturity on December 31, 2020, the Kletter Notes are subject to intercreditor agreements between the respective Note holder and MidCap. This amount of $ 1.5  million represents all net amounts  due  to Kletter estate entities as of February 29, 2016 with the exception of a $ 32.0  thousand deposit owed by K R to the Company. If the Company sells property it owns at  7110  Grade Lane in Louisville, Kentucky, it shall make a principal payment to K R of $ 500.0  thousand. Otherwise, all remaining principal is  due  at maturity.

Other Equity Transactions:  
     
  On August 5, 2015, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Algar, whereby the Company issued      50.7  thousand shares of its common stock to Algar for aggregate consideration equal to     $ 189.0  thousand based on the fair value of our common   stock.  The consideration was payable in the form of a partial reduction of the Company s       accrued but unpaid bonus compensation due to Algar for services rendered in 2014 pursuant to the Management Agreement between the Company and Algar.       See Note 6 - Related Party Transactions.

If the CFO's employment is terminated without cause (i) during 2016, the Company is required to pay him an amount equal to $ 100.0  thousand times the quotient of the number of full months he is employed during 2016 divided by 12, and (ii) during 2017, the Company is required to pay him an amount equal to $ 125.0  thousand times the quotient of the number of full months employed in 2017 divided by 12.  
   
   On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into retention agreements ("Retention Agreements") with certain management employees (individually "Staff Member").  Under the Retention Agreement, if the Staff Member remains continuously employed by the Company through and including the date which is the first to occur of: (a) the date of a change in control of the Company; (b) the date the Staff Member is terminated without cause; and (c) December 31, 2017, the Company will pay the Staff Member a bonus in an amount equal to  25 % of the Staff Member's then-current annual base salary.  At September 30, 2016, the Company has estimated this liability to be $ 132.7  thousand.  The Company will evaluate the liability on an ongoing basis, and will expense the liability through December 31, 2017 unless determined otherwise .  

NOTE 8 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
     
  The Company has litigation from time to time, including employment-related claims, none of which the Company currently believes to be material.  
     
  Our operations are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations, including laws and regulations addressing materials used in the processing of our products. In addition, certain of our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws and regulations or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial operating costs and capital expenditures, in addition to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations.     Certain of the Company's facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the Company and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities in material amounts could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where the Company disposed of materials from its operations, which could result in future expenditures that the Company cannot currently estimate and which could reduce its profits.     The Company records liabilities for remediation and restoration costs related to past activities when its obligation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.     Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to their present value.     Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.     Costs of ongoing compliance activities related to current operations are expensed as incurred.     Such compliance has not historically constituted a material expense to the Company.  

NOTE 9 - FINANCING AND RELATED MATTERS  
     
  Securities Purchase Agreement  
     
  On June 13, 2014, the Company issued      857,143  shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Securities Purchase Agreement") to RCP, an investment entity principally owned by Daniel M. Rifkin, the founder and CEO of MetalX, for an aggregate purchase price of     $ 3.0  million. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company also issued to RCP a      five -year warrant to purchase      857,143  additional shares of the Company's common stock, exercisable      6  months after the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement for an exercise price of     $ 5.00  per share and expiring June 13, 2019. The net proceeds were allocated between common stock and warrants based on the relative fair value of the common stock and the warrants.     The fair value of the warrants was estimated using a pricing model similar to that used for stock options. The Securities Purchase Agreement provides RCP with preemptive rights and a right of first refusal with respect to future securities offerings by the Company. The Company used the proceeds from the Securities Purchase Agreement for general corporate purposes including debt reduction, growth initiatives, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions.     
     
  Director Designation Agreement  
     
  On June 13, 2014, in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company and RCP entered into a Director Designation Agreement (the "Director Designation Agreement") pursuant to which RCP will have the right to designate, and require the Company's Board to appoint, up to      two  directors (each, a "  Designated Director  "). As of the date of this report, RCP had the right to designate      one  director. A Designated Director will hold office until (i) his or her term expires and such Designated Director's successor designated by RCP has been appointed or (ii) such Designated Director's earlier death, disability, disqualification, resignation or removal, and RCP shall have the right to appoint any successor to such Designated Director. RCP's designation rights terminate at such time that RCP and its affiliates collectively hold less than      5 % of the Company's outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the Director Designation Agreement, the Company and RCP agreed that the designation and appointment of the Designated Director nominees will not violate applicable law and will not cause the Company to become delisted from any securities exchange or other trading market.  

NOTE 10 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  
     
  As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and General, on December 4, 2015, the Company and WESSCO entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with Compactor Rentals pursuant to which the Company sold its      Waste Services Segment,      consisting of substantially all of the assets used in (i) the Company s commercial, retail and industrial waste and recycling management services business which the Company operated under the name      Computerized Waste Systems      or      CWS,      and (ii) the Company s equipment sales, rental and maintenance business for the commercial and industrial waste and recycling industry which the Company operated under the name      Waste Equipment Sales and Service Company."  
     
  The Company received cash consideration at closing of     $ 7.5  million, less     $ 150.0  thousand which was retained by Compactor Rentals in connection with working capital adjustments. Compactor Rentals assumed certain liabilities relating to the Waste Services Segment, including but not limited to, current liabilities, warranty liabilities, and post-closing liabilities incurred in connection with transferred contracts.

ITEM  2 : MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
     
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.  
     
  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  
   The following discussion and analysis contains certain financial predictions, forecasts and projections which constitute      forward-looking statements      within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from those financial predictions, forecasts and projections and there can be no assurance that we will achieve such financial predictions, forecasts and projections. Factors that could affect financial predictions, forecasts and projections include availability of liquidity, fluctuations in commodity prices and any conditions internal to our major customers, including loss of their accounts and other factors as listed in our Form 10-K for the year ended     December      31 ,  2015 , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   
     
  General  
  Industrial Services of America, Inc. (herein  ISA,  the  Company,   we,   us,   our,  or other similar terms) is a Louisville, Kentucky-based company that buys, processes and markets ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other recyclable commodities and sells used auto parts after buying and dismantling used automobiles. Prior to December 4, 2015, we were also a provider of waste services through our Waste Services Segment. Our only remaining segment is our Recycling Segment. The Recycling Segment collects, purchases, processes and sells ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal to steel mini-mills, integrated steel makers, foundries and refineries. We purchase ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal primarily from industrial and commercial generators of steel, aluminum, copper, stainless steel and other metals as well as from scrap dealers and retail customers who deliver these materials directly to our facilities. We process scrap metal through our sorting, cutting, baling, and until May 2015, our shredding operations. Our non-ferrous scrap recycling operations consist primarily of collecting, sorting and processing various grades of copper, aluminum, stainless steel and brass. Our used automobile yard primarily purchases automobiles so that retail customers can locate and remove used parts for purchase.  
     
  On December 4, 2015, the Company sold substantially all assets of its Waste Services Segment. The Waste Services Segment provided waste management services including contract negotiations with service providers, centralized billing, invoice auditing and centralized dispatching. This segment also rented, leased, sold and serviced waste handling and recycling equipment, such as trash compactors and balers, to end-use customers. The Waste Services Segment has been classified as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 205-20-55. Results of discontinued operations are excluded from the condensed consolidated financial information for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted. See Note  10  - Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
  Our core business is focused on the recycling industry. We intend to work to manage our costs, improve gross margins and increase scrap metal volumes at all of our facilities. We intend to continue to focus on efficiencies and productivity in our core business while a special committee of our Board of Directors assists the Board of Directors in evaluating strategic alternatives.  
     
  From December  2014  through September 30, 2016, the Company was managed under a Management Services Agreement ( Management Agreement ) with Algar, Inc. ( Algar ). Under the Management Agreement, Algar provided us with day-to-day senior executive level operating management services. Algar also provided business, financial, and organizational strategy and consulting services, as our Board of Directors reasonably requested from time to time.    
   
  In connection with the ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives, on September 30, 2016, the Company and Algar mutually agreed to terminate the Management Services Agreement pursuant to the Agreement to Terminate Management Services among the Company, Algar, and Sean Garber dated as of September 30, 2016 (the "Termination Agreement").  See  Note 6 - Related Party Transactions for further details.   
   
    Effective September 30, 2016, Mr. Garber resigned from all positions with the Company, including as President, and the Board appointed Todd Phillips as President.  Mr. Phillips has been the Company's CFO since December 31, 2014 and will continue to serve in that role.    
      
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
     
  Our cash requirements generally consist of working capital, capital expenditures and debt service. Our primary sources of liquidity during 2015 and the first half of 2016 were cash flows generated from asset sales, the idling of our auto shredder operation and the refinancing of the Company's working line of credit. These steps are more fully described below and in the accompanying Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows generated from operations and our revolving credit facility are significant sources of ongoing liquidity. We d rew  $  2.3  million  on our revolving credit facility during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  We have also been able to manage liquidity by deferring certain rent payments made to related parties, as well as deferring capital expenditures. See Note 6 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We actively manage our working capital and associated cash requirements and continually seek more effective use of cash. As of September 30, 2016, we held cash and cash  equivalents   of $ 0.5  million.    

During  2015 , the Company experienced significant liquidity challenges related to the severe metal market downturn and associated loan defaults. Management took the below steps. Also, for further detail, see "The Company's Response to  2015  Commodity Markets and Liquidity Conditions" in Note  1  - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and General in the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
  In February 2015, the Company sold its Seymour, Indiana property and relocated its Seymour operations to a leased facility in the same general geographic area. The proceeds from the sale of this property were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.  
     
  In April 2015, the Company sold its property located at  6709  Grade Lane, Louisville, KY to a related party. The proceeds from the sale of this property were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.  
   
  In May 2015, the Company warm idled its auto shredder. The proceeds associated with working capital reductions were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.  
     
  Also, in May 2015, the Company sold its property located at  7017  Grade Lane, Louisville, KY to a related party. The proceeds from the sale of this property were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.  
     
  In November 2015, the Company entered into a forbearance agreement with Wells Fargo, which required certain actions by the Company.  
     
  In December 2015, the Company sold substantially all assets of the Company s Waste Services Segment. Proceeds from the sale of this segment were used to reduce debt and improve liquidity.  
     
  During  2015 , the Company paid down debt by $ 16.3  million and favorably improved borrowing availability, primarily as a result of the above actions. As more fully described in Note  10  - Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Waste Services Segment provided positive operating cash flow that will no longer be available to the Company.  
     
  On February 29, 2016, the Company refinanced its Wells Fargo debt with a new lender, MidCap, which provides improved liquidity.  
     
  Our sources of liquidity from  2014  to present have primarily consisted of proceeds from asset and equity sales as well as the idling of our auto shredder and refinancing of our working capital line of credit. Influenced primarily by the length and depth of the metals market downturn and the Company's ongoing operating losses, we may not be able to fund our future capital needs, including necessary working capital, funds for capital expenditures or debt service, from operating cash flow. Consequently, we may have to rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs or we may have to rely on further asset sales or similar actions. We may be unable to obtain third-party financing or conduct asset sales on favorable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash flow and liquidity. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that sufficient liquidity can be raised from  one  or more of these sources or that a desired transaction could be consummated within the period needed to meet certain obligations.  
     
  Credit facilities and notes payable  
     
  During  2015 , the Company had certain loans with KY Bank and Wells Fargo. As of December 31, 2014, the Company was in default under the Wells Fargo loans and during the second half of  2015  entered into a Forbearance Agreement with Wells Fargo whereby the  due  dates on the loans were accelerated and the Company was required to take certain actions.  
     
  During  2015 , as more fully described above, the Company took steps to pay down debt and increase liquidity.  
     
  On December 4, 2015, in conjunction with the above-noted sale of substantially all assets of the Company s Waste Services Segment, the Company paid off the KY Bank loans and certain Wells Fargo loans. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had an outstanding balance of $ 19.7  thousand to Wells Fargo. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, the Company closed on new financing with MidCap and paid off in full remaining amounts  due  to Wells Fargo.  
     
  See Note  1  - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and General and Note  3  - Long Term Debt and Notes Payable to Bank in the accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on long term debt and notes payable.  

Results of Operations  
     
  The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the percentage relationship that certain captioned items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations bear to total revenue:  

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015    
     
  Total revenue   decreased   $ 13.6  million or  34.4%  to $ 26.0  million in the  nine  month period ended  2016  compared to $ 39.6  million in the same period in  2015 . This decrease was primarily  due  to the May 2015 warm idle of the Company's shredder operations, which despite a portion of volume shifting to the Company's ferrous operations resulted in a significant decrease in revenue, as well as significant metal commodity price declines and associated volume decreases. Revenue from the Company's shredder operations were $ 0.0  million for the  nine   month period ended   2016  and $ 11.9  million for the same period in  2015 , a decrease of $ 11.9  million. The remaining decrease was  due  primarily as a result of lower average selling prices (ASP) coupled with a related decrease in nonferrous volumes, partially offset by increased ferrous volumes. Nonferrous material shipments decreased by  3.7  million pounds, or  14.1 %, along with a decrease in the average selling price of nonferrous material of $ 0.10  per pound, or  11.4 %, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company experienced a decrease in the average selling price of ferrous material of $ 43  per gross ton, or  18.6 %. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company experienced an increase in ferrous material shipments of  14.5  thousand tons, or  38.0 %. This increase in ferrous material shipments was primarily a result of the May 2015 warm idle of the Company's shredder operations.  Due  to the idling of the Company's shredder operations, a portion of materials previously sold and classified as shredder shipments during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were purchased and sold through the ferrous operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
     
  Total cost of sales   decreased   $ 17.8  million or  41.2%  to $ 25.4  million in the  nine   month period ended   2016  compared to $ 43.2  million for the same period in  2015 . This decrease was primarily  due  to the May 2015 warm idling of the Company's shredder operations as well as significant metal commodity price declines and associated scrap metal volume decreases. Cost of sales from the Company s shredder operations were $ 1.3  million for the  nine  month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $ 14.9  million for the  nine  month period ended September 30, 2015, resulting in a $ 13.6  million decrease. The remaining decrease in cost of sales relates to lower shipping volumes for non-ferrous and lower metal commodity prices as noted in the above paragraph.  
     
  Total cost of sales as a percent of revenue was lower during the  nine   month period ended   2016  as compared to the same period in  2015 . The metals commodity markets improved during the second quarter of  2016  as compared to the same period in  2015 , which, despite lower ASP, allowed for improved gross margins.  
     
  SG A expenses   increased   $ 0.6  million to $ 3.5  million in the  nine   month period ended   2016  compared to $ 2.9  million in the same period in  2015 . As a percentage of revenue, SG A expenses were  13.4%  in  2016  compared to  7.3%  in  2015 .   
     
  SG A expenses increased primarily  due  to (i) an increase in bonus expense of $ 0.4  million related to amounts accrued but not yet paid under the Algar Management Agreement along with (ii) amounts accrued but not yet paid under a retention agreement entered into with our CFO on March 25, 2016, and (iii) an increase in share based compensation expense of $0.2 million mainly related to the June 15, 2016 one-time stock exchange for the CFO as an alternative to a direct repricing of options previously granted to the CFO.  

Other income (expense) was expense of $ 52.0  thousand for the  nine  month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to expense of $ 71.0  thousand for the  nine  month period ended September 30, 2015. This $ 19.0  thousand change is a result of a $ 112.0  thousand decrease in interest expense, which is a result of the significant steps that the Company took during  2015  to reduce debt and improve liquidity; a $ 322.0  thousand decrease in the gain on sale of assets, which was primarily  due  to a gain during the first quarter of  2015  on the sale of our former Seymour, Indiana location and moving our facility to a leased property in the same general area; along with a $ 229.0   thousand increase in other income, which was primarily due to a gain on insurance proceeds. We filed an insurance claim related to six roofs on certain of our buildings due to weather related damage.  In the third quarter of  2016   we received insurance proceeds in the amount of $ 571.4  thousand related to this claim. We recognized a gain of $ 233.3   thousand, net of   $80.0 thousand impairment write-downs of the related roofs, consulting fees related to the claim, and amounts set aside in accrual for repairs on leased properties .        
     
  The income tax provision   increased   $ 62.0  thousand to $ 77.0  thousand in the n ine month period ended   2016  compared to $ 15.0  thousand in the same period in  2015 . The effective tax rates in 2016 and  2015  were  ( 2.6 )% and ( 0.2 )% , respectively, based on federal and state statutory rates.  Due  to recurring operating losses being incurred, at December 31, 2013, we recorded nearly a full valuation allowance, which is continuing through September 30, 2016. We also have several state and franchise taxes payable based on gross receipts.  
     
    Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to three months ended September 30, 2015    
   
  Total revenue   increased   $ 0.3  million or  3.2%  to $ 9.9  million in the third quarter of  2016  compared to $ 9.6  million in the same period in  2015 . This increase was  due  primarily to increased ferrous volumes, partially offset by lower average selling prices (ASP) coupled with a related decrease in nonferrous volumes. Nonferrous material shipments decreased by  0.7  million pounds, or  8.1 %, along with a decrease in the average selling price of nonferrous material of $ 0.05  per pound, or  5.6 %, for the third quarter of  2016  compared to same period in  2015 . For the third quarter of  2016  compared to same period in  2015 , the Company experienced a decrease in the average selling price of ferrous material of $ 21  per gross ton, or  10.0 %. In the third quarter of  2016  compared to the same period in  2015 , the Company experienced an increase in ferrous material shipments of  4.8  thousand tons, or  31.0 %.   
     
  Total cost of sales   decreased   $ 0.4  million or  3.9%  to $ 9.8  million in the third quarter of  2016  compared to $ 10.2  million for the same period in  2015 . This decrease was  due  in part to the May 2015 warm idling of the Company's shredder operations as well as significant metal commodity price declines and associated scrap metal volume decreases. Cost of sales from the Company s shredder operations were $ 0.4  million for the  three  month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $ 0.6  million for the  three  month period ended September 30, 2015, resulting in a $ 0.2  million decrease. The remaining decrease in cost of sales relates to lower shipping volumes for non-ferrous and lower metal commodity prices as noted in the above paragraph.  
     
  Total cost of sales as a percent of revenue was lower during the third quarter of  2016  as compared to the same period in  2015 . These improved gross margins are, despite falling commodity prices, largely a result of better market conditions in the third quarter of    2016  as compared to the same period in  2015 .    
     
  SG A expenses   increased   $ 0.2  million to $ 1.1  million in the third quarter of  2016  compared to $ 0.9  million in the same period in  2015 . As a percentage of revenue, SG A expenses were  11.1%  in  2016  compared to  9.0%  in  2015 .  
     
  SG A expenses increased primarily  due  to an increase in share based compensation expense of $ 53.0  thousand,  increase in bonus expense of $ 62.0  thousand related to amounts accrued but not yet paid under the Algar Management Agreement along with amounts accrued but not yet paid under a retention agreement entered into with our CFO on March 25, 2016, and an increase in director expense of $61.0  thousand  .  
   
  Other income (expense) was income of $ 108.0  thousand for the  three  month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to expense of $ 112.0  thousand for the  three  month period ended September 30, 2015. This $ 220.0  thousand change is a result of a $ 25.0  thousand increase in interest expense, which related to interest expense on a capital lease in the third quarter of 2016, and a $ 243.0  thousand increase in other income,  which was primarily due to a gain on insurance proceeds.  We filed an insurance claim related to six roofs on certain of our buildings due to weather related damage.   In the third quarter of  2016  we received insurance proceeds in the amount of $ 571.4  thousand related to this claim. We recognized a gain of $ 233.3   thousand, net of   $80.0 thousand impairment write-downs of the related roofs, consulting fees related to the claim, and amounts set aside in accrual for repairs on leased properties          .       

The income tax provision   increased   $ 30.0  thousand to $ 37.0  thousand in the third quarter of  2016  compared to a $ 7.0  thousand in the same period in  2015 . The effective tax rates in  2016  and  2015  were  ( 4.1 )% and ( 0.4 )% , respectively, based on federal and state statutory rates.  Due  to recurring operating losses being incurred, at December 31, 2013, we recorded nearly a full valuation allowance, which is continuing through September 30, 2016. We also have several state and franchise taxes payable based on gross receipts.  
   
   Financial condition at   September 30  ,  2016  compared to     December      31 ,  2015    
     
  Cash and cash equivalents   decreased   $ 0.1  million to $ 0.5  million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $ 0.6  million as of December 31, 2015.  
     
  Net cash used in operating activities was $ 2.2  million for the  nine  month period ended September 30, 2016.    The net cash used in operating activities is primarily  due  to a net loss of $ 3.0  million,   an increase   in receivables of $ 1.5  million,  an increase   in inventories of $ 0.5  million, and  a decrease   in accounts payables of $ 0.5  million; partially offset by  a decrease   in receivables from related parties of $ 151.0  thousand, depreciation of $ 1.7  million, stock option expense of $ 333.0  thousand, and  an increase   in other current liabilities of $ 421.0  thousand. The  company  had  $ 8.0   thousand   of  capital  expenditures in  2016 .  
     
  Net cash from financing activities was $ 2.1  million for the  nine  month period ended September 30, 2016. In the  nine  month period ended September 30, 2016, we received net proceeds from debt of $ 2.3  million less capitalized loan fees in the amount of $ 241.0  thousand.  
     
  Accounts receivable trade   increased  $ 1.5  million or  88.8%  to $ 3.2  million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $ 1.7  million as of December 31, 2015  due  to a substantial increase in volume in September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015, as well as modest commodity price increases. In general, the accounts receivable balance fluctuates  due  to the timing of shipments and receipt of customer payments.  
   
  Accounts receivables from related parties   decreased   $ 151.0  thousand to $ 57.0  thousand as of September 30, 2016 compared to $ 208.0  thousand as of December 31, 2015. This decrease was  due  to timing of cash receipts.  
     
  Inventories consist principally of ferrous and nonferrous scrap materials. We value inventory at the lower of cost or market. Inventory   increased   $ 0.5  million, or  20.3% , to $ 2.9  million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $ 2.4  million as of December 31, 2015. This increase is primarily driven by seasonality resulting in increased volumes and inventory levels during the third quarter of  2016  compared to the fourth quarter of  2015 .  
     
   Inventory aging for the period ended     September      30 ,  2016  (Days Outstanding):   

Inventory aging for the period ended     December      31 ,  2015  (Days Outstanding):   

Inventory in the " 1 - 30  days" category increased by $ 313.0  thousand from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. This increase is primarily  due  to increased seasonal volumes during September 2016 as compared to December 2015.   
     
  Accounts payable trade   decreased   $ 0.5  million or  22.1%  to $ 1.7  million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $ 2.2  million as of December 31, 2015. The accounts payable balance fluctuates  due  to timing of purchases from and payments made to our vendors. This decrease is largely a result of improved liquidity which led to quicker payments to the Company's suppliers.  
     
   Accounts payables and accrued expenses from related parties   decreased   $ 1.3  million to $ 0.7  million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $ 1.9  million as of December 31, 2015.  This decrease is largely a result of t   he C ompany entering into a subordinated, unsecured debt with related parties on February 29, 2016, which converted amounts previously held as related party payables, in the amount of $ 1.5  million. See Note  6  - Related Party Transactions for additional information    

Working capital   increased   $ 2.7  million to $ 3.5  million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $ 0.8  million as of December 31, 2015 as a result of the above noted items.   
     
  The increase was primarily  due  to  an increase   in accounts receivables of $ 1.5  million, and   an increase   in inventories of $ 0.5  million, as well as  a decrease   in accounts payable and payable to related parties of $ 0.5  million and  $ 1.3  million,  respectively, offset by  a decrease   in receivables from related parties of $ 151.0  thousand,   a decrease   in  prepaid expenses  of $ 91.0  thousand, and  an increase   in  current maturities  of capital lease obligations of $ 144.0  thousand.  
     
  Contractual Obligations  
     
   The following table  provides information with respect to our known contractual obligations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

( 1 ) 

See Note  4  - Lease Commitments and Note  6  - Related Party Transactions for detailed information related to the Company's operating lease obligations. 

( 2 ) 

All interest commitments under interest-bearing debt are included in this table for which changes in value are accounted for in other comprehensive income. 

Long-term debt, including the current portions thereof,   increased   $ 3.8  million to $ 3.8  million as of September 30, 2016 compared to $ 20.0  thousand as of December 31, 2015. As discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section above, the Company took steps in  2015  to pay down debt and increase liquidity. On December 4, 2015, in conjunction with the sale of substantially all assets of the Company s Waste Services Segment, the Company paid off the substantially of all its debt. On February 29, 2016, the Company refinanced its remaining debt with a new lender. During the  nine  month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company received net proceeds from debt of $ 2.3  million. Additionally, on February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a subordinated, unsecured debt with related parties, which converted amounts previously held as related party payables, in the amount of $ 1.5  million. See Note  6  - Related Party Transactions for additional information.  
   
   On May 1, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to a previous operating lease, whereby the lease is extended through April 30, 2021.    Based on the new lease terms, the Company classified the amended lease as a capital lease.  At inception, the Company recorded a capital lease obligation of $ 1.3    million.    As of September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded $ 107.1    thousand in depreciation expense and $ 49.4    thousand in interest expense related to the capital lease.   See Note  4  - Lease Commitments for additional information.     
     
  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU  2014 - 09 ,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic  606 ).  The amendments in ASU  2014 - 09  affect any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We have not yet assessed the impact of the adoption of ASU  2014 - 09  on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.  2014 - 15 ,  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic  205 - 40 ) . The amendments in ASU  2014 - 15  are intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued.  We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   
   
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU  2015 - 03 ,  Interest-Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . The guidance requires an entity to present debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, rather than as an asset. Amortization of debt issuance costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. Debt issuance costs related to revolving credit arrangements, however, will continue to be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the arrangement. ASU  2015 - 03  is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 including interim periods within those annual periods. Upon adoption, ASU  2015 - 03  should be applied on a retrospective basis. We adopted ASU  2015 - 03  in the third quarter of  2016  and presented debt issuance costs related to a revolving credit arrangement as an asset which will amortize ratably over the term of the arrangement.  
     
   In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU  2015 - 11 ,   Inventory  , which simplifies the measurement principle of inventories valued under the First-In, First-Out ("FIFO") or weighted average methods from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU  2015 - 11  is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within those annual periods. We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   
     
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU  2015 - 17 ,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. ASU  2015 - 17  is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Upon adoption, ASU  2015 -17 may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.  2016 - 02 ,  Leases , to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease assets ( lessees ) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than  twelve  months. A lease liability is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee s right to use, or control use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU simplify the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. This ASU leaves the accounting for the organizations that own the assets leased to the lessee ( lessor ) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and Topic  606 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  
     
  The amendments in ASU  2016 - 02  are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of ASU  2016 - 02  on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
   
   In   August   201  6  , the FASB issued ASU 2016-1  5  ,   Statement of Cash Flows,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   , which provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Upon adoption, ASU 2016-15 should be applied retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
     
   N/A - Not required for smaller reporting companies.      
     
    ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
     
  (a) Disclosure controls and procedures.  
     
  ISA s management, including ISA s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our      disclosure controls and procedures,      as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon their evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of   September     30, 2016, ISA s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that ISA files under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to ISA s management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure.  
     
  (b) Changes to internal control over financial reporting.  
     
  There were no changes in ISA s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended   September 30  , 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect ISA s internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II           OTHER INFORMATION    
     
    Item 1.     Legal Proceedings.    
     
  The Company has litigation from time to time, including employment-related claims, none of which the Company currently believes to be material.  
     
   Our operations are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations, including laws and regulations addressing materials used in the processing of our products. In addition, certain of our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws and regulations or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial operating costs and capital expenditures, in addition to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations.     Certain of the Company's facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the Company and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Environmental liabilities in material amounts could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where the Company disposed of materials from its operations, which could result in future expenditures that the Company cannot currently estimate and which could reduce its profits.     The Company records liabilities for remediation and restoration costs related to past activities when its obligation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.     Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to their present value.     Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.     Costs of ongoing compliance activities related to current operations are expensed as incurred.     Such compliance has not historically constituted a material expense to the Company.   
     
    Item 1A.     Risk Factors.    
     
   There have been no material changes in our risk factors as previously disclosed in Part 1,      Item 1A. Risk Factors      of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended     December     31, 2015. You should carefully consider the risk factors in our 2015 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.   
     
    Item 2.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.    
     
  None.  
     
    Item 3.     Defaults upon Senior Securities.    
     
  None.  
     
    Item 4.     Mine Safety Disclosures.    
     
  Not applicable.  
     
    Item 5.     Other Information.    
     
  None.
