1.   
     
        NATURE OF OPERATIONS     
 Theron Resource Group (the "Company", "Theron", or "THRO") was
incorporated in the State of Wyoming on April 11, 2006. There have been no
material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of any
significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business since the
date of incorporation. The Company has not yet commenced any revenue-generating
operations, does not have any cash flows from operations, and is dependent on
debt and equity funding to finance its operations.  

2.   
     
        BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING
  CONCERN     
  Basis of Presentation   
 The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ( U.S. GAAP ).  
 The financial statements of the Company as of and for the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments)
have been made that are necessary to present fairly the financial position of
the Company as of September 30, 2016, the results of its operations for the
three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and its cash
flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Operating results
for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for a full fiscal year. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015
has been derived from the Company's audited financial statements included in the
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 The statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations. These financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the financial statements and other information included
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015, as filed with the SEC.  
  Going Concern   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared under
the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Such assumption
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, we have an accumulated
deficit of $513,861 and a stockholders  deficiency of $75,609. We have incurred
recurring losses from operations, and utilized cash flow in operating activities
of $73,215 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These factors, among
others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting
firm, in its report on the Company s December 31, 2015 financial statements, has
raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  
 Management s plan to support the Company in operations and to
maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public offerings, to
effect a merger or acquisition with an operating company and to rely on officers
and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation. If we do
not raise all of the money we need from public offerings or effect any merger or
acquisition, we will have to find alternative sources, such as a private
placement of securities or loans or advances from our officers, directors or
others. Such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms
and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the Company
does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term. Even if the
Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue
restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause
substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. If
we require additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend
operations or cease business entirely. 
 The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the
amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
  POLICIES     
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 Effective January 1, 2008, fair value measurements are
determined by our adoption of authoritative guidance issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), with the exception of the application of
the statement to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as
permitted. The adoption of the authoritative guidance did not have a material
impact on our fair value measurements. Fair value is defined in the
authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for
the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy was established, which prioritizes
the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:  
 Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities.  
 Level 2 Inputs, other than the quoted
prices in active markets, are observable either directly or indirectly.  
 Level 3 Unobservable inputs based on
our assumptions.  
 We are required to use observable market data if such data is
available without undue cost and effort.  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair values of
accounts payable approximate their carrying values.  
  Comprehensive Income   
 Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and
losses affecting stockholders  equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from
net income. There was no recorded comprehensive income or loss for both the
three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  Use of Estimates   
 In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in
the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of operations.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share   
 Our computation of earnings per share ("EPS") includes basic
and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as the income (loss) available to common
stockholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution, using
the treasury stock method, that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in
the issuance of common stock that then shared in the income (loss) of the
Company as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented,
or issuance date, if later. In computing diluted income (loss) per share, the
treasury stock method assumes that outstanding options and warrants are
exercised and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average
market price during the period. Options and warrants may have a dilutive effect
under the treasury stock method only when the average market price of the common
stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and warrants.
Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that
increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the
calculation of diluted EPS.  
 7 

Income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net
income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the respective periods. Basic and diluted (loss) per common
share is the same for periods in which the company reported an operating loss
because all warrants and stock options outstanding are anti-dilutive.  
 There were no adjustments to net loss required for purposes of
computing dilutive earnings per share.  
 For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, there were no potential dilutive securities.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   
 On August 27, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15,  Disclosures of
Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which
provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern
uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management
to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as
a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.
An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise
substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The
ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU
2014-15 on its results of operations or financial condition.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes". The
objective of this Update is to simplify the presentation of deferred income
taxes. The amendments in this Update require that deferred assets and
liabilities be classified as long-term on the balance sheet instead of
separating the deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. For a public
entity, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that
reporting period. Early application is permitted for financial statements that
have not been previously issued. The Company believes that this treatment of
deferred taxes reduces the complexity of financial reporting while improving the
usefulness of the information provided to users of the financial statements. As
a result, the Company has elected to early adopt this Update prospectively as of
November 30, 2015 and prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted.  
 On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230)". Stakeholders indicated that there is diversity in
practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and
classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash
Flows, and other Topics. This Update addresses eight specific cash flow issues
with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The
amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If
an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments
should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that
interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the
amendments in the same period.  
 Other accounting pronouncements did not or are not believed by
management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future
financial statements.

        RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS     
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company s stockholders provided net advances of $73,215 and $63,418,
respectively, to finance the Company s working capital requirements.  
 Advances from stockholders are unsecured, due on demand, and
non-interest bearing. The outstanding advances from stockholders totaled
$273,193 as of December 31, 2015. On May 23, 2016 the outstanding advances from
a stockholder of $334,756 has been waived in full (Please see Note 6).  
 During the three months and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company s office facility has been provided without charge by
the Company s major stockholder. Such cost was not material to the financial
statements and accordingly, has not been reflected therein. In view of the
Company s limited operations and resources, the major stockholder agreed not to
receive any payment from the Company relating to its use of such office facility
during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

5.   
     
        PROMISSORY NOTE PAYABLE   IN
  DEFAULT     
 On March 3, 2011, the Company obtained a $50,000 loan from an
unrelated party as evidenced by a promissory note (the  Promissory Note ). The
loan is unsecured and bears interest at 5% per annum and matured on March 3,
2012. The funds were used to repay all outstanding stockholder loans and
accounts payable and to provide working capital through November 30, 2012. 
 In connection with the share purchase described under Note 6
herein, Horizon Investment Club Limited ( Horizon ) entered into a Deed of
Waiver and Assumption of Debt (the  Waiver ) with the Company pursuant to which
Horizon and the Company agreed and confirmed that the Company novates and
transfers to Horizon all its obligations and liabilities under the Promissory
Note including all principal amount, accrued interests, or default interests
arising thereunder and such other liabilities accrued or incurred by the Company
prior to the closing of the share purchase, which is July 2, 2016. 
 However, the assignment of the Promissory Note has not been
consented by the creditor because the creditor has been lost in contact, the
Company may still hold liable until the earlier of (i) the loan is paid off,
(ii) the creditor consents to the Waiver or (iii) the statutes of limitation of
the Promissory Note expires on March 3, 2022. Therefore, the Promissory Note is
currently deemed to be in default despite the Waiver.  
 During the three months and nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company accrued $625 and $1,875 in interest payable under the note,
respectively, as compared to $625 and $1,875 for the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  

6.   
     
        STOCKHOLDER CONTRIBUTION     
 Horizon entered into an agreement dated May 23, 2016 with the
Company to waive the Company s balance due to Horizon of $307,818. On May 23,
2016, Horizon further consented to waive a sum of $26,938 receivable from the
Company. Horizon was the Company s major stockholder and on May 23, 2016 it
entered into a share purchase agreement to sell all its shares of the Company to
Red Point Holdings L.P., an Exempted Limited Partnership registered in the
Cayman Islands. A gain from extinguishment of these liabilities of $334,756 was
recorded as capital contribution in equity.  

7.   
     
        COMMITMENTS     
 On February 21, 2007, the Company optioned a property
containing nine mineral claim blocks in southwestern British Columbia, Canada.
Upon exercise of the option, the Company is required to pay, commencing May 31,
2013, $25,000 per annum, as royalty. The Company currently does not intend to
exercise the option on the claim.

ITEM 2.   
      MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN
      OF OPERATION.     
  CAUTIONARY     NOTE     REGARDING  
  FORWARD-LOOKING     STATEMENTS   
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements.
These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.
Some discussions in this report may contain forward-looking statements that
involve risk and uncertainty. A number of important factors could cause our
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements made by us in this report. Forward-looking statements are often
identified by words like:  believe,   expect,   estimate,   anticipate, 
 intend,   project,   goal,   seek,   strategy,   future,   likely,  and similar
expressions or words which, by their nature, refer to future events.  
 In some cases, you can also identify forward-looking statements
by terminology such as  may,   will,   should,   plans,   predicts,   potential 
or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of
activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from future
results, levels of activity, performance or achievements stated or implied by
these statements.  
 As used in this quarterly report, the terms  we,   us,   our, 
 Theron  and  THRO  mean Theron Resource Group, unless otherwise indicated.  
 Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the
forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity or achievements. Except as required by applicable law,
including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update
any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual
results.  
 Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars
( USD  or  US$  or  $ ) and are prepared in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. All references to  common shares 
refer to the common shares in our capital stock.  
  Overview   
 We were incorporated in the State of Wyoming on April 11, 2006
as Theron Resource Group. There have been no material reclassifications,
mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of
assets not in the ordinary course of business since the date of
incorporation. 
 On February 21, 2007, the Company optioned a property
containing nine mineral claim blocks in southwestern British Columbia, Canada.
Through August 31, 2008, Theron paid $20,000 for exploration expenditures on
certain mining claims.  
 Upon exercise of the option, we are required to pay, commencing
May 31, 2013, $25,000 per annum, as royalty. The Company currently does not
intend to exercise the option on the claim. 
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
 The Company did not generate any revenues from operations for
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  REVENUE   
 No revenue was generated for the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES   
 General and administrative expenses amounted to $11,652 and
$8,792 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and
$72,685 and $50,668 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The Company s general and administrative expenses mainly represent
professional fees incurred for its SEC filings.  
  OTHER INCOME   
 Other income for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 represents a reverse of overprovision for expenses.  
 10 

INTEREST EXPENSE   
 Interest expense for both the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 amounted to $625, and for both the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 amounted to $1,875. Interest expense for these periods is
attributable to the $50,000 unsecured promissory note we issued in March 2011
with an annual interest of 5%.  
  INCOME TAX PROVISION   
 As a result of operating losses, there has been no provision
for the payment of income taxes to date in 2016.  
  NET LOSS   
 For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the net losses were $12,277 and $71,160, compared to net losses of $9,417 and
$52,543 for the similar periods last year. The losses per share was $0.00 to
each period for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and $0.01 to
each period for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The loss per
share was based on a weighted average of 7,900,000 common shares outstanding at
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
 The Company continues to carefully control its expenses and
overall costs as it moves its business development plan forward.    
  PLAN OF OPERATION   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had a stockholders  deficiency of
$75,609.  
 We have not generated any revenues and have relied from
shareholder advances and debt and equity offerings to finance our operating and
capital expenses. We have incurred operating losses since inception. The working
capital requirements of the new business may be substantial and may depend on
the terms of our potential acquisitions, whether for stock, debt or cash, or a
combination, as appropriate.  
 Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current
operating and capital expenses, in their annual report on the financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, our independent auditors
included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note
disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our
independent auditors. Our issuance of additional equity securities could result
in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders.
Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will
increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  
 There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further
funds required for continued operations. We are pursuing various financing
alternatives to meet immediate and long-term financial requirements but results
to date have not been encouraging. We also seek to effect an acquisition or
merger with an operating company. However, there can be no assurance that
additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that
it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms and no assurance could be
given on any acquisition or merger. If we are not able to obtain the additional
financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our obligations as they
become due.  
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
 As of end of the three months and nine months on September 30,
2016, we have yet to generate any revenues from operations.  
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared under
the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Such assumption
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, we have an accumulated
deficit of $513,861 and a stockholders  deficiency of $75,609. We have incurred
recurring losses from operations, and utilized cash flow in operating activities
of $73,215 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These factors, among
others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting
firm, in its report on the Company s December 31, 2015 financial statements, has
raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Since our inception in April 2006, we have used our common
stock, promissory notes and loans or advances from our officers, directors and
stockholders to raise money for our optioned acquisition and for corporate
expenses. We issued 6,000,000 shares of common stock through a Section 4(2)
offering in October 2006 for cash consideration of $6,000. We issued 900,000
shares of common stock through a Regulation D offering in November 2006 for cash
consideration of $9,000 to a total of three subscribers. During May 2009,
$50,000 cash was provided by financing activities as the result of the sale of
1,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.05 per share issued under our
SB-2 registration statement to a total of 44 subscribers.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a note payable of
$50,000 plus accrued interest of $13,957. The note is unsecured and bears
interest at a rate of 5% per annum. The note matured on March 3, 2012 and is
currently in default.  
 As of September 30, 2016, we had no assets and our total
liabilities were $75,609, mainly including a promissory note payable of $50,000
and interest due thereon of $13,957. We had a working capital deficit of
$75,609.  
 NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES: For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $73,215 and $63,418 in net cash was used,
respectively.  
 CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES   For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we received advances from stockholders of
$73,215 and $63,418, respectively. There was no cash provided by equity
financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
No options or warrants were issued in the most recent period to purchase shares
in a later date.  
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources.  

ITEM 3.   
      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
      ABOUT MARKET RISK.     
 Not applicable.  

ITEM 4.   
      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a)   
     
        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
      Procedures.    

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are
      designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
      filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
      reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.
      This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely
      decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our
      principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the
      effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
      the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure
      controls and procedures were ineffective due to a control deficiency.
      During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow
      segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our
      information. Due to the size and operations of the Company, we are unable
      to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another
      company.   

Our management, including our principal executive officer
      and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure
      controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or
      fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
      provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
      the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
      reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of
      controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent
      limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
      absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
      have been detected. Accordingly, management believes that the financial
      statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects
      our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the
      periods presented.   

(b)   
     
        Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
      Reporting    

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there
      were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting
      (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially
      affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal
      control over financial reporting.
