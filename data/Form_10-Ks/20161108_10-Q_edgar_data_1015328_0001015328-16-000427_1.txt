WINTRUST FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(1)   Basis of Presentation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements of Wintrust Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries ( Wintrust  or  the Company ) presented herein are unaudited, but in the opinion of management reflect all necessary adjustments of a normal or recurring nature for a fair presentation of results as of the dates and for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited and do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015   Form 10-K ). Operating results reported for the three-month and nine-month periods are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the entire year. Reclassifications of certain prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation. 
    
  The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management believes that the estimates made are reasonable, however, changes in estimates may be required if economic or other conditions develop differently from management s expectations. Certain policies and accounting principles inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements. Management currently views the determination of the allowance for loan losses, allowance for covered loan losses and the allowance for losses on lending-related commitments, loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, estimations of fair value, the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill, the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments, and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available. Descriptions of the Company's significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  of the   2015   Form 10-K. 

(2)   Recent Accounting Developments 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which created "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for customer contracts. This ASU provides guidance regarding how an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also added a new subtopic to the codification, ASC 340-40, "Other Assets and Deferred Costs: Contracts with Customers" to provide guidance on costs related to obtaining and fulfilling a customer contract. Furthermore, the new standard requires disclosure of sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. At the time ASU No. 2014-09 was issued, the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. In July 2015, the FASB approved a deferral of the effective date by one year, which would result in the guidance becoming effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  
    
  The FASB has continued to issue various Updates to clarify and improve specific areas of ASU No. 2014-09. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)," to clarify the implementation guidance within ASU No. 2014-09 surrounding principal versus agent considerations and its impact on revenue recognition. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing," to also clarify the implementation guidance within ASU No. 2014-09 related to these two topics.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11, "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting," to remove certain areas of SEC Staff Guidance from those specific Topics. Additionally, in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients," to clarify specific aspects of implementation, including the collectibility criterion, exclusion of sales taxes collected from a transaction price, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition.  Like ASU No. 2014-09, this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.

     Table of Contents  

The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Extraordinary and Unusual Items 
    
  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01,  Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20):  Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items,  to eliminate the concept of extraordinary items related to separately classifying, presenting and disclosing certain events and transactions that meet the criteria for that concept. This guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Consolidation 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810):  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  which changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. This guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, "Consolidation (Topic 810):  Interest Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control,"   to amend guidance from ASU No. 2015-02 regarding how a reporting entity treats indirect interests  in a variable interest entity ("VIE") held through related parties under common control when determining whether the reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of such VIE  . This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a retrospective approach. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," to clarify the presentation of debt issuance costs within the balance sheet. This ASU requires that an entity present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, not as a separate asset. The ASU does not affect the current guidance for the recognition and measurement for these debt issuance costs. Additionally, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting)," to further clarify the presentation of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit agreements. This ASU states the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit agreements as an asset on the balance sheet and subsequently amortizing these costs ratably over the term of the agreement, regardless of any outstanding borrowing under the line-of-credit agreement. This guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and was applied retrospectively within the Company s consolidated financial statements. For December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, the Company reclassified as a direct reduction to the related debt balance   $7.8 million   and   $8.7 million  , respectively, of debt issuance costs that were previously presented as accrued interest receivable and other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 
    
  Business Combinations 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments," to simplify the accounting for subsequent adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date of a business combination. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustment for all prior periods impacted. The acquirer is required to recognize these adjustments identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. Additionally, the ASU requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment had been recognized at the acquisition date. This guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Financial Instruments 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," to improve the accounting for financial instruments. This ASU requires    equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

income regardless of classification. For equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, the value of the investment would be measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer instead of fair value, unless a qualitative assessment indicates impairment. Additionally, this ASU requires the separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and is to be applied prospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)," to improve transparency and comparability across entities regarding leasing arrangements. This ASU requires the recognition of a separate lease liability representing the required lease payments over the lease term and a separate lease asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the same lease term. Additionally, this ASU provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease as well as requires additional disclosures to the notes of the financial statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a modified retrospective approach, including the option to apply certain practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Derivatives 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships," to clarify guidance surrounding the effect on an existing hedging relationship of a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument. This ASU states that a change in counterparty to such derivative instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied either under a prospective or a modified retrospective approach. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Equity Method Investments 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, "Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323):  Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting," to simplify the accounting for investments qualifying for the use of the equity method of accounting. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when an investment qualifies for such method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The ASU requires the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest to the current basis and adopt the equity method of accounting as of that date going forward. Additionally, for available-for-sale equity securities that become qualified for equity method accounting, the ASU requires the related unrealized holding gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income be recognized in earnings at the date the investment qualifies for such accounting.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a prospective approach. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Employee Share-Based Compensation 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," to simplify the accounting for several areas of share-based payment transactions. This includes the recognition of all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense instead of surplus, the classification on the statement of cash flows of excess tax benefits and taxes paid when the employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. Additionally, related to forfeitures, the ASU provides the option to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a modified retrospective and retrospective approach based upon the specific amendment of the ASU.   The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments," to replace the current incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred, with a methodology that reflects an estimate of all expected credit losses and considers additional reasonable and supportable forecasted information when determining credit loss estimates. This impacts the calculation of the allowance for credit losses for all financial assets measured under the amortized cost basis, including purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans at the time of and subsequent to acquisition. Additionally, credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities would be recorded through the allowance for credit losses and not as a direct adjustment to the amortized cost of the securities. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a modified retrospective approach.   The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements as well as the impact on current systems and processes. 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force),"   to clarify the presentation of specific types of cash flow receipts and payments, including the payment of debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration cash payments paid subsequent to the acquisition date and proceeds from settlement of BOLI policies  . This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a retrospective approach, if practicable. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory," to improve the accounting for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This ASU allows the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for such transfers prior to the subsequent sale of the transferred assets to an outside party. Initial recognition of current and deferred income taxes is currently prohibited for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a modified retrospective approach through cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 

(3)   Business Combinations 
    
  Non-FDIC Assisted Bank Acquisitions 
    
  On   August 19, 2016  , the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Lake Forest Bank   Trust Company ("Lake Forest Bank"), acquired approximately   $560.9 million   in performing loans and related relationships from an affiliate of GE Capital Franchise Finance. The loans are to franchise operators (primarily quick service restaurant concepts) in the Midwest and in the Western portion of the United States. 
    
  On   March 31, 2016  , the Company acquired Generations Bancorp, Inc ("Generations").

Additionally, the Company recorded goodwill of   $11.5 million   on the acquisition. 
    
  On   July 24, 2015  , the Company acquired Community Financial Shares, Inc ("CFIS"). CFIS was the parent company of Community Bank - Wheaton/Glen Ellyn ("CBWGE"), which had   four   banking locations. CBWGE was merged into the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Wheaton Bank   Trust Company ("Wheaton Bank"). The Company acquired assets with a fair value of approximately   $350.5 million  , including approximately   $159.5 million   of loans, and assumed deposits with a fair value of approximately   $290.0 million  . Additionally, the Company recorded goodwill of   $27.6 million   on the acquisition. 
    
  On   July 17, 2015  , the Company acquired Suburban Illinois Bancorp, Inc. ("Suburban").

   9 

     Table of Contents  

approximately   $494.7 million  , including approximately   $257.8 million   of loans, and assumed deposits with a fair value of approximately   $416.7 million  . Additionally, the Company recorded goodwill of   $18.6 million   on the acquisition. 
    
  On   July 1, 2015  , the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Wintrust Bank,  acquired North Bank, which had   two   banking locations. The Company acquired assets with a fair value of   $117.9 million  , including approximately   $51.6 million   of loans, and assumed deposits with a fair value of approximately   $101.0 million  . Additionally, the Company recorded goodwill of   $6.7 million   on the acquisition.  
    
  On   January 16, 2015  , the Company acquired Delavan Bancshares, Inc. ("Delavan"). Delavan was the parent company of Community Bank CBD, which had   four   banking locations. Community Bank CBD was merged into the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Town Bank. The Company acquired assets with a fair value of approximately   $224.1 million  , including approximately   $128.0 million   of loans, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of approximately   $186.4 million  , including approximately   $170.2 million   of deposits. Additionally the Company recorded goodwill of   $16.8 million   on the acquisition. 
    
  FDIC-Assisted Transactions 
    
  Since 2010, the Company acquired the banking operations, including the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of liabilities, of   nine   financial institutions in FDIC-assisted transactions. Loans comprise the majority of the assets acquired in nearly all of these FDIC-assisted transactions, most of which are subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC whereby the FDIC has agreed to reimburse the Company for   80%   of losses incurred on the purchased loans, other real estate owned ( OREO ), and certain other assets. Additionally, clawback provisions within these loss share agreements with the FDIC require the Company to reimburse the FDIC in the event that actual losses on covered assets are lower than the original loss estimates agreed upon with the FDIC with respect of such assets in the loss share agreements. The Company refers to the loans subject to these loss sharing agreements as  covered loans  and uses the term  covered assets  to refer to covered loans, covered OREO and certain other covered assets.  The agreements with the FDIC require that the Company follow certain servicing procedures or risk losing the FDIC reimbursement of covered asset losses. 
    
  The loans covered by the loss sharing agreements are classified and presented as covered loans and the estimated reimbursable losses are recorded as an FDIC indemnification asset or other liability in the Consolidated Statements of Condition.  The Company recorded the acquired assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value for loans reflected expected credit losses at the acquisition date. Therefore, the Company will only recognize a provision for credit losses and charge-offs on the acquired loans for any further credit deterioration subsequent to the acquisition date. See Note 7   Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Impaired Loans for further discussion of the allowance on covered loans.  
    
  The loss share agreements with the FDIC cover realized losses on loans, foreclosed real estate and certain other assets and require the Company to record loss share assets and liabilities that are measured separately from the loan portfolios because they are not contractually embedded in the loans and are not transferable with the loans should the Company choose to dispose of them. Fair values at the acquisition dates were estimated based on projected cash flows available for loss share based on the credit adjustments estimated for each loan pool and the loss share percentages. The loss share assets and liabilities are recorded as FDIC indemnification assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, reimbursements received from the FDIC for actual incurred losses will reduce the FDIC indemnification assets. Reductions to expected losses, to the extent such reductions to expected losses are the result of an improvement to the actual or expected cash flows from the covered assets, will also reduce the FDIC indemnification assets and, if necessary, increase any loss share liability when necessary reductions exceed the current value of the FDIC indemnification assets. In accordance with the clawback provision noted above, the Company may be required to reimburse the FDIC when actual losses are less than certain thresholds established for each lose share agreement. The balance of these estimated reimbursements in accordance with clawback provisions and any related amortization are adjusted periodically for changes in the expected losses on covered assets.  On the Consolidated Statements of Condition, estimated reimbursements from clawback provisions are recorded as a reduction to the FDIC indemnification asset or, if necessary, an increase to the loss share liability, which is included within accrued interest payable and other liabilities. Although these assets are contractual receivables from the FDIC and these liabilities are contractual payables to the FDIC, there are no contractual interest rates. Additional expected losses, to the extent such expected losses result in recognition of an allowance for covered loan losses, will increase the FDIC indemnification asset or reduce the FDIC indemnification liability. The corresponding amortization is recorded as a component of non-interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

PCI Loans 
    
  Purchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. Expected future cash flows at the purchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable ( accretable yield ). The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference and represents probable losses in the portfolio. 
    
  In determining the acquisition date fair value of PCI loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Company aggregates these purchased loans into pools of loans by common risk characteristics, such as credit risk rating and loan type. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. 
    
  The Company purchased a portfolio of life insurance premium finance receivables in 2009. These purchased life insurance premium finance receivables are valued on an individual basis with the accretable component being recognized into interest income using the effective yield method over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The non-accretable portion is evaluated each quarter and if the loans  credit related conditions improve, a portion is transferred to the accretable component and accreted over future periods. In the event a specific loan prepays in whole, any remaining accretable and non-accretable discount is recognized in income immediately. If credit related conditions deteriorate, an allowance related to these loans will be established as part of the provision for credit losses. 
    
  See Note 6 Loans, for additional information on PCI loans. 

(4)   Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, non-interest bearing amounts due from correspondent banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements with original maturities of three months or less.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company transferred   $862.7 million   of investment securities with an unrealized loss of   $14.4 million   from the available-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification.   No   investment securities were transferred from the available-for-sale classification to the held-to-maturity classification in the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  The following table presents the portion of the Company s available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios which has gross unrealized losses, reflecting the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016  : 

The Company conducts a regular assessment of its investment securities to determine whether securities are other-than-temporarily impaired considering, among other factors, the nature of the securities, credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows, market conditions and the Company s ability to hold the securities through the anticipated recovery period. 
    
  The Company does not consider securities with unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016   to be other-than-temporarily impaired.   The   Company does not intend to sell these investments and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these investments before recovery of the amortized cost bases, which may be the maturity dates of the securities. The unrealized losses within each category have occurred as a result of changes in interest rates, market spreads and market conditions subsequent to purchase. Securities with continuous unrealized losses existing for more than twelve months were primarily corporate notes and mortgage-backed securities. Unrealized losses recognized on corporate notes and mortgage-backed securities are the result of increases in yields for similar types of securities.

The following table provides information as to the amount of gross gains and gross losses realized and proceeds received through the sale or call of investment securities: 

The amortized cost and fair value of securities as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , by contractual maturity, are shown in the following table. Contractual maturities may differ from actual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or repay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Mortgage-backed securities are not included in the maturity categories in the following maturity summary as actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the underlying mortgages may be called or prepaid without penalties: 

Securities having a fair value of   $1.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016   as well as securities having a fair value of    $1.2 billion   and   $1.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, were pledged as collateral for public deposits, trust deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances, securities sold under repurchase agreements and derivatives. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   securities of a single issuer, other than U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities, which exceeded   10%   of shareholders  equity.

(6)   Loans 
    
  The following table shows the Company s loan portfolio by category as of the dates shown: 

The Company s loan portfolio is generally comprised of loans to consumers and small to medium-sized businesses located within the geographic market areas that the banks serve. The premium finance receivables portfolios are made to customers throughout the United States and Canada. The Company strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type, industry, borrower and geographic concentrations. Such diversification reduces the exposure to economic downturns that may occur in different segments of the economy or in different industries. 
    
  Certain premium finance receivables are recorded net of unearned income. The unearned income portions of such premium finance receivables were   $64.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  ,   $56.7 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   $53.4 million   at   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Certain life insurance premium finance receivables attributable to the life insurance premium finance loan acquisition in 2009 as well as PCI loans are recorded net of credit discounts. See  Acquired Loan Information at Acquisition  below. 
    
  Total loans, excluding PCI loans, include net deferred loan fees and costs and fair value purchase accounting adjustments totaling   $873,000   at   September 30, 2016  ,   $(9.2) million   at   December 31, 2015   and   $(18.8) million   at   September 30, 2015  .  The net credit balance at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , is primarily the result of purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions in 2015. 
    
  It is the policy of the Company to review each prospective credit in order to determine the appropriateness and, when required, the adequacy of security or collateral necessary to obtain when making a loan. The type of collateral, when required, will vary from liquid assets to real estate. The Company seeks to ensure access to collateral, in the event of default, through adherence to state lending laws and the Company s credit monitoring procedures.

Acquired Loan Information at Acquisition PCI Loans 
    
  As part of the Company's previous acquisitions, the Company acquired loans for which there was evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination (PCI loans) and we determined that it was probable that the Company would be unable to collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. The following table presents the unpaid principal balance and carrying value for these acquired loans: 

The following table provides estimated details as of the date of acquisition on loans acquired in 2016 with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination: 

(1)      Represents undiscounted expected principal and interest cash at acquisition. 
    
  See Note 7 Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Impaired Loans for further discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses associated with PCI loans at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Accretable Yield Activity - PCI Loans 
    
  Changes in expected cash flows may vary from period to period as the Company periodically updates its cash flow model assumptions for PCI loans. The factors that most significantly affect the estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield, include changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products and changes in prepayment assumptions and loss estimates. The following table provides activity for the accretable yield of PCI loans: 

(1)   
    Represents the portion of the current period accreted yield, resulting from lower expected losses, applied to reduce the loss share indemnification asset or increase the loss share indemnification liability. 
              (2)   
    Reclassification is the result of subsequent increases in expected principal cash flows. 
              (3) 
    As of    September 30, 2016  , the Company estimates that the remaining accretable yield balance to be amortized to the indemnification asset or liability for the bank     acquisitions is   $1.5 million  . The remainder of the accretable yield related to bank acquisitions is expected to be amortized to interest income.

Accretion to interest income accounted for under ASC 310-30 totaled   $6.4 million   and   $5.9 million   in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended Septemebr 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded accretion to interest income of   $17.1 million   and   $18.4 million  , respectively. These amounts include accretion from both covered and non-covered loans, and are both included within interest and fees on loans in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company's ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on our ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which our credit management personnel assign a credit risk rating (1 to 10 rating) to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis. 
    
  Each loan officer is responsible for monitoring his or her loan portfolio, recommending a credit risk rating for each loan in his or her portfolio and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then ratified by the bank s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including: a borrower s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. 
    
  The Company s Problem Loan Reporting system automatically includes all loans with credit risk ratings of 6 through 9. This system is designed to provide an on-going detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan. Once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of 6 or worse, the Company s Managed Asset Division performs an overall credit and collateral review. As part of this review, all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked. As a result of this initial review by the Company s Managed Asset Division, the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible or an impairment reserve may be established. The Company s impairment analysis utilizes an independent re-appraisal of the collateral (unless such a third-party evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral, such as a closely-held business or thinly traded securities). In the case of commercial real estate collateral, an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the Company s Real Estate Services Group to determine if there has been any change in the underlying collateral value. These independent appraisals are reviewed by the Real Estate Services Group and sometimes by independent third party valuation experts and may be adjusted depending upon market conditions. 
    
  Through the credit risk rating process, loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status, a charge-off or the establishment of a specific impairment reserve. If we determine that a loan amount, or portion thereof, is uncollectible, the loan s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded to an 8 or 9 and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. Any loan that has a partial charge-off continues to be assigned a credit risk rating of an 8 or 9 for the duration of time that a balance remains outstanding. The Company undertakes a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the credit to minimize actual losses. 
    
  If, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a specific impairment reserve is established. In determining the appropriate charge-off for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral.

Non-performing loans include all non-accrual loans (8 and 9 risk ratings) as well as loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest, excluding PCI and covered loans. The remainder of the portfolio is considered performing under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The following table presents the recorded investment based on performance of loans by class, excluding covered loans, per the most recent analysis at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  :

A summary of activity in the allowance for covered loan losses for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 is as follows: 

In conjunction with FDIC-assisted transactions, the Company entered into loss share agreements with the FDIC. Additional expected losses, to the extent such expected losses result in the recognition of an allowance for loan losses, will increase the FDIC loss share asset or reduce any FDIC loss share liability. The allowance for loan losses for loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions is determined without giving consideration to the amounts recoverable through loss share agreements (since the loss share agreements are separately accounted for and thus presented  gross  on the balance sheet). On the Consolidated Statements of Income, the provision for credit losses is reported net of changes in the amount recoverable under the loss share agreements. Reductions to expected losses, to the extent such reductions to expected losses are the result of an improvement to the actual or expected cash flows from the covered assets, will reduce  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

the FDIC loss share asset or increase any FDIC loss share liability. Additions to expected losses will require an increase to the allowance for covered loan losses, and a corresponding increase to the FDIC loss share asset or reduction to any FDIC loss share liability. See  FDIC-Assisted Transactions  within Note 3   Business Combinations for more detail. 
    
  Impaired Loans 
    
  A summary of impaired loans, including troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"), is as follows: 

(1) 
    These impaired loans require an allowance for loan losses because the estimated fair value of the loans or related collateral is less than the recorded investment in the loans. 
              (2) 
    Impaired loans are considered by the Company to be non-accrual loans, TDRs or loans with principal and/or interest at risk, even if the     loan is current with all payments of principal and interest. 
       
  The following tables present impaired loans by loan class, excluding covered loans, for the periods ended as follows:

TDRs 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $44.3 million   in loans modified in TDRs. The   $44.3 million   in TDRs represents   89   credits in which economic concessions were granted to certain borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay. 
    
  The Company s approach to restructuring loans, excluding PCI loans, is built on its credit risk rating system which requires credit management personnel to assign a credit risk rating to each loan. In each case, the loan officer is responsible for recommending a credit risk rating for each loan and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then reviewed and approved by the bank s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including a borrower s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. The Company s credit risk rating scale is one through ten with higher scores indicating higher risk. In the case of loans rated six or worse following modification, the Company s Managed Assets Division evaluates the loan and the credit risk rating and determines that the loan has been restructured to be reasonably assured of repayment and of performance according to the modified terms and is supported by a current, well-documented credit assessment of the borrower s financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms. 
    
  A modification of a loan, excluding PCI loans, with an existing credit risk rating of 6 or worse or a modification of any other credit, which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of six or worse, must be reviewed for possible TDR classification. In that event, our Managed Assets Division conducts an overall credit and collateral review. A modification of these loans is considered to be a TDR if both (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) for economic or legal reasons, the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The modification of a loan, excluding PCI loans, where the credit risk rating is 5 or better both before and after such modification is not considered to be a TDR. Based on the Company s credit risk rating system, it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is 5 or better are not experiencing financial difficulties and therefore, are not considered TDRs. 
    
  All credits determined to be a TDR will continue to be classified as a TDR in all subsequent periods, unless the borrower has been in compliance with the loan s modified terms for a period of six months (including over a calendar year-end) and the current interest rate represents a market rate at the time of restructuring. The Managed Assets Division, in consultation with the respective loan officer, determines whether the modified interest rate represented a current market rate at the time of restructuring. Using knowledge of current market conditions and rates, competitive pricing on recent loan originations, and an assessment of various characteristics of the modified loan (including collateral position and payment history), an appropriate market rate for a new borrower with similar risk is determined. If the modified interest rate meets or exceeds this market rate for a new borrower with similar risk, the modified interest rate represents a market rate at the time of restructuring. Additionally, before removing a loan from TDR classification, a review of the current or previously measured impairment on the loan and any concerns related to future performance by the borrower is conducted. If concerns exist about the future ability of the borrower to meet its obligations under the loans based on a credit review by the Managed Assets Division, the TDR classification is not removed from the loan. 
    
  TDRs are reviewed at the time of the modification and on a quarterly basis to determine if a specific reserve is necessary.  The carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan's original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral.  Any shortfall is recorded as a specific reserve.  The Company, in accordance with ASC 310-10, continues to individually measure impairment of these loans after the TDR classification is removed. 
    
  Each TDR was reviewed for impairment at   September 30, 2016   and approximately   $2.8 million   of impairment was present and appropriately reserved for through the Company s normal reserving methodology in the Company s allowance for loan losses. For TDRs in which impairment is calculated by the present value of future cash flows, the Company records interest income representing the decrease in impairment resulting from the passage of time during the respective period, which differs from interest income from contractually required interest on these specific loans.  During both the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company recorded   $98,000   interest income representing this decrease in impairment. For the   nine months ended      September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company recorded   $323,000   and   $385,000  , respectively, in interest income.  
    
  TDRs may arise in which, due to financial difficulties experienced by the borrower, the Company obtains through physical possession one or more collateral assets in satisfaction of all or part of an existing credit. Once possession is obtained, the Company reclassifies the appropriate portion of the remaining balance of the credit from loans to OREO, which is included within other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. For any residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, the Company is considered to possess the related collateral only if legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure, or the borrower conveys all interest in the residential real estate property to the Company through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar legal agreement. Excluding covered OREO, at   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $11.7 million   of foreclosed residential real estate properties included within OREO.

    Balances represent the recorded investment in the loan at the time of the restructuring. 
       
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   two   loans totaling   $71,000   were determined to be TDRs, compared to   one   loan totaling   $222,000   in the same period of 2015. Of these loans extended at below market terms, the weighted average extension had a term of approximately   22   months during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   214   months for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Further, the weighted average decrease in the stated interest rate for loans with a reduction of interest rate during the period was approximately   150 basis points   and   338 basis points   during the three months ending   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Additionally,   no   principal balances were forgiven in the   third quarter of 2016   or   2015  .

  Notes Payable 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , notes payable represented a   $56.2 million   term facility ("Term Facility"), which is part of a   $150.0 million   loan agreement ("Credit Agreement") with unaffiliated banks dated   December 15, 2014  . The Credit Agreement consists of the Term Facility with an original outstanding balance of   $75.0 million   and a   $75.0 million   revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Facility"). At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a balance of   $56.2 million   compared to   $67.4 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   $71.3 million   at   September 30, 2015   under the Term Facility. The Term Facility is stated at par of the current outstanding balance of the debt adjusted for unamortized costs paid by the Company in relation to the debt issuance. The Company was contractually required to borrow the entire amount of the Term Facility on   June 15, 2015   and all such borrowings must be repaid by   June 15, 2020  . Beginning   September 30, 2015  , the Company was required to make straight-line   quarterly   amortizing payments on the Term Facility. At   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company had   no   outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility. As no outstanding balance exists on the Revolving Credit Facility, unamortized costs paid by the Company in relation to the issuance of this debt are classified in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. In   December 2015  , the Company amended the Credit Agreement, effectively extending the maturity date on the Revolving Credit Facility from   December 14, 2015   to   December 12, 2016  .  
    
  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement that are considered  Base Rate Loans  bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (1)   50 basis points   (in the case of a borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility) or   75 basis points   (in the case of a borrowing under the Term Facility) plus (2) the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus   50 basis points  , (b) the lender's prime rate, and (c) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined below) that would be applicable for an interest period of one month plus   100 basis points  . Borrowings under the agreement that are considered  Eurodollar Rate Loans  bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (1)   150 basis points   (in the case of a borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility) or   175 basis points   (in the case of a borrowing under the Term Facility) plus (2) the LIBOR rate for the applicable period, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities (the  Eurodollar Rate ). A commitment fee is payable   quarterly   equal to   0.20%   of the actual daily amount by which the lenders' commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeded the amount outstanding under such facility. 
    
  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by pledges of and first priority perfected security interests in the Company's equity interest in its bank subsidiaries and contain several restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of various capital adequacy levels, asset quality and profitability ratios, and certain restrictions on dividends and other indebtedness. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Facility are available to be utilized, as needed, to provide capital to fund continued growth at the Company s banks and to serve as an interim source of funds for acquisitions, common stock repurchases or other general corporate purposes. 
    
  Short-term Borrowings 
    
  Short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased. These borrowings totaled   $33.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $63.9 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   $57.6 million   at   September 30, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , securities sold under repurchase agreements represent   $33.2 million  ,   $58.9 million   and   $57.6 million  , respectively, of customer sweep accounts in connection with master repurchase agreements at the banks. The Company records securities sold under repurchase agreements at their gross value and does not offset positions on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had pledged securities related to its customer balances in sweep accounts of   $44.1 million  . Securities pledged for customer balances in sweep accounts and short-term borrowings from brokers are maintained under the Company s control and consist of U.S. Government agency, mortgage-backed and corporate securities.  These securities are included in the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios as reflected on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Condition.

The following is a summary of these securities pledged as of   September 30, 2016   disaggregated by investment category and maturity, and reconciled to the outstanding balance of securities sold under repurchase agreements: 

Other Borrowings 
    
  Other borrowings at   September 30, 2016   represent a fixed-rate promissory note issued by the Company in   August 2012   ("Fixed-Rate Promissory Note") related to and secured by an office building owned by the Company, and non-recourse notes issued by the Company to other banks related to certain capital leases. At   September 30, 2016  , the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note had a balance of   $17.8 million   compared to a balance of   $18.2 million   and   $18.3 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Under the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note, the Company will make   monthly   principal payments and pay interest at a fixed rate of   3.75%   until maturity on   September 1, 2017  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the non-recourse notes related to certain capital leases totaled   $519,000   and   $732,000  , respectively. 
    
  Secured Borrowings 
    
  Secured borrowings at   September 30, 2016   primarily represents transactions to sell an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to the Company's subsidiary, FIFC Canada. In December 2014, FIFC Canada sold such interest to an unrelated third party in exchange for a cash payment of approximately   C$150 million   pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement ( Receivables Purchase Agreement ). The Receivables Purchase Agreement was amended in December 2015, effectively extending the maturity date from   December 15, 2015   to   December 15, 2017  . Additionally, at that time, the unrelated third party paid an additional   C$10 million  , which increased the total payments to   C$160 million  . These transactions were not considered sales of receivables and, as such, related proceeds received are reflected on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Condition as a secured borrowing owed to the unrelated third party, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and translated to the Company s reporting currency as of the respective date. At   September 30, 2016  , the translated balance of the secured borrowing totaled   $121.9 million   compared to   $115.5 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   $112.6 million   at   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, the interest rate under the Receivables Purchase Agreement at   September 30, 2016   was   1.6121%  . 
    
  Subordinated Notes 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding subordinated notes totaling   $138.9 million   compared to   $138.9 million   and   $138.8 million   outstanding at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The notes have a stated interest rate of   5.00%   and mature in   June 2024  . These notes are stated at par adjusted for unamortized costs paid related to the issuance of this debt. 

(11)   Junior Subordinated Debentures 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   100%   of the common securities of   eleven   trusts, Wintrust Capital Trust III, Wintrust Statutory Trust IV, Wintrust Statutory Trust V, Wintrust Capital Trust VII, Wintrust Capital Trust VIII, Wintrust Capital Trust IX, Northview Capital Trust I, Town Bankshares Capital Trust I, First Northwest Capital Trust I, Suburban Illinois Capital Trust II, and Community Financial Shares Statutory Trust II (the  Trusts ) set up to provide long-term financing. The Northview, Town, First Northwest, Suburban, and Community Financial Shares capital trusts were acquired as part of the acquisitions of Northview Financial Corporation, Town Bankshares, Ltd., First Northwest Bancorp, Inc., Suburban and CFIS, respectively. The Trusts were formed for purposes of issuing trust preferred securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and common securities solely in junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company (or assumed by the Company in connection with an acquisition), with the same maturities and interest rates as the trust preferred  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

securities. The junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of the Trusts. In each Trust, the common securities represent approximately   3%   of the junior subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities represent approximately   97%   of the junior subordinated debentures. 
    
  In January 2016, the Company acquired   $15.0 million   of the   $40.0 million   of trust preferred securities issued by Wintrust Capital Trust VIII from a third-party investor. The purchase effectively extinguished   $15.0 million   of junior subordinated debentures related to Wintrust Capital Trust VIII and resulted in a   $4.3 million   gain from the early extinguishment of debt. 
    
  The Trusts are reported in the Company s consolidated financial statements as unconsolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, in the Consolidated Statements of Condition, the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company to the Trusts are reported as liabilities and the common securities of the Trusts, all of which are owned by the Company, are included in available-for-sale securities. 
    
  The following table provides a summary of the Company s junior subordinated debentures as of   September 30, 2016  . The junior subordinated debentures represent the par value of the obligations owed to the Trusts. 

The junior subordinated debentures totaled   $253.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $268.6 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The interest rates on the variable rate junior subordinated debentures are based on the three-month LIBOR rate and reset on a quarterly basis. At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average contractual interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures was   3.02%  . The Company entered into interest rate swaps and caps to hedge the variable cash flows on certain junior subordinated debentures. The hedge-adjusted rate on the junior subordinated debentures as of   September 30, 2016  , was   3.71%  . Distributions on the common and preferred securities issued by the Trusts are payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the interest rates being earned by the Trusts on the junior subordinated debentures. Interest expense on the junior subordinated debentures is deductible for income tax purposes. 
    
  The Company has guaranteed the payment of distributions and payments upon liquidation or redemption of the trust preferred securities, in each case to the extent of funds held by the Trusts. The Company and the Trusts believe that, taken together, the obligations of the Company under the guarantees, the junior subordinated debentures, and other related agreements provide, in the aggregate, a full, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee, on a subordinated basis, of all of the obligations of the Trusts under the trust preferred securities. Subject to certain limitations, the Company has the right to defer the payment of interest on the junior subordinated debentures at any time, or from time to time, for a period not to exceed   20   consecutive quarters. The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption. The junior subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or in part prior to maturity at any time after the earliest redemption dates shown in the table, and earlier at the discretion of the Company if certain conditions are met, and, in any event, only after the Company has obtained Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") approval, if then required under applicable guidelines or regulations. 
    
  Prior to January 1, 2015, the junior subordinated debentures, subject to certain limitations, qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital of the Company and the amount in excess of those certain limitations could, subject to other restrictions, be included in Tier 2 capital. Starting in 2015, a portion of these junior subordinated debentures still qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital of the Company and the amount in excess of those certain limitations, subject to certain restrictions, was included in Tier 2 capital. At   December 31,

     Table of Contents  

2015  ,   $65.1 million   and   $195.4 million   of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, were included in the Company's Tier 1 and Tier 2 regulatory capital, respectively. Starting in 2016,   none   of the junior subordinated debentures qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital of the Company resulting in   $245.5 million   of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, being included in the Company's Tier 2 regulatory capital. 

(12)   Segment Information 
    
  The Company s operations consist of   three   primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. 
    
  The   three   reportable segments are strategic business units that are separately managed as they offer different products and services and have different marketing strategies. In addition, each segment s customer base has varying characteristics and each segment has a different regulatory environment. While the Company s management monitors each of the   fifteen   bank subsidiaries  operations and profitability separately, these subsidiaries have been aggregated into   one   reportable operating segment due to the similarities in products and services, customer base, operations, profitability measures, and economic characteristics. 
    
  For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances.  Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment. Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment. See Note 9   Deposits, for more information on these deposits.  Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment's risk-weighted assets.   
    
  The segment financial information provided in the following tables has been derived from the internal profitability reporting system used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the Company. The accounting policies of the segments are substantially similar to those described in  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in Note 1 of the Company s   2015   Form 10-K. The Company evaluates segment performance based on after-tax profit or loss and other appropriate profitability measures common to each segment.

(13)   Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company primarily enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its strategy to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivative instruments represent contracts between parties that result in one party delivering cash to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying term (such as a rate, security price or price index) specified in the contract. The amount of cash delivered from one party to the other is determined based on the interaction of the notional amount of the contract with the underlying term. Derivatives are also implicit in certain contracts and commitments. 
    
  The derivative financial instruments currently used by the Company to manage its exposure to interest rate risk include: (1) interest rate swaps and caps to manage the interest rate risk of certain fixed and variable rate assets and variable rate liabilities; (2) interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market; (3) forward commitments for the future delivery of such mortgage loans to protect the Company from adverse changes in interest rates and corresponding changes in the value of mortgage loans held-for-sale; and (4) covered call options to economically hedge specific investment securities and receive fee income effectively enhancing the overall yield on such securities to compensate for net interest margin compression. The Company also enters into derivatives (typically interest rate swaps) with certain qualified borrowers to facilitate the borrowers  risk management strategies and concurrently enters into mirror-image derivatives with a third party counterparty, effectively making a market in the derivatives for such borrowers. Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency denominated assets. 
    
  The Company has purchased interest rate cap derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures.  Certain interest rate cap derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedge derivatives of the variable cash outflows associated with interest expense on the Company s junior subordinated debentures and certain deposits.  Other cap derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting but are economic hedges of the Company's overall portfolio, therefore any mark to market changes in the value of these caps are recognized in earnings.   
    
  Below is a summary of the interest rate cap derivatives held by the Company as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The Company recognizes derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. The Company records derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition within accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued interest payable and other liabilities, respectively. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in income or in shareholders  equity as a component of other comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting and, if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge. Generally, changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in income in the same period and in the same income statement line as changes in the fair values of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk(s). Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective hedges, are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, and reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship pursuant to ASC 815, including changes in fair value related to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges, are reported in non-interest income during the period of the change. Derivative financial instruments are valued by a third party and are corroborated through comparison with valuations provided by the respective counterparties. Fair values of certain mortgage banking derivatives (interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments to sell mortgage loans) are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the loan commitment. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives is computed based on changes in foreign currency rates stated in the contract compared to those prevailing at the measurement date.

The table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  : 

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to net interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of payments at the end of each period in which the interest rate specified in the contract exceeds the agreed upon strike price.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   two   interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate deposits.  The interest rate swap derivatives had notional amounts of   $250.0 million   and   $275.0 million  , and mature in July 2019 and August 2019, respectively. Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   one   interest rate swap and   two   interest rate caps designated as hedges of the variable cash outflows associated with interest expense on the Company s junior subordinated debentures.  The swap derivative associated with the Company's junior subordinated debentures had a notional amount of   $25.0 million  , and matures in October 2016. The cap derivatives associated with the Company's junior subordinated debentures had notional amounts of   $50.0 million   and   $40.0 million  , respectively, both maturing in September 2017. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable rate junior subordinated debentures. The changes in fair value (net of tax) are separately disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognized directly in earnings; however,   no   hedge ineffectiveness was recognized during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   September 30, 2015  . The Company uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess and measure hedge effectiveness.

The table below provides details on each of these cash flow hedges as of   September 30, 2016  : 

A rollforward of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimates that during the next twelve months,   $1.7 million   will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an increase to interest expense. 
    
  Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has   seven   interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of   $71.3 million   that were designated as fair value hedges associated with fixed rate commercial and industrial and commercial franchise loans as well as life insurance premium finance receivables.   
    
  For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. The Company includes the gain or loss on the hedged item in the same line item as the offsetting loss or gain on the related derivatives.  The Company recognized a net gain of   $35,000   in other income related to hedge ineffectiveness for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and a   $21,000   net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a year-to-date basis, the Company recognized a net gain of   $13,000   and a net loss of   $23,000   for the nine months ending   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  On June 1, 2013, the Company de-designated a   $96.5 million   notional amount cap which was previously designated as a fair value hedge of interest rate risk associated with an embedded cap in one of the Company s floating rate loans. The hedged loan was restructured which resulted in the interest rate cap no longer qualifying as an effective fair value hedge.  As such, the interest rate cap derivative is no longer accounted for under hedge accounting and all changes in the interest rate cap derivative value subsequent to June 1, 2013 are recorded in earnings.

The following table presents the gain/(loss) and hedge ineffectiveness recognized on derivative instruments and the related hedged items that are designated as a fair value hedge accounting relationship as of   September 30, 2016   and 2015: 

Non-Designated Hedges 
    
  The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are used to manage the Company s economic exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of ASC 815. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings. 
    
  Interest Rate Derivatives   The Company has interest rate derivatives, including swaps and option products, resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified borrowers. The Company s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products (typically interest rate swaps) directly with qualified commercial borrowers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. For example, these arrangements allow the Company s commercial borrowers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. In order to minimize the Company s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions  changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in non-interest income. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of approximately   $4.1 billion   (all interest rate swaps and caps with customers and third parties) related to this program. These interest rate derivatives had maturity dates ranging from   October 2016   to   February 2045  . 
    
  Mortgage Banking Derivatives   These derivatives include interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of such loans. It is the Company s practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of a portion of our residential mortgage loan production when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of future changes in interest rates on its commitments to fund the loans as well as on its portfolio of mortgage loans held-for-sale. The Company s mortgage banking derivatives have not been designated as being in accounting hedge relationships. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had forward commitments to sell mortgage loans with an aggregate notional amount of approximately   $1.3 billion   and interest rate lock commitments with an aggregate notional amount of approximately   $683.6 million  .  The fair values of these derivatives were estimated based on changes in mortgage rates from the dates of the commitments. Changes in the fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives are included in mortgage banking revenue. 
    
  Foreign Currency Derivatives   These derivatives include foreign currency contracts used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and to facilitate the respective risk management strategies of certain customer's foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar-equivalent value of the foreign currency denominated assets or forecasted transactions increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency denominated assets or forecasted transactions are expected to substantially offset this variability. For certain foreign currency contracts with customers, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. These offsetting

     Table of Contents  

derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions  changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. As of   September 30, 2016   the Company held foreign currency derivatives with an aggregate notional amount of approximately   $63.6 million  .  
    
  Other Derivatives   Periodically, the Company will sell options to a bank or dealer for the right to purchase certain securities held within the banks  investment portfolios (covered call options). These option transactions are designed primarily to mitigate overall interest rate risk and to increase the total return associated with the investment securities portfolio. These options do not qualify as accounting hedges pursuant to ASC 815, and, accordingly, changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized as other non-interest income.  There were   no   covered call options outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   or   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  As discussed above, the Company has entered into interest rate cap derivatives to protect the Company in a rising rate environment against increased margin compression due to the repricing of variable rate liabilities and lack of repricing of fixed rate loans and/or securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   two   interest rate cap derivative contracts, which are not designated in accounting hedge relationships, with an aggregate notional value of   $175.0 million  .  
    
  Amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to derivative instruments not designated in accounting hedge relationships were as follows: 

Credit Risk 
    
  Derivative instruments have inherent risks, primarily market risk and credit risk. Market risk is associated with changes in interest rates and credit risk relates to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms of the agreement. The amounts potentially subject to market  and credit risks are the streams of interest payments under the contracts and the market value of the derivative instrument and not the notional principal amounts used to express the volume of the transactions. Market and credit risks are managed and monitored as part of the Company's overall asset-liability management process, except that the credit risk related to derivatives entered into with certain qualified borrowers is managed through the Company's standard loan underwriting process since these derivatives are secured through collateral provided by the loan agreements. Actual exposures are monitored against various types of credit limits established to contain risk within parameters. When deemed necessary, appropriate types and amounts of collateral are obtained to minimize credit exposure. 
    
  The Company has agreements with certain of its interest rate derivative counterparties that contain cross-default provisions, which provide that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision allowing the counterparty to terminate the derivative positions if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well or adequately capitalized institution, which would require the Company to settle its obligations under the agreements. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of interest rate derivatives in a net liability position that were subject to such agreements, which includes accrued interest related to these agreements, was   $80.6 million  .  If at   September 30, 2016   the Company had breached any of these provisions and the derivative positions were terminated as a result, the Company would have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value and would have been required to pay any additional amounts due in excess of amounts previously posted as collateral with the respective counterparty. 
    
  The Company is also exposed to the credit risk of its commercial borrowers who are counterparties to interest rate derivatives with the banks. This counterparty risk related to the commercial borrowers is managed and monitored through the banks' standard underwriting process applicable to loans since these derivatives are secured through collateral provided by the loan agreement. The counterparty risk associated with the mirror-image swaps executed with third parties is monitored and managed in connection with the Company's overall asset liability management process.

The Company records interest rate derivatives subject to master netting agreements at their gross value and does not offset derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition.  The tables below summarize the Company's interest rate derivatives and offsetting positions as of the dates shown. 

(1) 
    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company posted collateral of     $86.0 million   and   $45.5 million  , respectively, which resulted in excess collateral with its counterparties.  For purposes of this disclosure, the amount of posted collateral is limited to the amount offsetting the derivative liability. 

(14)   Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The Company measures, monitors and discloses certain of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. These financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the observability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: 

Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2     inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s own assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
       
  A financial instrument s categorization within the above valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the assets or liabilities. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
    
  Available-for-sale and trading account securities   Fair values for available-for-sale and trading securities are typically based on prices obtained from independent pricing vendors. Securities measured with these valuation techniques are generally classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Typically, standard inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades for similar securities, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications are used to fair value a security. When these inputs are not available, broker/dealer quotes may be obtained by the vendor to determine the fair value of the security. We review the vendor s pricing methodologies to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market due to limited activity or a less liquid market are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The Company s Investment Operations Department is responsible for the valuation of Level 3 available-for-sale securities. The methodology and variables used as inputs in pricing Level 3 securities are derived from a combination of observable and  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

unobservable inputs. The unobservable inputs are determined through internal assumptions that may vary from period to period due to external factors, such as market movement and credit rating adjustments. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company classified   $67.2 million   of municipal securities as Level 3. These municipal securities are bond issues for various municipal government entities primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin and are privately placed, non-rated bonds without CUSIP numbers. The Company s methodology for pricing the non-rated bonds focuses on three distinct inputs: equivalent rating, yield and other pricing terms. To determine the rating for a given non-rated municipal bond, the Investment Operations Department references a publicly issued bond by the same issuer if available. A reduction is then applied to the rating obtained from the comparable bond, as the Company believes if liquidated, a non-rated bond would be valued less than a similar bond with a verifiable rating. The reduction applied by the Company is one complete rating grade (i.e. a  AA  rating for a comparable bond would be reduced to  A  for the Company s valuation). In the   third quarter   of 2016, all of the ratings derived in the above process by Investment Operations were BBB or better, for both bonds with and without comparable bond proxies. The fair value measurement of municipal bonds is sensitive to the rating input, as a higher rating typically results in an increased valuation. The remaining pricing inputs used in the bond valuation are observable. Based on the rating determined in the above process, Investment Operations obtains a corresponding current market yield curve available to market participants. Other terms including coupon, maturity date, redemption price, number of coupon payments per year, and accrual method are obtained from the individual bond term sheets. Certain municipal bonds held by the Company at   September 30, 2016   have a call date that has passed, and are now continuously callable. When valuing these bonds, the fair value is capped at par value as the Company assumes a market participant would not pay more than par for a continuously callable bond. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   no   equity securities classified as Level 3 compared to   $25.2 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   $24.5 million   at   September 30, 2015  . In the prior periods, the securities in Level 3 were primarily comprised of auction rate preferred securities. The Company s valuation methodology at that time included modeling the contractual cash flows of the underlying preferred securities and applying a discount to these cash flows by a market spread derived from the market price of the securities underlying debt. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company exchanged these auction rate securities for the underlying preferred securities, resulting in a   $2.4 million   gain on the nonmonetary sale. The Company classified the preferred securities received as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy at the time of the transaction due to observable inputs other than quoted prices existing for the preferred securities. 
    
  Mortgage loans held-for-sale   The fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale is determined by reference to investor price sheets for loan products with similar characteristics. 
    
  Mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs")   Fair value for MSRs is determined utilizing a valuation model which calculates the fair value of each servicing rights based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company uses a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with each servicing rights, given current market conditions. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company classified   $13.9 million   of MSRs as Level 3. The weighted average discount rate used as an input to value the MSRs at   September 30, 2016   was   5.52%   with discount rates applied ranging from   3%  -  7%  . The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. Additionally, fair value estimates include assumptions about prepayment speeds which ranged from   2%  -  85%   or a weighted average prepayment speed of   14.73%   used as an input to value the MSRs at   September 30, 2016  . Prepayment speeds are inversely related to the fair value of MSRs as an increase in prepayment speeds results in a decreased valuation. 
    
  Derivative instruments   The Company s derivative instruments include interest rate swaps and caps, commitments to fund mortgages for sale into the secondary market (interest rate locks), forward commitments to end investors for the sale of mortgage loans and foreign currency contracts. Interest rate swaps and caps are valued by a third party, using models that primarily use market observable inputs, such as yield curves, and are corroborated by comparison with valuations provided by the respective counterparties. The credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements is measured on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. The fair value for mortgage-related derivatives is based on changes in mortgage rates from the date of the commitments. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives is computed based on change in foreign currency rates stated in the contract compared to those prevailing at the measurement date. 
    
  Nonqualified deferred compensation assets   The underlying assets relating to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are included in a trust and primarily consist of non-exchange traded institutional funds which are priced based by an independent third party service.

The aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015   for mortgage loans held-for-sale measured at fair value under ASC 825 was   $537.0 million  ,   $372.0 million   and   $328.1 million  , respectively, while the aggregate fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale was   $559.6 million  ,   $388.0 million   and   $347.0 million  , for the same respective periods, as shown in the above tables. There were   no   nonaccrual loans or loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing in the mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio measured at fair value as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  .

  Also, the Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from impairment charges on individual assets. For assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that were still held in the balance sheet at the end of the period, the following table provides the carrying value of the related individual assets or portfolios at   September 30, 2016  .

    Fair value losses recognized, net on other real estate owned include valuation adjustments and charge-offs during the respective period. 
       
  Impaired loans   A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. A loan modified in a TDR is an impaired loan according to applicable accounting guidance. Impairment is measured by estimating the fair value of the loan based on the present value of expected cash flows, the market price of the loan, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Impaired loans are considered a fair value measurement where an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral. Appraised values, which may require adjustments to market-based valuation inputs, are generally used on real estate collateral-dependent impaired loans. 
    
  The Company s Managed Assets Division is primarily responsible for the valuation of Level 3 inputs of impaired loans. For more information on the Managed Assets Division review of impaired loans refer to Note 7   Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Impaired Loans. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $90.5 million   of impaired loans classified as Level 3. Of the   $90.5 million   of impaired loans,   $64.6 million   were measured at fair value based on the underlying collateral of the loan as shown in the table above. The remaining   $25.9 million   were valued based on discounted cash flows in accordance with ASC 310. 
    
  Other real estate owned (including covered other real estate owned)   Other real estate owned is comprised of real estate acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans and is included in other assets. Other real estate owned is recorded at its estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer, with any excess of the related loan balance over the fair value less expected selling costs charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent changes in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses upon sale, if any, are also charged to other non-interest expense. Fair value is generally based on third party appraisals and internal estimates that are adjusted by a discount representing the estimated cost of sale and is therefore considered a Level 3 valuation. 
    
  The Company s Managed Assets Division is primarily responsible for the valuation of Level 3 inputs for non-covered other real estate owned and covered other real estate owned. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $45.4 million   of other real estate owned classified as Level 3. The unobservable input applied to other real estate owned relates to the   10%   reduction to the appraisal

value representing the estimated cost of sale of the foreclosed property. A higher discount for the estimated cost of sale results in a decreased carrying value. 
    
  The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used to measure both recurring and non-recurring Level 3 fair value measurements at   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

     Table of Contents  

The Company is required under applicable accounting guidance to report the fair value of all financial instruments on the consolidated statements of condition, including those financial instruments carried at cost. The table below presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments as of the dates shown: 

Not all the financial instruments listed in the table above are subject to the disclosure provisions of ASC Topic 820, as certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing deposits with banks, brokerage customer receivables, FHLB and FRB stock, FDIC indemnification asset and liability, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable and non-maturity deposits. 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments that were not previously disclosed. 
    
  Held-to-maturity securities.   Held-to-maturity securities include U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities and municipal bonds issued by various municipal government entities primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin. Fair values for held-to-maturity securities are typically based on prices obtained from independent pricing vendors. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized held-to-maturity securities as a Level 2 fair value measurement. 
    
  Loans.   Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are analyzed by type such as commercial, residential real estate, etc. Each category is further segmented by interest rate type (fixed and variable) and term. For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently, estimated fair values are based on carrying values. The fair value of residential loans is based on secondary market sources for securities backed by similar loans, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. The fair value for other fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect credit and interest rate risks inherent in the loan. The primary impact of credit risk on the present value of the loan portfolio, however, was assessed through the use of the allowance for loan losses, which is believed to represent  
  
   47 

     Table of Contents  

the current fair value of probable incurred losses for purposes of the fair value calculation. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized loans as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
    
  Deposits with stated maturities.   The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently in effect for deposits of similar remaining maturities. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized deposits with stated maturities as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
    
  FHLB advances.   The fair value of FHLB advances is obtained from the FHLB which uses a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market rates of similar maturity debt securities to discount cash flows. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized FHLB advances as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
    
  Subordinated notes.   The fair value of the subordinated notes is based on a market price obtained from an independent pricing vendor. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized subordinated notes as a Level 2 fair value measurement. 
    
  Junior subordinated debentures.   The fair value of the junior subordinated debentures is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized junior subordinated debentures as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 

(15)   Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
    
  In May 2015, the Company s shareholders approved the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan ( the 2015 Plan ) which provides for the issuance of up to   5,485,000   shares of common stock. The 2015 Plan replaced the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan ( the 2007 Plan ) which replaced the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan ( the 1997 Plan ). The 2015 Plan, the 2007 Plan and the 1997 Plan are collectively referred to as  the Plans.   The 2015 Plan has substantially similar terms to the 2007 Plan and the 1997 Plan. Outstanding awards under the Plans for which common shares are not issued by reason of cancellation, forfeiture, lapse of such award or settlement of such award in cash, are again available under the 2015 Plan. All grants made after the approval of the 2015 Plan will be made pursuant to the 2015 Plan. The Plans cover substantially all employees of Wintrust. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers all stock-based compensation programs and authorizes all awards granted pursuant to the Plans. 
    
  The Plans permit the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted share or unit awards, performance awards and other incentive awards valued in whole or in part by reference to the Company s common stock, all on a stand alone, combination or tandem basis. The Company historically awarded stock-based compensation in the form of time-vested non-qualified stock options and time-vested restricted share unit awards ( restricted shares ). The grants of options provide for the purchase of shares of the Company s common stock at the fair market value of the stock on the date the options are granted. Stock options under the 2015 Plan and the 2007 Plan generally vest ratably over periods of   three   to   five   years and have a maximum term of   seven   years from the date of grant. Stock options granted under the 1997 Plan provided for a maximum term of   10   years. Restricted shares entitle the holders to receive, at no cost, shares of the Company s common stock. Restricted shares generally vest over periods of   one   to   five   years from the date of grant. 
    
  Beginning in 2011, the Company has awarded annual grants under the Long-Term Incentive Program ( LTIP ), which is administered under the Plans. The LTIP is designed in part to align the interests of management with the interests of shareholders, foster retention, create a long-term focus based on sustainable results and provide participants with a target long-term incentive opportunity. It is anticipated that LTIP awards will continue to be granted annually. LTIP grants to date have consisted of time-vested non-qualified stock options and performance-based stock and cash awards. Performance-based stock and cash awards granted under the LTIP are contingent upon the achievement of pre-established long-term performance goals set in advance by the Compensation Committee over a three-year period starting at the beginning of each calendar year.  These performance awards are granted at a target level, and based on the Company s achievement of the pre-established long-term goals, the actual payouts can range from   0%   to a maximum of   150%   (for awards granted in 2015 and 2016) or   200%   (for awards granted prior to 2015) of the target award. The awards vest in the quarter after the end of the performance period upon certification of the payout by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  
    
  Holders of restricted share awards and performance-based stock awards received under the Plans are not entitled to vote or receive cash dividends (or cash payments equal to the cash dividends) on the underlying common shares until the awards are vested and issued. Except in limited circumstances, these awards are canceled upon termination of employment without any payment of consideration by the Company.  Shares that are vested but not issuable pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements accrue additional shares based on the value of dividends otherwise paid.

Stock-based compensation is measured as the fair value of an award on the date of grant, and the measured cost is recognized over the period which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The fair values of restricted share and performance-based stock awards are determined based on the average of the high and low trading prices on the grant date, and the fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that utilizes the assumptions outlined in the following table. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and are sensitive to changes in the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock, which can materially affect the fair value estimate. Expected life of options granted since the inception of the LTIP awards has been based on the safe harbor rule of the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107  Share-Based Payment  as the Company believes historical exercise data may not provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term of these options. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock, which correlates with the expected life of the options, and the risk-free interest rate is based on comparable U.S. Treasury rates.  Management reviews and adjusts the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of an option on a periodic basis to better reflect expected trends.   
  The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted in the nine month periods ending   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Stock based compensation is recognized based upon the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest, taking into account expected forfeitures.  In addition, for performance-based awards, an estimate is made of the number of shares expected to vest as a result of actual performance against the performance criteria in the award to determine the amount of compensation expense to recognize. The estimate is reevaluated periodically and total compensation expense is adjusted for any change in estimate in the current period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was   $2.0 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   and   $2.5 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  , and   $6.8 million   and   $7.8 million   for the year-to-date periods, respectively.

Earnings per Share 
    
  The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated: 

Potentially dilutive common shares can result from stock options, restricted stock unit awards, stock warrants, the Company s convertible preferred stock and shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Directors Deferred Fee and Stock Plan, being treated as if they had been either exercised or issued, computed by application of the treasury stock method. While potentially dilutive common shares are typically included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from this computation in periods in which the effect would reduce the loss per share or increase the income per share. For diluted earnings per share, net income applicable to common shares can be affected by the conversion of the Company s convertible preferred stock. Where the effect of this conversion would reduce the loss per share or increase the income per share, net income applicable to common shares is not adjusted by the associated preferred dividends.

  Introduction 
    
  Wintrust is a financial holding company that provides traditional community banking services, primarily in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin, and operates other financing businesses on a national basis and in Canada through several non-bank subsidiaries. Additionally, Wintrust offers a full array of wealth management services primarily to customers in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin. 
    
  Overview 
    
  Third Quarter   Highlights 
    
  The Company recorded net income of   $53.1 million   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $38.4 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  . The results for the   third quarter of 2016   demonstrate continued momentum on our operating strengths including strong loan and deposit growth driving higher net interest income, higher mortgage banking and wealth management revenue, increased fees from covered call options and improving credit quality metrics. 
    
  The Company increased its loan portfolio, excluding covered loans and mortgage loans held-for-sale, from   $16.3 billion   at   September 30, 2015   and   $17.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015   to   $19.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . The increase in the current quarter compared to the prior quarters was primarily a result of the Company s commercial banking initiative, growth in the commercial, commercial real estate and life insurance premium finance receivables portfolios and the acquisition of Generations and performing loans and relationships acquired from an affiliate of GE Capital Franchise Finance. The Company is focused on making new loans, including in the commercial and commercial real estate sector, where opportunities that meet our underwriting standards exist.  For more information regarding changes in the Company s loan portfolio, see  Financial Condition   Interest Earning Assets  and Note 6  Loans  of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report. 
    
  Management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk.  During the   third quarter of 2016  , the Company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the Company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, the Company benefited from its strong deposit base, a liquid short-term investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $1.1 billion   in overnight liquid funds and interest-bearing deposits with banks. 
    
  The Company recorded net interest income of   $184.6 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $165.5 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  . The higher level of net interest income recorded in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015   resulted primarily from a   $2.6 billion   increase in average loans, excluding covered loans. The increase in average loans, excluding covered loans, was partially offset by a   eight   basis point decline in the yield on earning assets, on a fully tax-equivalent basis and a four basis point increase in the rate on interest bearing liabilities (see "Net Interest Income" for further detail). 
    
  Non-interest income totaled   $86.6 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , an increase of   $21.7 million  , or   33  %, compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . The increase in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015   was primarily attributable to higher mortgage banking and wealth management revenue, higher gains on sales of investment securities, increased operating lease income, an increase in service charges on deposits and fees from covered call options and higher BOLI income (see  Non-Interest Income  for further detail).   
    
  Non-interest expense totaled   $176.6 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , increasing   $16.6 million  , or   10  %, compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . The increase compared to the   third quarter of 2015   was primarily attributable to higher salary and employee benefit costs caused by the addition of employees from the various acquisitions, and higher staffing levels as the Company grows, increased equipment expense, including operating lease equipment depreciation, higher OREO expenses and professional fees(see  Non-Interest Expense  for further detail).

Announced Acquisitions 
    
  On July 6, 2016, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire First Community Financial Corporation ("FCFC"). FCFC is the parent company of First Community Bank, an Illinois state-chartered bank, which operates two banking locations in Elgin, Illinois. As of September 30, 2016, First Community Bank had approximately $172 million in assets, approximately $81 million in loans and approximately $147 million in deposits. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Earnings Summary 
    
  The Company s key operating measures for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period last year, are shown below:    

(1) 
    Net revenue is net interest income plus non-interest income. 
              (2) 
    See following section titled,  Supplementary Financial Measures/Ratios  for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. 
              (3) 
    The net overhead ratio is calculated by netting total non-interest expense and total non-interest income, annualizing this amount, and dividing by that period s total average assets. A lower ratio indicates a higher degree of efficiency. 
              (4) 
    The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments. 
       
  Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, and quarterly growth rates are  annualized  in this presentation and throughout this report to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical purposes to better discern for decision-making purposes

underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, balance sheet growth rates are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate. As such, 5% growth during a quarter would represent an annualized growth rate of 20%. 

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL MEASURES/RATIOS 
    
  The accounting and reporting policies of Wintrust conform to generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), net interest margin (including its individual components), the efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, tangible common book value per share and return on average tangible common equity. Management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the Company s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently. 
    
  Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent ( FTE ) basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a FTE basis is also used in the calculation of the Company s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company s equity.  The Company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability.

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The Company s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States and prevailing practices of the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Certain policies and accounting principles inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments, and as such have a greater possibility that changes in those estimates and assumptions could produce financial results that are materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates and assumptions. Management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements. Management currently views critical accounting policies to include the determination of the allowance for loan losses, allowance for covered loan losses and the allowance for losses on lending-related commitments, loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, estimations of fair value, the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill, the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. For a more detailed discussion on these critical accounting policies, see  Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  beginning on page   55   of the Company s   2015   Form 10-K. 

Net Income 
    
  Net income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $53.1 million  , an increase of   $14.8 million  , or   38%  , compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . On a per share basis, net income for the   third quarter of 2016   totaled   $0.92   per diluted common share compared to   $0.69   in the   third quarter of 2015  . 
    
  The most significant factors impacting net income for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year include an increase in net interest income as a result of growth in earning assets, gains on sales of investment securities, increased operating lease income, and an increase in mortgage banking revenue. These improvements were offset by an increase in non-interest expense primarily attributable to higher salary and employee benefit costs caused by the addition of employees from the various acquisitions, and higher staffing levels as the Company grows and increased equipment expense, including operating lease equipment depreciation. 

Net Interest Income 
    
  The primary source of the Company s revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earnings assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on the liabilities to fund those assets, including interest bearing deposits and other borrowings. The amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates, and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.

  The following table presents a summary of the Company s net interest income and related net interest margin, including a calculation on a fully taxable equivalent basis, for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the   second quarter of 2016   (sequential quarters) and   third quarter of 2015   (linked quarters): 

(1) 
    Liquidity management assets include available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, interest earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. 
              (2) 
    Interest income on tax-advantaged loans, trading securities and securities reflects a tax-equivalent adjustment based on a marginal federal corporate tax rate of 35%. The total adjustments for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $1.6 million  ,   $1.5 million     and   $1.2 million   respectively. 
              (3) 
    Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. 
              (4) 
    Loans, net of unearned income, include loans held-for-sale and non-accrual loans. 
              (5) 
    Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield earned on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 
              (6) 
    Net free funds are the difference between total average earning assets and total average interest-bearing liabilities. The estimated contribution to net interest margin from net free funds is calculated using the rate paid for total interest-bearing liabilities. 
              (7) 
    See  Supplemental Financial Measures/Ratios  for additional information on this performance ratio. 

For the   third quarter of 2016  , net interest income totaled   $184.6 million  , an increase of   $9.4 million   as compared to the   second quarter of 2016   and an increase of   $19.1 million   as compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . Net interest margin was   3.21%   (  3.24%   on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   3.24%   (  3.27%   on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during the   second quarter of 2016   and   3.31%   (  3.33%   on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during the   third quarter of 2015  . The reduction in net interest margin compared to the   second quarter of 2016   is primarily the result of a decline in yields on mortgage-backed securities due to accelerated premium amortization. In the   third quarter of 2016  ,   $1.8 million   of premium amortization was accelerated due to payment on the underlying security, compared to   $751,000   in the   second quarter of 2016  .

    Liquidity management assets include available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, interest earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. 
              (2) 
    Interest income on tax-advantaged loans, trading securities and securities reflects a tax-equivalent adjustment based on a marginal federal corporate tax rate of 35%. The total adjustments for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $4.5 million   and   $3.4 million   respectively. 
              (3) 
    Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. 
              (4) 
    Loans, net of unearned income, include loans held-for-sale and non-accrual loans.

    See  Supplemental Financial Measures/Ratios  for additional information on this performance ratio. 
       
  For the   first nine months of 2016  , net interest income totaled   $531.4 million  , an increase of   $57.1 million   as compared to the   first nine months of 2015  . Net interest margin was   3.25%   (  3.27%   on a fully tax-equivalent basis) for the   first nine months of 2016   compared to   3.36%   (  3.39%   on a fully tax-equivalent basis) for the same period of   2015  . The reduction in net interest margin compared to the   first nine months of 2015   is primarily the result of a decline in loan yields, including less accretion recognized on purchased loans, and an increase on the rate of interest bearing liabilities.

  The increase in wealth management revenue during the current periods as compared to the same periods of 2015 is primarily attributable to growth in assets under management due to new customers. Wealth management revenue is comprised of the trust and asset management revenue of The Chicago Trust Company and Great Lakes Advisors and the brokerage commissions, managed money fees and insurance product commissions at Wayne Hummer Investments Investments, LLC ("WHI"). 
    
  The increase in mortgage banking revenue in the current periods compared to the prior year periods is primarily due to higher origination volumes during the current year. Mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale totaled $1.3 billion in the current quarter as compared to $973.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. On a year-to-date basis, mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale totaled $3.2 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $3.1 billion for the same period of 2015. This increase in revenue in the third quarter of 2016 was partly offset by a $2.5 million negative fair value adjustment on MSRs as a result of actual prepayments in the current period and higher projected prepayment speeds. Mortgage banking revenue includes revenue from activities related to originating, selling and servicing residential real estate loans for the secondary market.   Mortgage revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of MSRs as the Company does not hedge this change in fair value. The Company typically originates mortgage loans held-for-sale with associated MSRs either retained or released. The Company records MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis.

The table below presents additional selected information regarding mortgage banking revenue for the respective periods. 

(1) 
    Production revenue represents revenue earned from the origination and subsequent sale of mortgages, including gains on loans sold and fees from originations, processing and other related activities, and excludes servicing fees, changes in fair value of servicing rights and changes to the mortgage recourse obligation. 
       
  The increase in service charges on deposit accounts in the current quarter is mostly a result of higher account analysis fees on deposit accounts which have increased as a result of the Company's commercial banking initiative as well as additional service charges on deposit accounts from acquired institutions.  
    
  The increase in net gains on investment securities in the current quarter primarily relate to the sales and calls of certain mortgage-backed securities that were held in the Company's investment securities portfolio. 
    
  The Company has typically written call options with terms of less than three months against certain U.S. Treasury and agency securities held in its portfolio for liquidity and other purposes. Management has effectively entered into these transactions with the goal of economically hedging security positions and enhancing its overall return on its investment portfolio by using fees generated from these options to compensate for net interest margin compression. These option transactions are designed to mitigate overall interest rate risk and do not qualify as hedges pursuant to accounting guidance. Fees from covered call options decreased in the current year compared to the same period of 2015 primarily as a result of selling call options against a smaller value of underlying securities resulting in lower premiums received by the Company. There were no outstanding call option contracts at   September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 
    
  The increase in operating lease income in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarters is primarily related to growth in business from the Company's leasing divisions. 
    
  The increase in other non-interest income during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015 is primarily due to the gain on extinguishment of junior subordinated debentures, higher swap fee revenues resulting from interest rate hedging transactions related to both customer-based trades and the related matched trades with inter-bank dealer counterparties, gains recognized on the purchase and sale of certain assets and income from investments in partnerships and other investments, partially offset by lower income on BOLI.

  Notable contributions to the change in non-interest expense are as follows:  
    
  Salaries and employee benefits expense increased in the current periods compared to the same periods of 2015 primarily as a result of the addition of employees from acquisitions, increased staffing as the Company grows, higher commissions and incentive

compensation on variable pay based arrangements and an increase in employee benefits (primarily health plan and payroll taxes related).      
     
  Operating lease equipment depreciation increased in the current quarter and year-to-date periods compared to the same periods of   2015   as a result of growth in business from the Company's leasing divisions. 

Income Taxes 
    
  The Company recorded income tax expense of   $31.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $23.8 million   for same period of   2015  . Income tax expense was   $91.3 million   and   $74.1 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rates were 37.6% and 38.3% for the third quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and 37.5% and 37.9% for the 2016 and 2015 year-to-date periods, respectively.  

Operating Segment Results 
    
  As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, the Company s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. The Company s profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income, provision for credit losses, non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment. For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances.  Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment.  Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment.  Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment's risk-weighted assets.   
    
  The community banking segment s net interest income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $150.2 million   as compared to   $132.5 million   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of $17.6 million, or   13%  . On a year-to-date basis, net interest income for the segment increased by   $51.9 million   from   $382.2 million   for the first nine months of 2015 to   $434.1 million   for the first nine months of 2016. The increase in both the three and nine month periods is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets including those acquired in acquisitions. The community banking segment s non-interest income totaled   $62.7 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , an increase of   $17.2 million  , or   38%  , when compared to the   third quarter of 2015   total of   $45.6 million  . On a year-to-date basis, non-interest income totaled   $169.2 million   for the first nine months of 2016, an increase of   $22.5 million  , or   15%  , compared to   $146.7 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in non-interest income in the quarter and year-to-date periods was primarily attributable to higher service charges on deposit accounts and increased realized gains on investment securities as well as a gain on the extinguishment of debt and higher mortgage banking revenue on a year-to-date basis. The community banking segment s net income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $37.5 million  , an increase of   $14.8 million   as compared to net income in the   third quarter of 2015   of   $22.7 million  . On a year-to-date basis, the community banking segment's net income was   $106.9 million   for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to   $76.8 million   for the first nine months of 2015. 
    
  The specialty finance segment's net interest income totaled   $25.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $24.7 million   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of   $886,000  , or   4%  . On a year-to-date basis, net interest income increased by   $4.0 million   in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015. The increase during both periods is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets. The specialty finance segment s non-interest income totaled   $12.2 million   and   $8.3 million   for the three month periods ending   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, non-interest income increased by   $11.8 million   in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015. The increase in non-interest income in the current year periods is primarily the result of higher originations and increased balances related to the life insurance premium finance portfolio as well as increased leasing activity since the prior year periods. Our commercial premium finance operations, life insurance finance operations, lease financing operations and accounts receivable finance operations accounted for 47%, 33%, 13% and 7%, respectively, of the total revenues of our specialty finance business for the nine month period ending   September 30, 2016  .  The net income of the specialty finance segment for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $12.8 million   as compared to   $12.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . On a year-to-date basis, the net income of the specialty finance segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled   $36.3 million   as compared to   $34.9 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  The wealth management segment reported net interest income of   $4.8 million   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $4.4 million   in the same quarter of   2015  . On a year-to-date basis, net interest income totaled   $13.7 million   for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to   $12.8 million   for the first nine months of 2015. Net interest income for this segment is primarily comprised  
  
   66 

     Table of Contents  

of an allocation of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on non-interest bearing and interest-bearing wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks. Wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks averaged $987.8 million and $892.4 million in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. This segment recorded non-interest income of   $20.0 million   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $18.4 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  . On a year-to-date basis, the wealth management segment's non-interest income totaled   $58.7 million   during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to   $56.1 million   in the first nine months of 2015. Distribution of wealth management services through each bank continues to be a focus of the Company as the number of financial advisors in its banks continues to increase. The Company is committed to growing the wealth management segment in order to better service its customers and create a more diversified revenue stream. The wealth management segment s net income totaled   $2.8 million   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to $3.1 million for the third quarter of 2015. On a year-to-date basis, the wealth management segment's net income totaled   $9.1 million   and   $9.5 million   for the nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The reduction in net income in the current periods compared to the prior periods is partly due to a $1.5 million adverse arbitration award relating to a previously disclosed claim arising out of the hiring of a wealth management financial advisor by WHI. 

Financial Condition 
    
  Total assets were   $25.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , representing an increase of   $3.3 billion  , or   15%  , when compared to   September 30, 2015   and an increase of approximately   $901.1 million  , or   15%   on an annualized basis, when compared to   June 30, 2016  . Total funding, which includes deposits, all notes and advances, including secured borrowings and the junior subordinated debentures, was   $22.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  ,    $21.3 billion   at   June 30, 2016  , and   $19.3 billion   at   September 30, 2015  . See Notes 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for additional period-end detail on the Company s interest-earning assets and funding liabilities. 
    
  Interest-Earning Assets 
    
  The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of average earning asset balances and the relative percentage of total average earning assets for the periods presented: 

(1) 
    Includes mortgage loans held-for-sale 
              (2) 
    Includes loans held-for-sale and non-accrual loans 
              (3) 
    Liquidity management assets include investment securities, other securities, interest earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
              (4) 
    Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities 
       
  Loans.   Average total loans, net of unearned income, totaled   $19.2 billion   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , increasing   $2.5 billion  , or   15%  , from the   third quarter   of   2015   and   $859.1 million  , or   19%   on an annualized basis, from the   second quarter of 2016  . Combined, the commercial and commercial real estate loan categories comprised   59%   and   57%   of the average loan portfolio in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Growth realized in these categories for the   third quarter   of   2016   as compared to the  
  
   67 

     Table of Contents  

sequential and prior year periods is primarily attributable to the various bank acquisitions and increased business development efforts. 
    
  Home equity loan portfolio averaged   $751.8 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , and decreased   $28.1 million  , or   4%   from the average balance of   $779.9 million   in same period of   2015  . The Company has been actively managing its home equity portfolio to ensure that diligent pricing, appraisal and other underwriting activities continue to exist.  The Company has not sacrificed asset quality or pricing standards when originating new home equity loans. 
    
  Residential real estate loans averaged   $1.2 billion   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , and increased   $212.5 million  , or   22%   from the average balance of   $952.5 million   in same period of   2015  . Additionally, compared to the quarter ended   June 30, 2016  , the average balance increased   $140.6 million  , or   55%   on an annualized basis. The residential real estate loan category includes mortgage loans held-for-sale. By selling residential mortgage loans into the secondary market, the Company eliminates the interest-rate risk associated with these loans, as they are predominantly long-term fixed rate loans, and provides a source of non-interest revenue.  
    
  Average premium finance receivables totaled   $5.7 billion   in the   third quarter   of   2016  , and accounted for   30%   of the Company s average total loans. The increase during   2016   compared to both the second quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015 was the result of continued originations within the portfolio due to the effective marketing and customer servicing. Approximately   $1.7 billion   of premium finance receivables were originated in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $1.6 billion   during the same period of   2015  . Premium finance receivables consist of a commercial portfolio and a life portfolio comprising approximately   44%   and   56%  , respectively, of the average total balance of premium finance receivables for the   third quarter   of   2016  , and   49%   and   51%  , respectively, for the   third quarter   of   2015  .  
    
  Other loans represent a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals as well as high-yielding short-term accounts receivable financing to clients in the temporary staffing industry located throughout the United States. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk due to the type and nature of the collateral. Additionally, short-term accounts receivable financing may also involve greater credit risks than generally associated with the loan portfolios of more traditional community banks depending on the marketability of the collateral. 
    
  Covered loans represent loans acquired through the nine FDIC-assisted transactions, all of which occurred prior to 2013. These loans are subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. The FDIC has agreed to reimburse the Company for 80% of losses incurred on the purchased loans, foreclosed real estate, and certain other assets. The Company expects the covered loan portfolio to continue to decrease as these acquired loans are paid off and as loss sharing agreements expire. See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for a discussion of these acquisitions, including the aggregation of these loans by risk characteristics when determining the initial and subsequent fair value. 
    
  Liquidity management assets.   Funds that are not utilized for loan originations are used to purchase investment securities and short term money market investments, to sell as federal funds and to maintain in interest bearing deposits with banks. The balances of these assets can fluctuate based on management s ongoing effort to manage liquidity and for asset liability management purposes. 
    
  Other earning assets.   Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. In the normal course of business, WHI activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various securities transactions. WHI s customer securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, WHI, under an agreement with an out-sourced securities firm, extends credit to its customers, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in customer s accounts. In connection with these activities, WHI executes and the out-sourced firm clears customer transactions relating to the sale of securities not yet purchased, substantially all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to individual exchange regulations. Such transactions may expose WHI to off-balance-sheet risk, particularly in volatile trading markets, in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur. In the event a customer fails to satisfy its obligations, WHI under the agreement with the outsourced securities firm, may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customer s obligations. WHI seeks to control the risks associated with its customers  activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines. WHI monitors required margin levels daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary.

  Total average loans for the   first nine months ended 2016   increased   $2.5 billion   or   15%   over the previous year period. Similar to the quarterly discussion above, approximately   $872.4 million   of this increase relates to the commercial portfolio,   $911.8 million   of this increase relates to the commercial real estate portfolio and   $600.2 million   of this increase relates to the premium finance receivables portfolio. The increase is partially offset by a decrease of   $79.6 million   in covered loans.  

LOAN PORTFOLIO AND ASSET QUALITY 
   
  Loan Portfolio 
    
  The following table shows the Company s loan portfolio by category as of the dates shown:

     Table of Contents  

Commercial and commercial real estate loans.   Our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are comprised primarily of commercial real estate loans and lines of credit for working capital purposes. The table below sets forth information regarding the types and amounts of our loans within these portfolios (excluding covered loans) as of   September 30, 2016   and 2015: 

(1)   
    PCI loans represent loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, in accordance with ASC 310-30. Loan agings are based upon contractually required payments. 
       
  We make commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines, which are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. Commercial business lending is generally considered to involve a slightly higher degree of risk than traditional consumer bank lending. Primarily as a result of growth in the commercial portfolio, our allowance for loan losses in our commercial loan portfolio is   $43.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $34.0 million   as of   September 30, 2015  . 

70 

     Table of Contents  

Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property. Since most of our bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin,   89.7%   of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region as of   September 30, 2016  . While commercial real estate market conditions have improved recently, a number of specific markets continue to be under stress. We have been able to effectively manage our total non-performing commercial real estate loans.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our allowance for loan losses related to this portfolio is   $48.3 million   compared to   $44.1 million   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The Company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market. The Company s loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the Company, after they have been pre-approved for purchase by third party end lenders. The Company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market. Amounts advanced with respect to any particular mortgage loan are usually required to be repaid within 21 days. In the current period, mortgage warehouse lines increased to   $309.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $136.6 million   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Home equity loans.   Our home equity loans and lines of credit are originated by each of our banks in their local markets where we have a strong understanding of the underlying real estate value. Our banks monitor and manage these loans, and we conduct an automated review of all home equity loans and lines of credit at least twice per year. This review collects current credit performance for each home equity borrower and identifies situations where the credit strength of the borrower is declining, or where there are events that may influence repayment, such as tax liens or judgments. Our banks use this information to manage loans that may be higher risk and to determine whether to obtain additional credit information or updated property valuations. 
    
  The rates we offer on new home equity lending are based on several factors, including appraisals and valuation due diligence, in order to reflect inherent risk, and we place additional scrutiny on larger home equity requests. In a limited number of cases, we issue home equity credit together with first mortgage financing, and requests for such financing are evaluated on a combined basis. It is not our practice to advance more than 85% of the appraised value of the underlying asset, which ratio we refer to as the loan-to-value ratio, or LTV ratio, and a majority of the credit we previously extended, when issued, had an LTV ratio of less than 80%. 
  Our home equity loan portfolio has performed well in light of the ongoing volatility in the overall residential real estate market.  
    
  Residential real estate mortgages.   Our residential real estate portfolio predominantly includes one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgages that have repricing terms generally from one to three years, construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers. As of   September 30, 2016  , our residential loan portfolio totaled   $663.6 million  , or   3%   of our total outstanding loans. 
    
  Our adjustable rate mortgages relate to properties located principally in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin or vacation homes owned by local residents. These adjustable rate mortgages are often non-agency conforming. Adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the interest rate risk we face on our mortgage portfolio. However, this risk is not eliminated due to the fact that such loans generally provide for periodic and lifetime limits on the interest rate adjustments among other features. Additionally, adjustable rate mortgages may pose a higher risk of delinquency and default because they require borrowers to make larger payments when interest rates rise. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $12.2 million   of our residential real estate mortgages, or   1.8%   of our residential real estate loan portfolio were classified as nonaccrual,   $1.5 million   were 90 or more days past due and still accruing (  0.2%  ),   $3.3 million   were 30 to 89 days past due (  0.5%  ) and   $646.6 million   were current (  97.5%  ). We believe that since our loan portfolio consists primarily of locally originated loans, and since the majority of our borrowers are longer-term customers with lower LTV ratios, we face a relatively low risk of borrower default and delinquency. 
    
  While we generally do not originate loans for our own portfolio with long-term fixed rates due to interest rate risk considerations, we can accommodate customer requests for fixed rate loans by originating such loans and then selling them into the secondary market, for which we receive fee income. We may also selectively retain certain of these loans within the banks  own portfolios where they are non-agency conforming, or where the terms of the loans make them favorable to retain. A portion of the loans we sold into the secondary market were sold with the servicing of those loans retained. The amount of loans serviced for others as of   September 30, 2016   and 2015 was   $1.5 billion   and   $853.3 million  , respectively. All other mortgage loans sold into the secondary market were sold without the retention of servicing rights.   
    
  It is not our current practice to underwrite, and we have no plans to underwrite, subprime, Alt A, no or little documentation loans, or option ARM loans. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $4.8 million   of our mortgage loans consist of interest-only loans. 
    
  Premium finance receivables   commercial.   FIFC and FIFC Canada originated approximately   $1.4 billion   in commercial insurance premium finance receivables during both the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  . During both the   nine months ended September 30,  
  
   71 

     Table of Contents  

2016   and   2015  , FIFC and FIFC Canada originated approximately   $4.3 billion   in commercial insurance premium finance receivable. FIFC and FIFC Canada make loans to businesses to finance the insurance premiums they pay on their commercial insurance policies. The loans are originated by working through independent medium and large insurance agents and brokers located throughout the United States and Canada. The insurance premiums financed are primarily for commercial customers  purchases of liability, property and casualty and other commercial insurance. 
    
  This lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations. Because of the indirect nature of this lending through third party agents and brokers and because the borrowers are located nationwide and in Canada, this segment is more susceptible to third party fraud than relationship lending.  The Company performs ongoing credit and other reviews of the agents and brokers, and performs various internal audit steps to mitigate against the risk of any fraud. The majority of these loans are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments. 
    
  Premium finance receivables life insurance.   FIFC originated approximately   $274.1 million   in life insurance premium finance receivables in the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to     $206.9 million   of originations in the   third quarter of 2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, FIFC originated approximately   $754.7 million   and   $596.2 million  , respectively, in life insurance premium finance receivables. The Company continues to experience increased competition and pricing pressure within the current market. These loans are originated directly with the borrowers with assistance from life insurance carriers, independent insurance agents, financial advisors and legal counsel. The life insurance policy is the primary form of collateral. In addition, these loans often are secured with a letter of credit, marketable securities or certificates of deposit. In some cases, FIFC may make a loan that has a partially unsecured position. 
    
  Consumer and other.   Included in the consumer and other loan category is a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals as well as high yielding short-term accounts receivable financing to clients in the temporary staffing industry located throughout the United States. The Banks originate consumer loans in order to provide a wider range of financial services to their customers. 
    
  Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than mortgage loans due to the type and nature of the collateral. Additionally, short-term accounts receivable financing may also involve greater credit risks than generally associated with the loan portfolios of more traditional community banks depending on the marketability of the collateral. 
    
  Covered loans.   Covered loans represent loans acquired through the nine FDIC-assisted transactions, all of which occurred prior to 2013. These loans are subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. The FDIC has agreed to reimburse the Company for 80% of losses incurred on the purchased loans, foreclosed real estate, and certain other assets. The Company expects the covered loan portfolio to continue to decrease as these acquired loans are paid off and as loss sharing agreements expire. See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for a discussion of these acquisitions, including the aggregation of these loans by risk characteristics when determining the initial and subsequent fair value.

Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets 
    
  Our ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on our ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which our credit management personnel assign a credit risk rating to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis to determine each loan s credit risk rating on a scale of 1 through 10 with higher scores indicating higher risk. The credit risk rating structure used is shown below: 
    
                   1 Rating   
      
    Minimal Risk (Loss Potential   none or extremely low) (Superior asset quality, excellent liquidity, minimal leverage) 

2 Rating   
      
    Modest Risk (Loss Potential demonstrably low) (Very good asset quality and liquidity, strong leverage capacity) 

3 Rating   
      
    Average Risk (Loss Potential low but no longer refutable) (Mostly satisfactory asset quality and liquidity, good leverage capacity) 

4 Rating   
      
    Above Average Risk (Loss Potential variable, but some potential for deterioration) (Acceptable asset quality, little excess liquidity, modest leverage capacity) 

5 Rating   
      
    Management Attention Risk (Loss Potential moderate if corrective action not taken) (Generally acceptable asset quality, somewhat strained liquidity, minimal leverage capacity) 

6 Rating   
      
    Special Mention (Loss Potential moderate if corrective action not taken) (Assets in this category are currently protected, potentially weak, but not to the point of substandard classification) 

7 Rating   
      
    Substandard Accrual (Loss Potential distinct possibility that the bank may sustain some loss, but no discernable impairment) (Must have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt) 

8 Rating   
      
    Substandard Non-accrual (Loss Potential well documented probability of loss, including potential impairment) (Must have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt) 

9 Rating   
      
    Doubtful (Loss Potential extremely high) (These assets have all the weaknesses in those classified  substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions, and values, highly improbable) 

10 Rating   
      
    Loss (fully charged-off) (Loans in this category are considered fully uncollectible.) 

Each loan officer is responsible for monitoring his or her loan portfolio, recommending a credit risk rating for each loan in his or her portfolio and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then ratified by the bank s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including,  a borrower s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. A third party loan review firm independently reviews  
  
   73 

     Table of Contents  

a significant portion of the loan portfolio at each of the Company s subsidiary banks to evaluate the appropriateness of the management-assigned credit risk ratings. These ratings are subject to further review at each of our bank subsidiaries by the applicable regulatory authority, including the FRB of Chicago, the OCC, the State of Illinois and the State of Wisconsin and are also reviewed by our internal audit staff. 
  The Company s problem loan reporting system automatically includes all loans with credit risk ratings of 6 through 9. This system is designed to provide an on-going detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan. Once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of 6 or worse, the Company s Managed Asset Division performs an overall credit and collateral review. As part of this review, all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked. As a result of this initial review by the Company s Managed Asset Division, the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible or an impairment reserve may be established. The Company s impairment analysis utilizes an independent re-appraisal of the collateral (unless such a third-party evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral, such as a closely-held business or thinly traded securities). In the case of commercial real estate collateral, an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the Company s Real Estate Services Group to determine if there has been any change in the underlying collateral value. These independent appraisals are reviewed by the Real Estate Services Group and sometimes by independent third party valuation experts and may be adjusted depending upon market conditions. An appraisal is ordered at least once a year for these loans, or more often if market conditions dictate. In the event that the underlying value of the collateral cannot be easily determined, a detailed valuation methodology is prepared by the Managed Asset Division. A summary of this analysis is provided to the directors  loan committee of the bank which originated the credit for approval of a charge-off, if necessary. 
    
  Through the credit risk rating process, loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status, a charge-off or the establishment of a specific impairment reserve. In the event a collateral shortfall is identified during the credit review process, the Company will work with the borrower for a principal reduction and/or a pledge of additional collateral and/or additional guarantees. In the event that these options are not available, the loan may be subject to a downgrade of the credit risk rating. If we determine that a loan amount or portion thereof, is uncollectible the loan s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded to an 8 or 9 and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. Any loan that has a partial charge-off continues to be assigned a credit risk rating of an 8 or 9 for the duration of time that a balance remains outstanding. The Managed Asset Division undertakes a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the credit to minimize actual losses. 
    
  The Company s approach to workout plans and restructuring loans is built on the credit-risk rating process. A modification of a loan with an existing credit risk rating of 6 or worse or a modification of any other credit, which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of 6 or worse must be reviewed for TDR classification. In that event, our Managed Assets Division conducts an overall credit and collateral review. A modification of a loan is considered to be a TDR if both (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) for economic or legal reasons, the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The modification of a loan where the credit risk rating is 5 or better both before and after such modification is not considered to be a TDR. Based on the Company s credit risk rating system, it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is 5 or better are not experiencing financial difficulties and therefore, are not considered TDRs. 
    
  TDRs, which are by definition considered impaired loans, are reviewed at the time of modification and on a quarterly basis to determine if a specific reserve is needed. The carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan s original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific reserve.  
    
  For non-TDR loans, if based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a loan is considered impaired, and a specific impairment reserve analysis is performed and if necessary, a specific reserve is established. In determining the appropriate reserve for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral.

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $49.1 million   of all loans, excluding covered loans, or   0.3%  , were 60 to 89 days past due and   $70.4 million   or   0.4%  , were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. As of   June 30, 2016  ,   $75.7 million   of all loans, excluding covered loans, or   0.4%  , were 60 to 89 days past due and   $90.4 million  , or   0.5%  , were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. Many of the commercial and commercial real estate loans shown as 60 to 89 days and 30 to 59 days past due are included on the Company s internal problem loan reporting system. Loans on this system are closely monitored by management on a monthly basis.  
    
  The Company's home equity and residential loan portfolios continue to exhibit low delinquency ratios.  Home equity loans at   September 30, 2016   that were current with regard to the contractual terms of the loan agreement represent   98.0%   of the total home equity portfolio. Residential real estate loans at   September 30, 2016   that were current with regards to the contractual terms of the loan agreements comprise   97.5%   of total residential real estate loans outstanding.

           (1)   
    This includes activity for premium finance receivables and indirect consumer loans. 
       
  PCI loans are excluded from non-performing loans as they continue to earn interest income from the related accretable yield, independent of performance with contractual terms of the loan. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for further discussion of non-performing loans and the loan aging during the respective periods. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable loan losses that our loan portfolio is expected to incur. The allowance for loan losses is determined quarterly using a methodology that incorporates important risk characteristics of each loan, as described below under  How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses  in this Item 2. This process is subject to review at each of our bank subsidiaries by the applicable regulatory authority, including the FRB of Chicago, the OCC, the State of Illinois and the State of Wisconsin. 
    
  Management determined that the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at   September 30, 2016  , and that the loan portfolio is well diversified and well secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. While this process involves a high degree of management judgment, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry peers. This review encompasses levels of total nonperforming loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations, current geographic risks and overall levels of net charge-offs. Historical trending of both the Company s results and the industry peers is also reviewed to analyze comparative significance.

Allowance for Credit Losses, excluding covered loans 
    
  The following table summarizes the activity in our allowance for credit losses during the periods indicated. 

The allowance for credit losses, excluding the allowance for covered loan losses, is comprised of an allowance for loan losses, which is determined with respect to loans that we have originated, and an allowance for lending-related commitments. Our allowance for lending-related commitments is determined with respect to funds that we have committed to lend but for which funds have not yet been disbursed and is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for unfunded lending-related commitments totaled   $1.6 million   and   $926,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

79 

     Table of Contents  

Additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to earnings through the provision for credit losses. Charge-offs represent the amount of loans that have been determined to be uncollectible during a given period, and are deducted from the allowance for loan losses, and recoveries represent the amount of collections received from loans that had previously been charged off, and are credited to the allowance for loan losses. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for further discussion of activity within the allowance for loan losses during the period and the relationship with respective loan balances for each loan category and the total loan portfolio, excluding covered loans. 
    
  How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  The allowance for loan losses includes an element for estimated probable but undetected losses and for imprecision in the credit risk models used to calculate the allowance. If the loan is impaired, the Company analyzes the loan for purposes of calculating our specific impairment reserves as part of the Problem Loan Reporting system review. A general reserve is separately determined for loans not considered impaired. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for further discussion of the specific impairment reserve and general reserve as it relates to the allowance for credit losses for each loan category and the total loan portfolio, excluding covered loans. 
    
  Specific Impairment Reserves: 
    
  Loans with a credit risk rating of a 6 through 9 are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if (a) an amount is deemed uncollectible (a charge-off) or (b) it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan (impaired loan). If a loan is impaired, the carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be reserved, discounted at the loan s original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific impairment reserve. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $90.5 million   of impaired loans with   $39.0 million   of this balance requiring   $6.8 million   of specific impairment reserves. At   June 30, 2016  , the Company had   $96.0 million   of impaired loans with   $43.0 million   of this balance requiring   $6.6 million   of specific impairment reserves. The most significant fluctuations in the recorded investment of impaired loans with specific impairment from   June 30, 2016   to   September 30, 2016   occurred within the commercial, industrial and other portfolio. The recorded investment and specific impairment reserves in this portfolio decreased   $4.8 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively, which was primarily the result of three loans being charged off in the amount of   $2.0 million   during the   third quarter of 2016  . See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for further discussion of impaired loans and the related specific impairment reserve. 
    
  General Reserves: 
    
  For loans with a credit risk rating of 1 through 7 that are not considered impaired loans, reserves are established based on the type of loan collateral, if any, and the assigned credit risk rating. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on the average historical loss experience over a six-year period, and consideration of current environmental factors and economic trends, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. 
    
  We determine this component of the allowance for loan losses by classifying each loan into (i) categories based on the type of collateral that secures the loan (if any), and (ii) one of ten categories based on the credit risk rating of the loan, as described above under  Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets  in this Item 2. Each combination of collateral and credit risk rating is then assigned a specific loss factor that incorporates the following factors: 

historical loss experience; 

changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses; 

changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio; 

changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of the loans; 

changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; 

80 

     Table of Contents  

changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of non-accrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans; 

changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system; 

changes in the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; 

the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and 

the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the bank s existing portfolio. 
       
  In the second quarter of 2012, the Company modified its historical loss experience analysis from incorporating five-year average loss rate assumptions to incorporating three year average loss rate assumptions. The reason for the migration at that time was charge-off rates from earlier years in the five-year period were no longer relevant as that period was characterized by historically low credit losses which then built up to a peak in credit losses as a result of the stressed economic environment and depressed real estate valuations that affected both the U.S. economy, generally, and the Company s local markets.  
    
  In the third quarter of 2015 and 2016, the Company modified its historical loss experience analysis by incorporating five-year and six-year average loss rate assumptions, respectively, for its historical loss experience to capture an extended credit cycle. The current six year average loss rate assumption analysis is computed for each of the Company s collateral codes. The historical loss experience is combined with the specific loss factor for each combination of collateral and credit risk rating which is then applied to each individual loan balance to determine an appropriate general reserve. The historical loss rates are updated on a quarterly basis and are driven by the performance of the portfolio and any changes to the specific loss factors are driven by management judgment and analysis of the factors described above. The Company also analyzes the three-, four- and five-year average historical loss rates on a quarterly basis as a comparison. 
    
  Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loans: 
    
  The determination of the appropriate allowance for loan losses for residential real estate and home equity loans differs slightly from the process used for commercial and commercial real estate loans. The same credit risk rating system, Problem Loan Reporting system, collateral coding methodology and loss factor assignment are used. The only significant difference is in how the credit risk ratings are assigned to these loans. 
    
  The home equity loan portfolio is reviewed on a loan by loan basis by analyzing current FICO scores of the borrowers, line availability, recent line usage, an approaching maturity and the aging status of the loan. Certain of these factors, or combination of these factors, may cause a portion of the credit risk ratings of home equity loans across all banks to be downgraded. Similar to commercial and commercial real estate loans, once a home equity loan s credit risk rating is downgraded to a 6 through 9, the Company s Managed Asset Division reviews and advises the subsidiary banks as to collateral valuations and as to the ultimate resolution of the credits that deteriorate to a non-accrual status to minimize losses. 
    
  Residential real estate loans that are downgraded to a credit risk rating of 6 through 9 also enter the problem loan reporting system and have the underlying collateral evaluated by the Managed Assets Division. 
    
  Premium Finance Receivables: 
    
  The determination of the appropriate allowance for loan losses for premium finance receivables is based on the assigned credit risk rating of loans in the portfolio. Loss factors are assigned to each risk rating in order to calculate an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for loan losses for these categories is entirely a general reserve. 
    
  Methodology in Assessing Impairment and Charge-off Amounts 
    
  In determining the amount of impairment or charge-offs associated with collateral dependent loans, the Company values the loan generally by starting with a valuation obtained from an appraisal of the underlying collateral and then deducting estimated selling costs to arrive at a net appraised value. We obtain the appraisals of the underlying collateral typically on an annual basis from one of a pre-approved list of independent, third party appraisal firms. Types of appraisal valuations include  as-is,   as-complete,   as-stabilized,  bulk, fair market, liquidation and  retail sellout  values. 

81 

     Table of Contents  

In many cases, the Company simultaneously values the underlying collateral by marketing the property to market participants interested in purchasing properties of the same type. If the Company receives offers or indications of interest, we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether in light of such information the appraised value overstates the likely price and that a lower price would be a better assessment of the market value of the property and would enable us to liquidate the collateral. Additionally, the Company takes into account the strength of any guarantees and the ability of the borrower to provide value related to those guarantees in determining the ultimate charge-off or reserve associated with any impaired loans. Accordingly, the Company may charge-off a loan to a value below the net appraised value if it believes that an expeditious liquidation is desirable in the circumstance and it has legitimate offers or other indications of interest to support a value that is less than the net appraised value. Alternatively, the Company may carry a loan at a value that is in excess of the appraised value if the Company has a guarantee from a borrower that the Company believes has realizable value. In evaluating the strength of any guarantee, the Company evaluates 
  the financial wherewithal of the guarantor, the guarantor s reputation, and the guarantor s willingness and desire to work with the Company. The Company then conducts a review of the strength of a guarantee on a frequency established as the circumstances and conditions of the borrower warrant. 
    
  In circumstances where the Company has received an appraisal but has no third party offers or indications of interest, the Company may enlist the input of realtors in the local market as to the highest valuation that the realtor believes would result in a liquidation of the property given a reasonable marketing period of approximately 90 days. To the extent that the realtors  indication of market clearing price under such scenario is less than the net appraised valuation, the Company may take a charge-off on the loan to a valuation that is less than the net appraised valuation. 
    
  The Company may also charge-off a loan below the net appraised valuation if the Company holds a junior mortgage position in a piece of collateral whereby the risk to acquiring control of the property through the purchase of the senior mortgage position is deemed to potentially increase the risk of loss upon liquidation due to the amount of time to ultimately market the property and the volatile market conditions. In such cases, the Company may abandon its junior mortgage and charge-off the loan balance in full. 
    
  In other cases, the Company may allow the borrower to conduct a  short sale,  which is a sale where the Company allows the borrower to sell the property at a value less than the amount of the loan. Many times, it is possible for the current owner to receive a better price than if the property is marketed by a financial institution which the market place perceives to have a greater desire to liquidate the property at a lower price. To the extent that we allow a short sale at a price below the value indicated by an appraisal, we may take a charge-off beyond the value that an appraisal would have indicated. 
    
  Other market conditions may require a reserve to bring the carrying value of the loan below the net appraised valuation such as litigation surrounding the borrower and/or property securing our loan or other market conditions impacting the value of the collateral. 
    
  Having determined the net value based on the factors such as those noted above and compared that value to the book value of the loan, the Company arrives at a charge-off amount or a specific reserve included in the allowance for loan losses. In summary, for collateral dependent loans, appraisals are used as the fair value starting point in the estimate of net value. Estimated costs to sell are deducted from the appraised value to arrive at the net appraised value. Although an external appraisal is the primary source of valuation utilized for charge-offs on collateral dependent loans, alternative sources of valuation may become available between appraisal dates. As a result, we may utilize values obtained through these alternating sources, which include purchase and sale agreements, legitimate indications of interest, negotiated short sales, realtor price opinions, sale of the note or support from guarantors, as the basis for charge-offs. These alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution. In addition, if an appraisal is not deemed current, a discount to appraised value may be utilized. Any adjustments from appraised value to net value are detailed and justified in an impairment analysis, which is reviewed and approved by the Company s Managed Assets Division.

TDRs 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $44.3 million   in loans modified in TDRs.  The   $44.3 million   in TDRs represents   89   credits in which economic concessions were granted to certain borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay. The balance decreased from   $49.6 million   representing   97   credits at   June 30, 2016   and decreased from   $59.3 million   representing   114   credits at   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Concessions were granted on a case-by-case basis working with these borrowers to find modified terms that would assist them in retaining their businesses or their homes and attempt to keep these loans in an accruing status for the Company. Typical concessions include reduction of the interest rate on the loan to a rate considered lower than market and other modification of terms including forgiveness of a portion of the loan balance, extension of the maturity date, and/or modifications from principal and interest payments to interest-only payments for a certain period. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for further discussion regarding the effectiveness of these modifications in keeping the modified loans current based upon contractual terms. 
    
  Subsequent to its restructuring, any TDR that becomes nonaccrual or more than 90 days past-due and still accruing interest will be included in the Company s nonperforming loans. Each TDR was reviewed for impairment at   September 30, 2016   and approximately   $2.8 million   of impairment was present and appropriately reserved for through the Company s normal reserving methodology in the Company s allowance for loan losses.  Additionally, at   September 30, 2016  , the Company was not committed to lend additional funds to borrowers under the contractual terms of TDRs.

The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of average deposit balances and the relative percentage of total average deposits for the periods presented: 

Total average deposits for the   third quarter of 2016   were $20.7 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion, or 15%, from the   third quarter of 2015  . The increase in average deposits is primarily attributable to additional deposits associated with the Company's bank acquisitions as well as increased commercial lending relationships. The Company continues to see a beneficial shift in its deposit mix as average non-interest bearing deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 24%, in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . 
    
  Wealth management deposits are funds from the brokerage customers of WHI, the trust and asset management customers of the Company and brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks ( wealth management deposits  in the table above). Wealth Management deposits consist primarily of money market accounts. Consistent with reasonable interest rate risk parameters, these funds have generally been invested in loan production of the banks as well as other investments suitable for banks. 
    
  Brokered Deposits 
    
  While the Company obtains a portion of its total deposits through brokered deposits, the Company does so primarily as an asset-liability management tool to assist in the management of interest rate risk. The Company does not consider brokered deposits to be a vital component of its current liquidity resources. Historically, brokered deposits have represented a small component of the Company s total deposits outstanding, as set forth in the table below: 

Brokered deposits include certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers, deposits received through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Program ( CDARS ), and wealth management deposits of brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks. 

Other Funding Sources 
    
  Although deposits are the Company s primary source of funding its interest-earning assets, the Company s ability to manage the types and terms of deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and market competition. As a result, in addition to deposits and the issuance of equity securities and the retention of earnings, the Company uses several other funding sources to support its growth. These sources include short-term borrowings, notes payable, FHLB advances, subordinated debt, secured borrowings and junior subordinated debentures. The Company evaluates the terms and unique characteristics of each source, as well as its asset-liability management position, in determining the use of such funding sources. 

86 

     Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of the average balances of other funding sources for the quarterly periods presented: 

FHLB advances provide the banks with access to fixed rate funds which are useful in mitigating interest rate risk and achieving an acceptable interest rate spread on fixed rate loans or securities. Additionally, the banks have the ability to borrow shorter-term, overnight funding from the FHLB for other general purposes. FHLB advances to the banks totaled   $419.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $588.1 million   at   June 30, 2016   and   $444.0 million   at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Notes payable balances represent the balances on a   $150 million   loan agreement with unaffiliated banks consisting of a   $75.0 million   revolving credit facility and a   $75.0 million   term facility. Both loan facilities are available for corporate purposes such as to provide capital to fund continued growth at existing bank subsidiaries, possible future acquisitions and for other general corporate matters. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a balance under the term facility of   $56.2 million   compared to   $59.9 million   at   June 30, 2016   and   $71.3 million   at   September 30, 2015  . The Company was contractually required to borrow the entire amount of the term facility on   June 15, 2015   and all such borrowings must be repaid by   June 15, 2020  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company had no outstanding balance on the   $75.0 million   revolving credit facility.  
    
  Short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased.  These borrowings totaled   $33.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $38.8 million   at   June 30, 2016   and   $57.6 million   at   September 30, 2015  . Securities sold under repurchase agreements represent sweep accounts for certain customers in connection with master repurchase agreements at the banks. This funding category typically fluctuates based on customer preferences and daily liquidity needs of the banks, their customers and the banks  operating subsidiaries.  
    
  The average balance of secured borrowings primarily represents a third party Canadian transaction ("Canadian Secured Borrowing"). Under the Canadian Secured Borrowing, in December 2014, the Company, through its subsidiary, FIFC Canada, sold an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to FIFC Canada to an unrelated third party in exchange for a cash payment of approximately   C$150 million   pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement ( Receivables Purchase Agreement ). The Receivables Purchase Agreement was amended in December 2015, effectively extending the maturity date from December 15, 2015 to December 15, 2017. Additionally, at that time, the unrelated third party paid an additional   C$10 million  , which increased the total payments to   C$160 million  . The proceeds received from these transactions are reflected on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Condition as a secured borrowing owed to the unrelated third party and translated to the Company s reporting currency as of the respective date. The translated balance of the Canadian Secured Borrowing under the Receivables Purchase Agreement totaled   $121.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $123.7 million   at   June 30, 2016   and   $112.6 million   at   September 30, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate of the Canadian Secured Borrowing was   1.6121%  . 
    
  Other borrowings include a fixed-rate promissory note entered into in August 2012 related to an office building complex owned by the Company and non-recourse notes issued by the Company to other banks related to certain capital leases. At   September 30, 2016  , the fixed-rate promissory note had a balance of   $17.8 million   compared to   $18.0 million   at   June 30, 2016   and   $18.3 million   at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding subordinated notes totaling   $138.9 million   compared to   $138.9 million   and   $138.8 million   outstanding at   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The notes have a stated interest rate of   5.00%   and mature in   June 2024  . These notes are stated at par adjusted for unamortized costs paid related to the issuance of this debt.

The Company had   $253.6 million   of junior subordinated debentures outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $253.6 million   outstanding at   June 30, 2016   and   $268.6 million   outstanding at   September 30, 2015  .   The amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the junior subordinated debentures issued to   eleven   trusts by the Company and equal the amount of the preferred and common securities issued by the trusts. The balance increased   $19.1 million   in 2015 as a result of the addition of the Suburban Illinois Capital Trust II and Community Financial Shares Statutory Trust II acquired as a part of the acquisitions of Suburban and CFIS, respectively. Additionally, in January 2016, the Company acquired   $15.0 million   of the   $40.0 million   of trust preferred securities issued by Wintrust Capital Trust VIII from a third-party investor. The purchase effectively extinguished   $15.0 million    of junior subordinated debentures related to Wintrust Capital Trust VIII and resulted in a   $4.3 million   gain from the early extinguishment of debt.   Prior to January 1, 2015, the junior subordinated debentures, subject to certain limitations, qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital of the Company and the amount in excess of those certain limitations could, subject to other restrictions, be included in Tier 2 capital. Starting in 2015, a portion of these junior subordinated debentures qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital of the Company and the amount in excess of those certain limitations, subject to certain restrictions, was included in Tier 2 capital. At   September 30, 2015  ,   $65.1 million   and   $195.4 million   of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, were included in the Company's Tier 1 and Tier 2 regulatory capital, respectively. Starting in 2016,   none   of the junior subordinated debentures qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital of the Company resulting in   $245.5 million   of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, being included in the Company's Tier 2 regulatory capital.

Shareholders  Equity 
    
  The following tables reflect various consolidated measures of capital as of the dates presented and the capital guidelines established by the FRB for a bank holding company: 

(1) 
    Based on quarterly average balances. 

The Company s principal sources of funds at the holding company level are dividends from its subsidiaries, borrowings under its loan agreement with unaffiliated banks and proceeds from the issuances of subordinated debt and additional equity. Refer to Notes 10, 11 and 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for further information on these various funding sources. Management is committed to maintaining the Company s capital levels above the  Well Capitalized  levels established by the FRB for bank holding companies. 
    
  The Company s Board of Directors approves dividends from time to time, however, the ability to declare a dividend is limited by the Company's financial condition, the terms of the Company's 5.00% non-cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock, Series C,  the terms of the Company's fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series D, the terms of the Company s Trust Preferred Securities offerings and under certain financial covenants in the Company s revolving and term facilities. In January, April and July of 2016, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per common share. In January, April, July and October of 2015, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per common share. 
    
  See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for details on the Company s issuance of Series D and Series C preferred stock in June 2015 and March 2012, respectively, as well as details on the Company's offering

LIQUIDITY 
    
  Wintrust manages the liquidity position of its banking operations to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet customers  needs for loans and deposit withdrawals. The liquidity to meet these demands is provided by maturing assets, liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from external sources. Liquid assets refer to money market assets such as Federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks, as well as available-for-sale debt securities which are not pledged to secure public funds. 
    
  The Company believes that it has sufficient funds and access to funds to meet its working capital and other needs. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Interest-Earning Assets, -Deposits, -Other Funding Sources and -Shareholders  Equity sections of this report for additional information regarding the Company s liquidity position. 

INFLATION 
    
  A banking organization s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary. Changes in the rate of inflation do not have as great an impact on the financial condition of a bank as do changes in interest rates. Moreover, interest rates do not necessarily change at the same percentage as inflation. Accordingly, changes in inflation are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. An analysis of the Company s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates. See  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks  section of this report for additional information. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
    
  This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Forward-looking information can be identified through the use of words such as  intend,   plan,   project,   expect,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   contemplate,   possible,   point,   will,   may,   should,   would  and  could.  Forward-looking statements and information are not historical facts, are premised on many factors and assumptions, and represent only management s expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events. Similarly, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, which may include, but are not limited to, those listed below and the Risk Factors discussed under Item 1A of the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any of the Company s subsequent SEC filings. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is including this statement for purposes of invoking these safe harbor provisions. Such forward-looking statements may be deemed to include, among other things, statements relating to the Company s future financial performance, the performance of its loan portfolio, the expected amount of future credit reserves and charge-offs, delinquency trends, growth plans, regulatory developments, securities that the Company may offer from time to time, and management s long-term performance goals, as well as statements relating to the anticipated effects on financial condition and results of operations from expected developments or events, the Company s business and growth strategies, including future acquisitions of banks, specialty finance or wealth management businesses, internal growth and plans to form additional de novo banks or branch offices. Actual results could differ materially from those addressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including the following: 

difficult economic conditions have adversely affected our company and the financial services industry in general and further deterioration in economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;  
                
    since our business is concentrated in the Chicago metropolitan and southern Wisconsin market areas, further declines in the economy of this region could adversely affect our business;  
                
    if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to absorb losses that may occur in our loan portfolio, our financial condition and liquidity could suffer;  
                
    a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, the repayment of which is largely dependent upon the financial success and economic viability of the borrower;  
                
    a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, in particular commercial real estate. Deterioration in the real estate markets could lead to additional losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations;  
                
    any inaccurate assumptions in our analytical and forecasting models could cause us to miscalculate our projected revenue or losses, which could adversely affect our financial condition;

unanticipated changes in prevailing interest rates and the effects of changing regulation could adversely affect our net interest income, which is our largest source of income; 
                
    our liquidity position may be negatively impacted if economic conditions continue to suffer; 
                
    the financial services industry is very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, we may lose market share and our business could suffer; 
                
    if we are unable to compete effectively, we will lose market share and income from deposits, loans and other products may be reduced. This could adversely affect our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
                
    if we are unable to continue to identify favorable acquisitions or successfully integrate our acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our results of operations could suffer; 
                
    our participation in FDIC-assisted acquisitions may present additional risks to our financial condition and results of operations; 
                
    an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength may cause others to reduce or cease doing business with us, which could result in a decrease in our net interest income and fee revenues; 
                
    if our growth requires us to raise additional capital, that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high; 
                
    disruption in the financial markets could result in lower fair values for our investment securities portfolio;

    we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information we receive about our customers and counterparties to make credit decisions; 
                
    if we are unable to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel, our ability to provide high quality service will be diminished, we may lose key customer relationships, and our results of operations may suffer; 
                
    we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities; 
                
    we are subject to claims and legal actions which could negatively affect our results of operations or financial condition; 
                
    losses incurred in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market may exceed our financial statement reserves and we may be required to increase such reserves in the future. Increases to our reserves and losses incurred in connection with actual loan repurchases and indemnification payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows;

    regulatory initiatives regarding bank capital requirements may require heightened capital; 
                
    our FDIC insurance premiums may increase, which could negatively impact our results of operations;

ITEM 3 
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
    
  As an ongoing part of its financial strategy, the Company attempts to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. This effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield. Asset-liability management policies are established and monitored by management in conjunction with the boards of directors of the banks, subject to general oversight by the Risk Management Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. The policies establish guidelines for acceptable limits on the sensitivity of the market value of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. 
    
  Interest rate risk arises when the maturity or re-pricing periods and interest rate indices of the interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities, and derivative financial instruments are different. It is the risk that changes in the level of market interest rates will result in disproportionate changes in the value of, and the net earnings generated from, the Company s interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The Company continuously monitors not only the organization s current net interest margin, but also the historical trends of these margins. In addition, management attempts to identify potential adverse changes in net interest income in future years as a result of interest rate fluctuations by performing simulation analysis of various interest rate environments. If a potential adverse change in net interest margin and/or net income is identified, management would take appropriate actions with its asset-liability structure to mitigate these potentially adverse situations. 
    
  Since the Company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is from customer deposits, the Company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and local competition in the market areas in which the banks operate. The rates, terms and interest rate indices of the Company s interest earning assets result primarily from the Company s strategy of investing in loans and securities that permit the Company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk, together with credit risk, while at the same time achieving an acceptable interest rate spread. 
    
  The Company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a regular basis by management and the Risk Management Committees of the boards of directors of the banks and the Company. The objective of the review is to measure the effect on net income and to adjust balance sheet and derivative financial instruments to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximize net interest income. 
    
  The following interest rate scenarios display the percentage change in net interest income over a one-year time horizon assuming increases of 100 and 200 basis points and decreases of 100 basis points. The Static Shock Scenario results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments following an instantaneous, parallel change in market rates based upon a static (i.e. no growth or constant) balance sheet. Conversely, the Ramp Scenario results incorporate management s projections of future volume and pricing of each of the product lines following a gradual, parallel change in market rates over twelve months. Actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies. The interest rate sensitivity for both the Static Shock and Ramp Scenarios at   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   is as follows: 

One method utilized by financial institutions, including the Company, to manage interest rate risk is to enter into derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, futures, forwards, option contracts and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. Additionally, the Company enters into commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery  
  
   92 

     Table of Contents  

of mortgage loans to third party investors. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for further information on the Company s derivative financial instruments. 
    
  During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, the Company entered into certain covered call option transactions related to certain securities held by the Company. The Company uses these option transactions (rather than entering into other derivative interest rate contracts, such as interest rate floors) to economically hedge positions and compensate for net interest margin compression by increasing the total return associated with the related securities through fees generated from these options. Although the revenue received from these options is recorded as non-interest income rather than interest income, the increased return attributable to the related securities from these options contributes to the Company s overall profitability. The Company s exposure to interest rate risk may be impacted by these transactions. To mitigate this risk, the Company may acquire fixed rate term debt or use financial derivative instruments. There were no covered call options outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .

ITEM 4 
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation under their supervision, with the participation of other members of management as they deemed appropriate, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as contemplated by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, in all material respects, in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (and its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the periodic reports the Company is required to file and submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act. 
    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the period that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II   

Item 1: Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries, from time to time, are subject to pending and threatened legal action and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. 
    
  In accordance with applicable accounting principles, the Company establishes an accrued liability for litigation and threatened litigation actions and proceedings when those actions present loss contingencies which are both probable and estimable. In actions for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, the Company determines whether it can estimate a loss or range of possible loss. To determine whether a possible loss is estimable, the Company reviews and evaluates its material litigation on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. This review may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on substantive or dispositive motions, and settlement discussions. 
    
  On January 15, 2015, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. ("Lehman Holdings") sent a demand letter asserting that Wintrust Mortgage must indemnify it for losses arising from loans sold by Wintrust Mortgage to Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB under a Loan Purchase Agreement between Wintrust Mortgage, as successor to SGB Corporation, and Lehman Brothers Bank. The demand was the precursor for triggering the alternative dispute resolution process mandated by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Lehman Holdings triggered the mandatory alternative dispute resolution process on October 16, 2015. On February 3, 2016, following a ruling by the federal Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that was adverse to Lehman Holdings on the statute of limitations that is applicable to similar loan purchase claims, Lehman Holdings filed a complaint against Wintrust Mortgage and 150 other entities from which it had purchased loans in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The mandatory mediation was held on March 16, 2016, but did not result in a consensual resolution of the dispute. Wintrust Mortgage will be required to respond to the complaint after the Court's entry of a scheduling order, which has not yet occurred.  
    
  The Company has reserved an amount for the Lehman Holdings action that is immaterial to its results of operations or financial condition. Such litigation and threatened litigation actions necessarily involve substantial uncertainty and it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate resolution or to determine whether, or to what extent, any loss with respect to these legal proceedings may exceed the amounts reserved by the Company. 
    
  On August 28, 2015, Wintrust Mortgage received a demand from RFC Liquidating Trust asserting that Wintrust Mortgage is liable to it for losses arising from loans sold by Wintrust Mortgage or its predecessors to Residential Funding Company LLC and/or related entities. No litigation has been initiated and the range of liability is not reasonably estimable at this time and it is not foreseeable when sufficient information will become available to provide a basis for recording a reserve, should a reserve ultimately be required. 
    
  On August 13, 2015, BMO Harris Financial Advisors ( BHFA ) filed an arbitration demand with the FINRA seeking damages and a permanent injunction and a complaint with the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois seeking a temporary restraining order against one of its former financial advisors and a current financial advisor with WHI. A narrow and limited temporary injunction was entered and the matter was referred to FINRA for arbitration. In November 2015, BHFA added WHI as a co-defendant in the arbitration action, alleging that WHI tortiously interfered with BHFA s contract with its former financial advisor. A hearing on the merits was held on September 12 - 15, 2016. On October 11, 2016, the FINRA panel issued a damages award against WHI for $1,537,500. 
    
  Based on information currently available and upon consultation with counsel, management believes that the eventual outcome of any pending or threatened legal actions and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial condition of the Company. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations or financial condition for a particular period.
