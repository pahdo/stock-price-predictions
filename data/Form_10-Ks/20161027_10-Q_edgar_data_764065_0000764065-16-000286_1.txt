  NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  The accompanying   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements   have been prepared in accordance with SEC rules and regulations and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly, the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for the periods presented.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions.  The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or any other future period.  These   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements   should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  As more fully described in the Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we announced in January 2015, that the Bloom Lake Group commenced CCAA proceedings (the "Bloom Filing") with the Quebec Superior Court (Commercial Division) in Montreal (the "Montreal Court").  Effective January 27, 2015, following the Bloom Filing, we deconsolidated the Bloom Lake Group and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries comprising substantially all of our Canadian operations.  Additionally, on May 20, 2015, the Wabush Group commenced CCAA proceedings (the "Wabush Filing") in the Montreal Court, which resulted in the deconsolidation of the remaining Wabush Group entities that were not previously deconsolidated.  Financial results prior to the respective deconsolidations of the Bloom Lake and Wabush Groups and subsequent expenses directly associated with the Canadian Entities are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations.  
  Also, for the majority of 2015, we operated   two   metallurgical coal operations in Alabama and West Virginia.  In December 2015, we completed the sale of these   two   metallurgical coal operations, which marked our exit from the coal business.  As of March 31, 2015, management determined that our North American Coal operating segment met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under   ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements  .  As such, all presented North American Coal operating segment results are included and classified within discontinued operations in our financial statements.  
  Refer to NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS for further discussion of the Eastern Canadian Iron Ore and North American Coal segment's discontinued operations. 
  We report our results from continuing operations in two reportable segments: U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore. 
  Basis of Consolidation 
  The   unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements   include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, including the following operations as of   September 30, 2016  :

Equity Method Investments 
  Our   23 percent   ownership interest in Hibbing is recorded as an equity method investment.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our investment in Hibbing was   $1.9 million   and   $2.4 million  , respectively, classified as   Other liabilities   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position  . 
  Foreign Currency 
    Our financial statements are prepared with the U.S. dollar as the reporting currency.  The functional currency of our Australian subsidiaries is the Australian dollar.  The functional currency of all other international subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.  The financial statements of international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a weighted average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses, gains and losses.  Where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments are recorded as   Accumulated other comprehensive loss  .  Income taxes generally are not provided for foreign currency translation adjustments.  To the extent that monetary assets and liabilities, inclusive of intercompany notes, are recorded in a currency other than the functional currency, these amounts are remeasured each reporting period, with the resulting gain or loss being recorded in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations  .  Transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement of short-term intercompany loans are included in   Miscellaneous - net   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations  .   
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred a net loss of   $0.3 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively, from the impact of transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement.  Of these amounts, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , losses of   $1.1 million   and gains of   $0.6 million   and for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , gains of   $0.3 million   and losses of   $2.0 million   resulted from remeasurement of cash and cash equivalents and remeasurement of certain obligations, respectively.  
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , net gains of   $2.4 million   and   $15.2 million  , respectively, related to the impact of transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement.  Of these amounts, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , gains of   $0.1 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively, resulted from remeasurement of short-term intercompany loans and cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, of these amounts for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , gains of   $11.1 million   and   $2.0 million   resulted from remeasurement of short-term intercompany loans and cash and cash equivalents, respectively. 
  Significant Accounting Policies 
  A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed therein. 
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
    Issued and Not Effective 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases.  The new standard requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities for leases previously classified as operating leases.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  We are currently reviewing the guidance and assessing the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The new standard is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted.  We are currently reviewing the guidance and assessing the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Issued and Adopted 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The new standard addresses eight specific changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.  We have adopted the guidance for the period ended September 30, 2016 and have applied this amended accounting guidance to the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows   for all periods presented.  The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have an impact on prior results reported in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows  .

NOTE 2 - SEGMENT REPORTING 
  Our continuing operations are organized and managed according to geographic location: U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore.  Our U.S. Iron Ore segment is a major supplier of iron ore pellets to the North American steel industry from our mines and pellet plants located in Michigan and Minnesota.  The Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment is located in Western Australia and provides iron ore to the seaborne market for Asian steel producers. There were no intersegment revenues in the first nine months of 2016 or 2015. 
  We have historically evaluated segment performance based on sales margin, defined as revenues less cost of goods sold, and operating expenses identifiable to each segment.  Additionally,   we evaluate segment performance based on the key indicators of EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA excluding certain items such as impacts of impairment of other long-lived assets, discontinued operations, extinguishment/restructuring of debt, severance and contractor termination costs, foreign currency remeasurement, and intersegment corporate allocations of SG A costs.  These measures allow management and investors to focus on our ability to service our debt, as well as, illustrate how the business and each operating segment is performing.  Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA assist management and investors in their analysis and forecasting as these measures approximate the cash flows associated with operational earnings.      
  The following tables present a summary of our reportable segments for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , including a reconciliation of segment sales margin to   Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes   and a reconciliation of   Net Income (Loss)   to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

As a result, we recorded a   $19.9 million   pre-tax loss on full retirement of long-term debt in the third quarter of 2016, which consisted of debt redemption premiums of   $17.4 million   and expenses of   $2.5 million   related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, unamortized bond discount and deferred losses on interest rate swaps.  The loss was recorded against the   Gain (Loss) on extinguishment/restructuring of debt   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  $218.5 million 8.00 percent 2020 Senior Secured 1.5 Lien Notes - 2016 Exchange Offers 
  On March 2, 2016, we entered into an indenture among the Company, the guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and notes collateral agent, relating to our issuance of   $218.5 million   aggregate principal amount of   8.00 percent   1.5 Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the  1.5 Lien Notes ). The 1.5 Lien Notes were issued on March 2, 2016 in exchange offers for certain of our existing senior notes.  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

The 1.5 Lien Notes bear interest at a rate of   8.00 percent   per annum. Interest on the 1.5 Lien Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 31 and September 30 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2016. The 1.5 Lien Notes mature on September 30, 2020 and are secured senior obligations of the Company. 
  The 1.5 Lien Notes are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by substantially all of our material U.S. subsidiaries and are secured (subject in each case to certain exceptions and permitted liens) on (i) a junior first-priority basis by substantially all of our U.S. assets, other than the ABL collateral (the "Notes Collateral"), which secures the   8.25 percent   senior first lien notes due 2020 (the "First Lien Notes") obligations on a senior first-priority basis, the   7.75 percent   senior second lien notes due 2020 (the "Second Lien Notes") obligations on a second-priority basis and the ABL Facility obligations on a third-priority basis, and (ii) a junior second-priority basis by our ABL collateral, which secures our ABL obligations on a first-priority basis, the First Lien Notes obligations on a senior second-priority basis and the Second Lien Notes obligations on a third-priority basis. 
  The terms of the 1.5 Lien Notes are governed by the 1.5 Lien Notes indenture. The 1.5 Lien Notes indenture contains customary covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur certain secured indebtedness, create liens on principal property and the capital stock or debt of a subsidiary that owns a principal property, use proceeds of dispositions of collateral, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another company and transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Upon the occurrence of a  change of control triggering event,  as defined in the 1.5 Lien Notes indenture, we are required to offer to repurchase the 1.5 Lien Notes at   101 percent   of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. 
  We may redeem any of the 1.5 Lien Notes beginning on September 30, 2017. The initial redemption price is   104 percent   of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The redemption price will decline after September 30, 2017 and will be   100 percent   of its principal amount, plus accrued interest, beginning on September 30, 2019. We may also redeem some or all of the 1.5 Lien Notes at any time and from time to time prior to September 30, 2017 at a price equal to   100 percent   of the principal amount thereof plus a  make-whole  premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, at any time and from time to time on or prior to September 30, 2017, we may redeem in the aggregate up to   35 percent   of the original aggregate principal amount of the 1.5 Lien Notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional 1.5 Lien Notes) with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings, at a redemption price of   108 percent  , plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, so long as at least   65 percent   of the original aggregate principal amount of the 1.5 Lien Notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional 1.5 Lien Notes) issued under the 1.5 Lien Notes indenture remain outstanding after each such redemption. 
  The 1.5 Lien Notes indenture contains customary events of default, including failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, failure to pay or acceleration of certain other indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the 1.5 Lien Notes indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least   25 percent   in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding 1.5 Lien Notes issued under the 1.5 Lien Notes indenture to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the amounts due under the 1.5 Lien Notes. 
  We accounted for the 1.5 Lien Notes exchange as a TDR.  For an exchange classified as TDR, if the future undiscounted cash flows of the newly issued debt are less than the net carrying value of the original debt, the carrying value of the newly issued debt is adjusted to the future undiscounted cash flow amount, a gain is recorded for the difference and no future interest expense is recorded.  All future interest payments on the newly issued debt reduce the carrying value.  Accordingly, we recognized a gain of   $174.3 million   in the   Gain (loss) on extinguishment/restructuring of debt   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  As a result, our reported interest expense will be less than the contractual interest payments throughout the term of the 1.5 Lien Notes.  Debt issuance costs incurred of   $5.2 million   related to the notes exchange were expensed and were included in the   Gain (loss) on extinguishment/restructuring of debt   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Letters of Credit 
  We issued standby letters of credit with certain financial institutions in order to support business obligations including, but not limited to, workers compensation and environmental obligations.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these letter of credit obligations totaled   $108.8 million   and   $186.3 million  , respectively.

Debt Maturities 
  The following represents a summary of our maturities of debt instruments, excluding borrowings on the ABL Facility, based on the principal amounts outstanding at   September 30, 2016  :  

NOTE 6 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS    
  We have various financial instruments that require fair value measurements classified as Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The following discussion represents the assets and liabilities measured at fair value at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  . 
  There were   no   Level 1 financial assets as of   September 30, 2016  . Financial assets classified in Level 1 as of   December 31, 2015  , include money market funds of   $30.0 million  . The valuation of these instruments is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. 
  The derivative financial assets classified within Level 3 at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   primarily relate to a freestanding derivative instrument related to certain supply agreements with one of our U.S. Iron Ore customers.  The agreements include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer s annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnaces.  We account for this provision as a derivative instrument at the time of sale and adjust this provision to fair value as an adjustment to   Product revenues   each reporting period until the product is consumed and the amounts are settled.  The fair value of the instrument is determined using a market approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot-rolled coil at the steelmaker s facilities, and takes into consideration current market conditions and nonperformance risk. 
  The Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities also consisted of derivatives related to certain provisional pricing arrangements with our U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  These provisional pricing arrangements specify provisional price calculations, where the pricing mechanisms generally are based on market pricing, with the final revenue rate to be based on market inputs at a specified point in time in the future, per the terms of the supply agreements.  The difference between the estimated final revenue at the date of sale and the estimated final revenue rate is characterized as a derivative and is required to be accounted for separately once the revenue has been recognized.  The derivative instrument is adjusted to fair value through   Product revenues   each reporting period based upon current market data and forward-looking estimates provided by management until the final revenue rate is determined.

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our provisional pricing arrangements is management s estimate of   62 percent   Fe fines spot price based upon current market data, including historical seasonality and forward-looking estimates determined by management.  Significant increases or decreases in this input would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively. 
  The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our customer supply agreement is the future hot-rolled coil price that is estimated based on projections provided by the customer, current market data, analysts' projections and forward-looking estimates determined by management.  Significant increases or decreases in this input would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively. 
  We recognize any transfers between levels as of the beginning of the reporting period.  There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  .  The following tables represent a reconciliation of the changes in fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  The carrying amount for certain financial instruments (e.g.,   Accounts receivable, net  ,   Accounts payable   and   Accrued expenses  ) approximates fair value and, therefore, has been excluded from the table below.  A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of other financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

NOTE 7 - PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS     
  We offer defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and OPEB plans, primarily consisting of retiree healthcare benefits, to most employees in the United States as part of a total compensation and benefits program. We do not have employee retirement benefit obligations at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations. The defined benefit pension plans largely are noncontributory and benefits generally are based on employees  years of service and average earnings for a defined period prior to retirement or a minimum formula. 
  Historically, we selected a single-weighted discount rate to be used for all pension and OPEB plans based on the 10th to 90th percentile results.  Beginning January 1, 2016, we elected to select a separate discount rate for each plan, based on 40th to 90th percentile results.  The discount rates are determined by matching the projected cash flows used to determine the projected benefit obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to a projected yield curve of 688 Aa graded bonds.  These bonds are either noncallable or callable with make-whole provisions.  We made this change in order to more precisely measure our service and interest costs, by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates.  As this change is treated as a change in estimate, the impact is reflected in the first nine months of the current fiscal year and prospectively, and historical measurements of service and interest cost were not affected.  
  This change in estimate is anticipated to reduce our current year annual net periodic benefit expense by approximately   $8.2 million   for our pension plans and by approximately   $1.8 million   for our OPEB plans.  Accordingly, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , total service cost and interest cost for the defined benefit pension plans were   $12.0 million   and   $35.9 million  , respectively, a reduction of   $1.9 million   and   $6.1 million  , respectively, as a result of implementing the new approach.  
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , total service cost and interest cost for the OPEB plans were   $2.7 million   and   $8.1 million  , respectively, a reduction of   $0.2 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively, as a result of implementing the new approach. 
  The following are the components of defined benefit pension and OPEB expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 
  Defined Benefit Pension Expense

Other Postretirement Benefits Expense 

We made pension contributions of   $0.5 million   and   $0.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to pension contributions of   $23.9 million   and   $34.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  OPEB contributions are typically made on an annual basis in the first quarter of each year, but due to plan funding requirements being met,   no   OPEB contributions were required or made for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
   
  NOTE 8 - STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS    
    Employees  Plans 
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors approved grants under the 2015 Equity Plan of   3.4 million   restricted share units to certain officers and employees with a grant date of February 23, 2016.  The restricted share units granted under this award are subject to continued employment through the vesting date of December 31, 2018.  
   
  NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES 
  Our 2016 estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items is approximately   0.4 percent  .  The annual effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of   35 percent   primarily due to deductions for percentage depletion in excess of cost depletion related to U.S. operations, a deduction for worthless stock and the placement of valuation  allowance from operations in the current year.  The 2015 estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items at September 30, 2015 was   2.1 percent  .  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded discrete items that resulted in an income tax benefit of   $2.9 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively.  These items relate primarily to prior year adjustments due to a change in estimate of the 2015 net operating loss and corresponding reversal of valuation allowance and quarterly interest accrued on reserves for uncertain tax positions.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , there were discrete items that resulted in an income tax benefit of   $4.5 million   and income tax expense of   $162.6 million  , respectively.  These items were related primarily to the recording of valuation allowances against existing deferred tax assets as a result of the determination that these would no longer be realizable.

NOTE 10 - LEASE OBLIGATIONS    
  We lease certain mining, production and other equipment under operating and capital leases.  The capital leases are for varying lengths, generally at market interest rates and contain purchase and/or renewal options at the end of the terms.  Our operating lease expense was   $2.2 million   and   $6.8 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   $3.2 million   and   $9.5 million  , respectively, for the same periods in   2015  . 
  Future minimum payments under capital leases and non-cancellable operating leases at   September 30, 2016   are as follows:

    The total is comprised of   $18.3 million   and   $45.5 million   classified as   Other current liabilities   and   Other liabilities  , respectively, in the Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position at   September 30, 2016  . 
      
  NOTE 11 - ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS    
  We had environmental and mine closure liabilities of   $222.8 million   and   $234.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The following is a summary of the obligations as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Mine Closure 
  The accrued closure obligation for our active mining operations provides for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations.  The accretion of the liability and amortization of the related asset is recognized over the estimated mine lives for each location.

The revisions in the estimated cash flows recorded during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   relate primarily to revisions of the timing of the estimated cash flows related to one of our U.S. mines.  For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the revisions in estimated cash flows recorded during the year related primarily to revisions in the timing of the estimated cash flows and the technology associated with required storm water management systems expected to be implemented subsequent to the indefinite idling of the Empire mine. 
   
  NOTE 12 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES    
  Goodwill 
  The carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   year ended     December 31, 2015   was   $2.0 million   and related to our U.S. Iron Ore operating segment.

Amortization expense relating to intangible assets was   $0.9 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively, for the comparable periods in 2015.  The estimated amortization expense relating to intangible assets for the remainder of this year and each of the five succeeding years is as follows: 

The below-market sales contract is classified as a liability and recognized over the term of the underlying contract, which expires December 31, 2016.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $7.7 million   and   $15.4 million  , respectively, in   Product revenues   related to the below-market sales contract. The remaining   $7.7 million   is estimated to be recognized in   Product revenues   during the remainder of 2016.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
    Customer Supply Agreements 
  Most of our U.S. Iron Ore long-term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors.  The base price is the primary component of the purchase price for each contract.  The indexed price adjustment factors are integral to the iron ore supply contracts and vary based on the agreement, but typically include adjustments based upon changes in specified price indices, including those for industrial commodities, energy and cold rolled steel and changes in the Platts IODEX.  The pricing adjustments generally operate in the same manner, with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment, although the weighting of each factor varies based upon the specific terms of each agreement.  In most cases, these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold.  In these cases, we historically have estimated the adjustment factors at each reporting period based upon the best  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

third-party information available.  The estimates are then adjusted to actual when the information has been finalized.  The price adjustment factors have been evaluated to determine if they contain embedded derivatives.  The price adjustment factors share the same economic characteristics and risks as the host contract and are integral to the host contract as inflation adjustments; accordingly, they have not been separately valued as derivative instruments.  Certain of our term supply agreements contain price collars, which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our products during any given year. 
  A certain supply agreement with one U.S. Iron Ore customer provides for supplemental revenue or refunds to the customer based on the customer s average annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnace.  The supplemental pricing is characterized as a freestanding derivative and is required to be accounted for separately once the product is shipped.  The derivative instrument, which is finalized based on a future price, is adjusted to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled.   
  We recognized a   $7.1 million   and   $26.8 million   net gain in   Product revenues   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to the supplemental payments.  This compares with   Product revenues   of   $11.6 million   and   $22.1 million   for the comparable periods in   2015  .    Other current assets  , representing the fair value of the pricing factors, were   $28.0 million   and   $5.8 million   in the   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position  , respectively. 
    Provisional Pricing Arrangements 
  Certain of our U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore customer supply agreements specify provisional price calculations, where the pricing mechanisms generally are based on market pricing, with the final revenue rate to be based on market inputs at a specified period in time in the future, per the terms of the supply agreements.  U.S. Iron Ore sales revenue primarily is recognized when cash is received.  For U.S. Iron Ore sales, the difference between the provisionally agreed-upon price and the estimated final revenue rate is characterized as a freestanding derivative and must be accounted for separately once the provisional revenue has been recognized.  Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales revenue is initially recorded at the provisionally agreed-upon price with the pricing provision embedded in the receivable.  The pricing provision is an embedded derivative that must be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the receivable.  Subsequently, the derivative instruments for both U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore are adjusted to fair value through   Product revenues   each reporting period based upon current market data and forward-looking estimates provided by management until the final revenue rate is determined.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we recorded   $0.4 million   with our U.S. Iron Ore customers and   $2.0 million   with our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers, respectively, as   Other current assets   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position   related to our estimate of the final revenue rate.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we recorded   $2.7 million   with our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers and   $3.4 million   with our U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers, respectively, as   Other current liabilities   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position   related to our estimate of the final revenue rate.  These amounts represent the difference between the provisional price agreed upon with our customers based on the supply agreement terms and our estimate of the final revenue rate based on the price calculations established in the supply agreements.  As a result, we recognized a   $4.5 million   and   $22.9 million   net increase in   Product revenues   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to these arrangements. This compares with a net   $7.6 million   increase and a net   $0.2 million   decrease in   Product revenues     for the comparable periods in 2015.

North American Coal Operations 
  Loss on Discontinued Operations 
  Our previously reported North American Coal operating segment results are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  The closing of the sale of our Oak Grove and Pinnacle mines on December 22, 2015, completed a strategic shift in our business.

Income Taxes    
  We recognized   no   tax benefit or expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 in   Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax  , related to our North American Coal investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a tax benefit of   $2.1 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively, in   Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax  .   This benefit was primarily the result of a loss on our North American Coal investments. 
  Canadian Operations 
  Status of CCAA Proceedings 
  On March 8, 2016, certain of the Canadian Entities completed the sale of their port and rail assets located in Pointe-Noire, Quebec to Societe Ferroviaire et Portuaire de Pointe-Noire S.E.C., an affiliate of Investissement Quebec, for CAD  $66.75 million   in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. 
  On April 11, 2016, certain of the Canadian Entities completed the sale of the Bloom Lake Mine and Labrador Trough South mineral claims located in Quebec, as well as certain rail assets located in Newfoundland   Labrador, to Quebec Iron Ore Inc., an affiliate of Champion Iron Mines Limited, for CAD  $10.5 million   in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities.  
  After payment of sale expenses and taxes and repayment of the DIP financing, the net proceeds from these and certain other divestitures by the Canadian Entities are currently being held by the Monitor, on behalf of the Canadian Entities, to fund the costs of the CCAA proceedings and for eventual distribution to creditors of the Canadian Entities pending further order of the Montreal Court.

Gain (Loss) on Discontinued Operations  
  Our decision in 2015 to exit Canada represented a strategic shift in our business.  For this reason, our previously reported Eastern Canadian Iron Ore and Ferroalloys operating segment results for all periods prior to the respective 2015 deconsolidations as well as costs to exit are classified as discontinued operations. 

Canadian Entities loss from deconsolidation totaled   $0.9 million   and gain from deconsolidation totaled   $3.2 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which included the following: 

We have   no   gain or loss from deconsolidation attributable to contingent liabilities for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a gain of   $0.5 million   and a loss of   $203.1 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  As a result of the deconsolidation we recorded accrued expenses for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against us, primarily under guarantees of certain debt arrangements and leases for a loss on deconsolidation of   $203.1 million  , for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Investments in the Canadian Entities 
    Cliffs continues to indirectly own a majority of the interest in the Canadian Entities but has deconsolidated those entities because Cliffs no longer has a controlling interest as a result of the Bloom Filing and the Wabush Filing.  At the respective date of deconsolidation, January 27, 2015 or May 20, 2015 and subsequently at each reporting period, we adjusted our investment in the Canadian Entities to fair value with a corresponding charge to   Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax  .  As the estimated amount of the Canadian Entities' liabilities exceeded the estimated fair value of the assets available for distribution to its creditors, the fair value of Cliffs  equity investment is approximately   zero  .  
  Amounts Receivable from the Canadian Entities 
  Prior to the deconsolidations, various Cliffs wholly-owned entities made loans to the Canadian Entities for the purpose of funding its operations and had accounts receivable generated in the ordinary course of business.  The loans, corresponding interest and the accounts receivable were considered intercompany transactions and eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.  Since the deconsolidations, the loans, associated interest and accounts receivable are considered related party transactions and have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements at their

estimated fair value of   $69.3 million   and   $72.9 million   in the Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
    Contingent Liabilities 
     Certain liabilities consisting primarily of equipment loans and environmental obligations of the Canadian Entities were secured through corporate guarantees and standby letters of credit.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have liabilities of   $0.2 million   and   $37.9 million  , respectively, in our consolidated results, classified as   Guarantees   and   Other liabilities   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position  .  As of December 31, 2015, we had liabilities of   $96.5 million   and   $35.9 million  , respectively, in our consolidated results, classified as   Guarantees   and   Other liabilities   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position  .  
    Contingencies  
  The recorded expenses include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against us, primarily under guarantees of certain debt arrangements and leases.  The beneficiaries of those guarantees may seek damages or other related relief as a result of our exit from Canada.  Our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation that claims will be asserted against us and negotiated settlements will be reached, and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable were these claims to be litigated.  Our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the Canadian Entities.  We are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in excess of the accrual because there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved.  We believe that it is reasonably possible that future changes to our estimates of loss and the ultimate amount paid on these claims could be material to our results of operations in future periods.  Any such losses would be reported in discontinued operations. 
  Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis   
  The following table presents information about the financial assets and liabilities that were measured on a fair value basis at   September 30, 2016   for the Canadian Operations.

We determined the fair value and recoverability of our Canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the remaining underlying assets of the Canadian Entities to remaining estimated liabilities.  We recorded the contingent liabilities at book value which best approximated fair value. 
  Outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities, forward commitments, unsubordinated related party payables, lease liabilities and other potential claims.  Potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the Bloom Lake Group and Wabush Group under certain contracts. Claimants may seek damages or other related relief as a result of the Canadian Entities' exit from Canada.  Based on our estimates, the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets.  
  To assess the fair value and recoverability of the amounts receivable from the Canadian Entities, we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the Canadian Entities available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims.

     Table of Contents  

Our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments made by the Canadian Entities.  Our ultimate recovery is subject to the final liquidation value of the Canadian Entities.  Further, the final liquidation value and ultimate recovery of the creditors of the Canadian Entities, including Cliffs Natural Resources and various subsidiaries, may impact our estimates of contingent liability exposure described previously.  
  DIP Financing 
  In connection with the Wabush Filing on May 20, 2015, the Montreal Court approved an agreement to provide a debtor-in-possession credit facility (the "DIP financing") to the Wabush Group, which provided for borrowings under the facility up to   $10.0 million  .  The DIP financing was secured by a court-ordered charge over the assets of the Wabush Group.  As of December 31, 2015, there was   $6.8 million   drawn and outstanding under the DIP financing funded by Wabush Iron Co. Limited s parent company, Cliffs Mining Company.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Wabush Group made an additional draw of   $1.5 million  .  We subsequently received a repayment of   $8.3 million   and as a result, there was   no   outstanding balance due under the DIP financing arrangement from Wabush Iron Co. Limited s parent company, Cliffs Mining Company as of September 30, 2016. 
  Income Taxes    
  We recognized   no   tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 in   Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax  . For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a tax expense of   $0.7 million   in   Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax  .    We recognized   no   tax benefit or expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in   Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax  . 
   
  NOTE 15 - CAPITAL STOCK    
  Preferred Shares Conversion to Common Shares 
  On January 4, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors determined the final quarterly dividend of our Preferred Shares would not be paid in cash, but instead, pursuant to the terms of the Preferred Shares, the conversion rate was increased such that holders of the Preferred Shares received additional common shares in lieu of the accrued dividend at the time of the mandatory conversion of the Preferred Shares on February 1, 2016.  The number of our common shares in the aggregate issued in lieu of the dividend was   1.3 million  .  This resulted in an effective conversion rate of   0.9052   common shares, rather than   0.8621   common shares, per depositary share, each representing 1/40   th    of a Preferred Share.  Upon conversion on February 1, 2016, an aggregate of   26.5 million   common shares were issued, representing   25.2 million   common shares issuable upon conversion and   1.3 million   that were issued in lieu of a final cash dividend. 
  Debt for Equity Exchange 
  During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement whereby we issued an aggregate of   2.3 million   common shares, representing less than one percent of our outstanding common shares, in exchange for   $4.5 million   aggregate principal amount of our 4.80 percent senior notes due 2020 and   $10.5 million   aggregate principal amount of our 4.875 percent senior notes due 2021.  Accordingly, we recognized a gain of   $1.6 million   in   Gain (loss) on extinguishment/restructuring of debt   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The issuance of the common shares in exchange for our senior notes due 2020 and 2021 was made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, we entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement whereby we issued an aggregate of   1.8 million   common shares, representing less than one percent of our outstanding common shares, in exchange for   $12.6 million   aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due 2020.  Accordingly, we recognized a gain of   $3.6 million   in   Gain (loss) on extinguishment/restructuring of debt   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The issuance of the common shares in exchange for our senior notes due 2020 was made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.

  Common Share Public Offering 
  On August 10, 2016, we issued   44.4 million   common shares in a public offering.  We received net proceeds of approximately   $287.6 million   at a public offering price of   $6.75   per common share.  The proceeds from the issuance of our common shares were used to fully redeem our senior notes due 2018.

  NOTE 18 - RELATED PARTIES    
    Three   of our   five   U.S. iron ore mines are owned with various joint venture partners that are integrated steel producers or their subsidiaries.  We are the manager of each of the mines we co-own and rely on our joint venture partners to make their required capital contributions and to pay for their share of the iron ore pellets that we produce.  The joint venture partners are also our customers.  The following is a summary of the mine ownership of these iron ore mines at   September 30, 2016  : 

ArcelorMittal has a unilateral right to put its interest in the Empire mine to us, but has not exercised this right to date.  Furthermore, as part of the 2014 extension agreement that was entered into between us and ArcelorMittal, which amended certain terms of the Empire partnership agreement, certain minimum distributions of the partners  equity amounts are required to be made on a quarterly basis beginning in the first quarter of 2015 and will continue through the first quarter of 2017.  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded distributions of   $7.4 million   and   $48.8 million  , respectively, under this agreement of which   $41.4 million   was paid as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, we paid $11.1 million in January 2016 related to 2015 distributions. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded distributions of   $9.0 million   and   $40.7 million   under this agreement, of which   $31.7 million   was paid as of   September 30, 2015  .

NOTE 20 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
  Contingencies 
  Litigation 
  We are currently a party to various claims and legal proceedings incidental to our operations.  If management believes that a loss arising from these matters is probable and can reasonably be estimated, we record the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range, and no point within the range is more probable than another.  As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary.  Based on currently available information, management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur.  An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages, additional funding requirements or an injunction.  If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on the financial position and results of operations of the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods.  However, we do not believe that any pending litigation will result in a material liability in relation to our consolidated financial statements. Currently, we have  recorded a liability in   Accrued expenses   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position   related to the following matter: 
  Michigan Electricity Matters.    On February 19, 2015, in connection with various proceedings before FERC with respect to certain cost allocations for continued operation of the Presque Isle Power Plant in Marquette, Michigan, FERC issued an order directing MISO to submit a revised methodology for allocating SSR costs that identified the load serving entities that require the operation of SSR units at the power plant for reliability purposes.  On September 17, 2015, FERC issued an order conditionally approving MISO s revised allocation methodology.  On September 22, 2016, FERC denied requests for rehearing of the February 19 order, rejecting arguments that FERC did not have the authority to order refunds in a cost allocation case and to impose retroactive surcharges to effectuate such refunds.  FERC, however, suspended any refunds and surcharges pending its review of a July 25, 2016 ALJ initial decision on the appropriate amount of SSR compensation.  Should FERC award SSR costs based on retroactive surcharges and the amount of SSR compensation not be adjusted, our current estimate of the potential liability to the Empire and Tilden mines is approximately   $13.6 million  , based on MISO's June 14, 2016 refund report (as revised in MISO's July 20, 2016 errata refund report) for the Escanaba, White Pine and Presque Isle SSRs.  We, however, continue to vigorously challenge both the amount of the SSR compensation and the imposition of any SSR costs before FERC and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors that may affect our future results.  We believe it is important to read our MD A in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as other publicly available information. 
   
  Overview 
  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. is a leading mining and natural resources company in the United States. We are a major supplier of iron ore pellets to the North American steel industry from our mines and pellet plants located in Michigan and Minnesota. We also operate the Koolyanobbing iron ore mining complex in Western Australia. Driven by the core values of safety, social, environmental and capital stewardship, our employees endeavor to provide all stakeholders operating and financial transparency. 
  The key driver of our business is demand for steelmaking raw materials from U.S. steelmakers, which is heavily influenced by the global steel market and, in particular, Chinese steel production.  In the first nine months of 2016, the U.S. produced approximately 60 million metric tons of crude steel or about 5 percent of total global crude steel production, which is flat when compared to the same period in 2015.  U.S. total steel capacity utilization was approximately 72 percent in the first nine months of 2016, which is also flat compared to the same period in 2015.  Additionally, in the first nine months of 2016, China produced approximately 604 million metric tons of crude steel, or approximately 50 percent of total global crude steel production, which is flat when compared to the same period in 2015.  Through the first nine months of 2016, global crude steel production is flat compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Through the first nine months of 2016, the Platts IODEX has, despite its volatility, remained at encouraging levels. We believe this is the result of improved sentiment about steel demand in China and signs of high-cost capacity closures.  In addition, major supply additions from both Brazil and Australia anticipated to come online this year have experienced difficulties ramping up and completion dates have been further delayed. Furthermore, we believe the new management teams at the major Australian iron ore producers will show more supply discipline for the remainder of the year and through 2017, which could help maintain or even improve these current price levels. 
  The Platts IODEX price decreased   7 percent   to an average price of   $54 per metric ton   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the respective period of 2015; however, the average price of $54 per metric ton is up from the low of approximately $39 per metric ton we encountered in December 2015.  The spot price volatility impacts our realized revenue rates, particularly in our Asia Pacific Iron Ore business segment because its contracts correlate heavily to Platts IODEX pricing, and to a lesser extent certain of our U.S. Iron Ore contracts.  
  While iron ore prices remained at encouraging levels during the third quarter, we did see a substantial decline in the price of hot-rolled coil in the United States. While still remaining at a level considerably higher than its lows in January 2016, the price of hot-rolled coil dropped over $100 per short ton during the third quarter. We believe this is a result of attempts by China to circumvent anti-dumping and countervailing duties by using other countries as an intermediary, most notably Vietnam. This issue was addressed in late September with a circumvention case against Vietnam made by the domestic U.S. mills, who are seeking to impose duties on these imports as well. We also believe the price weakness is attributable to normal seasonality of the business, as well as the uncertain political environment in the United States with respect to the November Presidential election. As these uncertainties subside and trade case enforcement continues, we believe the hot-rolled coil pricing environment in the United States will improve. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated revenues were   $553.3 million   and net loss from continuing operations per diluted share was   $0.11  .  This compares with consolidated revenues of   $593.2 million   and net income from continuing operations per diluted share of   $0.19   for the comparable period in 2015. The net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was impacted negatively by an   $18.3 million   loss on extinguishment of debt versus a gain on extinguishment/restructuring of debt of   $79.2 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated revenues were   $1,355.0 million   and net income from continuing operations per diluted share was   $0.51  .  This compares with consolidated revenues of   $1,537.3 million   and net income from continuing operations per diluted share of   $0.87   for the comparable period in 2015.  Net income from continuing operations in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015, were impacted positively as a result of gains on the extinguishment/restructuring of debt of   $164.1 million   and   $392.9 million  ,

respectively.  Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were impacted negatively by income tax expense primarily due to the placement of a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets.  
  Strategy 
    The Company is Focused on our Core U.S. Iron Ore Business 
  We are the market-leading iron ore producer in the United States, supplying differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to the largest North America integrated steel producers.  We have the unique advantage of not only being a low cost producer of iron ore pellets in the U.S. market, but also having the technical expertise to create custom-made pellets for the specific blast furnaces that we supply.  Pricing structures contained in and the long-term supply provided by our existing contracts, along with our low-cost operating profile, positions U.S. Iron Ore as our most stable business.  We expect to continue to strengthen our U.S. Iron Ore operating cost profile through continuous operational improvements and disciplined capital allocation policies.  Strategically, we continue to develop various entry options into the EAF market.  As the EAF steel market continues to capture a growing share of the United States steel market, there is an opportunity for our iron ore to serve this market by providing pellets to the alternative metallics market to produce direct reduced iron, hot briquetted iron and/or pig iron.  In 2015, we produced and shipped a batch trial of DR-grade pellets, a source of lower silica iron units for the production of direct reduced iron.  In early 2016, we reached a significant milestone with positive results from the successful industrial trial of our DR-grade pellets.  While we are still in the early stages of developing our alternative metallic business, we believe the trial will open up a new opportunity for us to diversify our product mix and add new customers to our U.S. Iron Ore segment beyond the traditional blast furnace clientele.  Additionally, during 2016, we commenced construction of the necessary assets and infrastructure required to produce a specialized, super-flux pellet called "Mustang" at United Taconite in order to provide a customized pellet that meets our customer's pellet specification requirements.  
    Maintaining Discipline on Costs and Capital Spending and Improving our Financial Flexibility 
  We believe our ability to execute our strategy is dependent on our financial position; therefore, we remain focused on improving the strength of our balance sheet and creating financial flexibility to manage through lower demand for our products and volatility in commodity prices. We have developed a highly disciplined financial and capital expenditure plan with a focus on improving our cost profile and increasing long-term profitability. 
  Recent Developments 
  On August 10, 2016, we issued approximately 44.4 million common shares at a public offering price of $6.75 per share. Net proceeds from the public offering were $287.6 million, including underwriter commissions and other expenses.  On August 17, 2016, we announced that we would redeem the entirety of our outstanding 3.95 percent senior notes due 2018. The aggregate principal amount outstanding on these notes was $283.6 million. We made total payments to the holders of the senior notes in the amount of $301.0 million in aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid interest to date.  The 3.95 percent senior notes were redeemed in full on September 16, 2016.  
  On March 23, 2016, we announced the indefinite idle of the Empire mine.  We notified employees and government officials of layoffs resulting from the idle by issuing notices under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) on April 14, June 9, and August 15, 2016.  The Empire mine continued to produce iron ore pellets until it was indefinitely idled on August 3, 2016. We plan to continue shipping Empire's remaining pellets into 2017.  Empire's ongoing indefinite idle costs are now included in   Miscellaneous - net     within the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations  . 
  On September 29, 2016, the United Steelworkers ratified a new three-year labor agreement with the Company that covers employees at our Tilden and Empire mines in Michigan, and United Taconite and Hibbing Taconite mines in Minnesota.  The new contract is retroactively effective from October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2018.  The agreement included a signing bonus of $3.5 million, which is recorded within the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations  .

Business Segments 
  Our Company s primary continuing operations are organized and managed according to geographic location: U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore.  As of March 31, 2015, management determined that our North American Coal operating segment met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under   ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements  .  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we sold two low-volatile metallurgical coal operations, Pinnacle mine and Oak Grove mine, marking our exit from the coal business. The sale was completed on December 22, 2015.  As such, all presented North American Coal operating segment results are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations.   
  Additionally, as a result of the CCAA filing of the Bloom Lake Group on January 27, 2015, and the Wabush Group on May 20, 2015, we no longer have a controlling interest over the Bloom Lake Group and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries, and we no longer have a controlling interest over the Wabush Group. The Bloom Lake Group, Wabush Group and certain of each of their wholly-owned subsidiaries were previously reported as Eastern Canadian Iron Ore and Other reportable segments.  As such, we deconsolidated the Bloom Lake Group and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries as of January 27, 2015.  Additionally, as a result of the Wabush Filing on May 20, 2015, we deconsolidated certain Wabush Group wholly-owned subsidiaries effective May 20, 2015.  The wholly-owned subsidiaries deconsolidated effective May 20, 2015 are Wabush Group entities that were not deconsolidated as part of the deconsolidation effective January 27, 2015.  Financial results prior to the respective deconsolidations of the Bloom Lake and Wabush Groups and subsequent expenses directly associated with the Canadian Entities are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations.  
   
  Results of Operations   Consolidated 
    2016 Compared to 2015 
  The following is a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Revenues from Product Sales and Services 
  Sales revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $39.9 million  , or   6.7 percent  , from the comparable period in   2015  , which primarily was attributable to the decrease in sales volume.  Iron ore sales volumes from our U.S. Iron Ore operations decreased   313 thousand   long tons or a decrease of   $24.0 million   in revenue and our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations decreased   127 thousand   metric tons or a decrease in revenue of   $5.3 million  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . These decreases in sales volumes and revenue were mainly attributable to the termination of a customer contract in the fourth quarter of the prior year that was reinstated in June 2016, for nominations to begin in 2017 and customer dock space limitations, partially offset by additional short term contracts for fewer nominated tons.  Additionally, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , iron ore revenues from our U.S. Iron Ore operations decreased   $15.8 million   due to unfavorable pricing compared to the prior-year period.  This was offset partially by our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations that had increased revenue of   $11.2 million   due to favorable pricing compared to the prior-year period.  Our realized revenue rates during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 decreased   3.9 percent   and increased   9.9 percent   for our U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations, respectively.

Sales revenue for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $182.3 million  , or   11.9 percent  , from the comparable period in   2015  , which primarily was driven from our U.S. Iron Ore Operations as a result of lower sales volumes of   1,448 thousand   long tons equating to a decrease in revenue of   $117.5 million   and from lower pricing for a decrease of   $45.1 million  . The decrease in volume mainly was attributable to the termination of a customer contract in the fourth quarter of the prior year that was reinstated in June 2016, for nominations to begin in 2017, lower demand for two major customer contracts and partially offset by additional short term contracts for fewer nominated tons.  Lower pricing primarily was driven by the negative inflation of certain price indices, the reduction in the Platts IODEX price, and the impact of higher carryover pricing in the prior-year period than the 2016 period. 
  Refer to  Results of Operations   Segment Information  for additional information regarding the specific factors that impacted revenue during the period. 
  Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses 
    Cost of goods sold and operating expenses   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $467.9 million   and   $1,147.2 million  , which represented a decrease of   $70.2 million   and   $196.9 million  , respectively, or   13.0 percent   and   14.6 percent  , respectively, from the comparable prior-year periods.   
    Cost of goods sold and operating expenses   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased as a result of operational efficiencies and cost cutting efforts across each of our business units which reduced costs by $25.4 million.  Additionally, lower idle costs and lower iron ore sales volumes decreased costs by   $21.1 million   and $22.2 million, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2015.  These decreases in cost were offset partially by higher costs of   $4.5 million   for our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates.   
    Cost of goods sold and operating expenses   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased as a result of operational efficiencies and cost cutting efforts across each of our business units which reduced costs by $106.3 million.  Additionally, lower iron ore sales volumes and favorable foreign exchange rates decreased costs by $84.8 million and   $8.6 million  , respectively, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  These decreases in cost were offset partially by higher idle costs of   $22.2 million   compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Refer to    Results of Operations   Segment Information    for additional information regarding the specific factors that impacted our operating results during the period. 
  Other Operating Income (Expense) 
  The following is a summary of   other operating income (expense)   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Selling, general and administrative expenses   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased by   $8.7 million   and decreased by   $0.4 million  , respectively, from the comparable periods in 2015.  The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior-year period was driven by increased external services costs of $2.5 million in addition to increased staff costs of $4.0 million, which included $3.5 million of union signing bonuses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior-year period was driven by decreased external services costs of $3.8 million partially offset by an increase of $2.1 million of rent and operating lease expenses.

The following is a summary of   Miscellaneous - net   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Miscellaneous - net   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased by   $16.1 million   and   $32.7 million  , respectively, from the comparable periods in 2015.  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   there was an unfavorable consolidated impact of   $12.4 million   related to the FERC ruling on the Michigan Electricity Matters and   $8.2 million   of Empire idle costs related to the indefinite idle of the mine.  Additionally, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was an incremental unfavorable impact of   $2.7 million   due to the change in foreign exchange remeasurement of cash and cash equivalents and remeasurement of certain obligations.  These unfavorable impacts were offset partially by $7.1 million of bad debt expense related to one customer that was recorded in the third quarter of 2015.   
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was an incremental unfavorable impact of   $16.4 million   primarily driven by the gain of   $11.1 million   from the remeasurement of short-term intercompany loans during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Additionally, the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   was impacted favorably by   $7.6 million   of insurance recovery related to the clean-up of the Pointe Noire oil spill that occurred in September 2013, which was not repeated during 2016. These unfavorable impacts were offset partially by $7.1 million and $3.3 million of bad debt expense and impairment of other long-lived assets, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

     Table of Contents  

Interest expense for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was impacted favorably by $11.2 million and $6.6 million, respectively, versus the comparable prior periods as a result of the debt restructuring activities that occurred during March 2015 and March 2016.  These debt restructurings resulted in a net reduction of the outstanding principal balance of our senior notes.  Additionally, there was a $2.7 million favorable impact due to the reduction of equipment loans and a $1.4 million favorable impact due to the reduction of capital lease interest for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year to date period. 
  The loss on extinguishment/restructuring of debt for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $18.3 million  , primarily related to the redemption of our 3.95 percent senior notes due 2018 compared to a gain of   $79.2 million   related to debt restructuring activities that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The gain on extinguishment/restructuring of debt for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $164.1 million  , primarily related to the issuance of 1.5 Lien Notes through the exchange offer on March 2, 2016 compared to   $392.9 million   related to the corporate debt restructuring that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
  Refer to NOTE 5- DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES for further discussion. 
         Income Taxes 
  Our effective tax rate is impacted by permanent items, such as depletion and the relative mix of income we earn in various foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the U.S. statutory rate.  It also is affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period, but are not consistent from period to period.  The following represents a summary of our tax provision and corresponding effective rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

A reconciliation of the statutory rate to the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

42 

     Table of Contents  

Our tax provision for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was a benefit of   $1.7 million   and a negative   1.5 percent   effective tax rate compared with an expense of   $169.9 million   for the comparable prior-year period.  The decrease in the expense is due to the prior year recording of valuation allowances against existing deferred tax assets. 
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded discrete items that resulted in an income tax benefit of   $2.9 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively.  These items primarily relate to prior year adjustments due to a change in estimate of the 2015 net operating loss and corresponding reversal of valuation allowance and quarterly interest accrued on reserves for uncertain tax positions.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, there were discrete items that resulted in an income tax benefit of   $4.5 million   and an income tax expense of   $162.6 million  , respectively.  The year-to-date amount was largely related to the recording of valuation allowances against existing deferred tax assets as a result of the determination that they would no longer be realizable.  
  Our 2016 estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items is 0.4 percent.  This estimated annual effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to deductions for percentage depletion in excess of cost depletion related to U.S. operations, a deduction for worthless stock and the placement of valuation allowance from operations in the current year. 
    Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of   $0.6 million  , net of tax, attributable to a net loss of   $3.8 million  , for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily from certain disputes related to the sale of our North American Coal segment. This loss was offset partially by a gain from foreign currency remeasurement of our   Loans to and accounts receivable from the Canadian Entities   of   $3.2 million   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position  .  
  As of March 31, 2015, management determined that our North American Coal operating segment met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under ASC 205,   Presentation of Financial Statements  . As such, all current year and historical North American Coal operating segment results are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax related to the North American Coal segment was   $1.8 million   and   $3.8 million  , for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $29.8 million   and   $137.0 million   in the comparable prior periods. 
  In January 2015, we announced that the Bloom Lake Group commenced CCAA proceedings.  At that time, we had suspended Bloom Lake operations and for several months had been exploring options to sell certain of our Canadian assets, among other initiatives. Effective January 27, 2015, following the CCAA filing of the Bloom Lake Group, we deconsolidated the Bloom Lake Group and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries comprising substantially all of our Canadian operations. Additionally, on May 20, 2015, the Wabush Group commenced CCAA proceedings which resulted in the deconsolidation of the remaining Wabush Group entities that were not previously deconsolidated. The Wabush Group was no longer generating revenues and was not able to meet its obligations as they came due. As a result of this action, the CCAA protections granted to the Bloom Lake Group were extended to include the Wabush Group to facilitate the reorganization or divestiture of each of their businesses and operations. Financial results prior to the respective deconsolidations of the Bloom Lake and Wabush Groups and subsequent expenses directly associated with the Canadian Entities are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. The impact of discontinued operations, net of tax related to the deconsolidated Canadian Entities was a loss of   $0.9 million   and a gain of   $3.2 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax of   $14.1 million   and   $732.0 million  , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
  Noncontrolling Interest 
  Noncontrolling interest primarily is comprised of our consolidated, but less-than-wholly-owned subsidiary at our Empire mining venture and through the CCAA filing on January 27, 2015, the Bloom Lake operations.  The net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest of the Empire mining venture was   $2.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest of the Empire mining venture was   $23.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . This is compared to net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest of $4.6 million and net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest of $6.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  There was no net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest related to Bloom Lake for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  There was no net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest related to Bloom Lake for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest of $7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Results of Operations   Segment Information    
  We have historically evaluated segment performance based on sales margin, defined as revenues less cost of goods sold, and operating expenses identifiable to each segment.  Additionally,   we evaluate segment performance based on the key indicators of EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA excluding certain items such as impacts of impairment of other long-lived assets, discontinued operations, extinguishment/restructuring of debt, severance and contractor termination costs, foreign currency remeasurement, and intersegment corporate allocations of SG A costs.  These measures allow management and investors to focus on our ability to service our debt, as well as, illustrate how the business and each operating segment is performing.  Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA assist management and investors in their analysis and forecasting as these measures approximate the cash flows associated with operational earnings.   
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

     Table of Contents  

EBITDA for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   $58.5 million   and increased   $615.3 million  , respectively, on a consolidated basis, from the comparable periods in 2015.  The period-over-period change primarily was driven by the impact of our discontinued operations in addition to the impact from debt restructuring/extinguishment activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  Adjusted EBITDA increased   $1.8 million   and decreased   $17.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from the comparable period in 2015.  The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period primarily was attributable to the higher consolidated sales margin.  The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period primarily was attributable to an incremental unfavorable impact from foreign exchange remeasurement and Empire idle costs included within   Miscellaneous - net   within the Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations.  See further detail below for additional information regarding the specific factors that impacted each reportable segments' sales margin during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
   
    2016   Compared to   2015    
  U.S. Iron Ore 
  The following is a summary of U.S. Iron Ore results for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Sales margin for U.S. Iron Ore was   $66.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with sales margin of   $48.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase compared to the prior-

     Table of Contents  

year period is attributable to a decrease in cost of goods sold and operating expenses of   $60.5 million   partially offset by lower revenue of   $42.7 million  .  Sales margin per long ton increased   44.5   percent to   $12.57   per long ton in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
    Revenue decreased by   $39.8 million  , excluding the decrease of   $2.9 million   of freight and reimbursements, in the third quarter of 2016 over the prior-year period, predominantly due to: 
             
    Lower sales volumes of 313 thousand long tons which resulted in lower revenues of   $24.0 million   due to: 
                
    A termination of a customer contract in the fourth quarter of the prior year that was reinstated in June of 2016, to begin in 2017, offset partially by fewer nominated tons on short term contracts with the customer in the interim; and 
                
    Space limitations at a third party and customer locations for different ore grades which limited that customer's ability to take iron ore pellets in the quarter.  
                
    These decreases were offset partially by additional sales in the third quarter of 2016 that resulted from a short-term contract with a customer that we made no sales to in 2015. 
                 
    Changes in customer pricing negatively affected the realized revenue rate by $2 per long ton driven primarily by the negative inflation projections of certain price indices and lower full-year world pricing than the 2015 period;  
                
    An unfavorable variance of $1 per long ton due to overall net lower contracted pricing terms for two customers which were based on stated negotiated rates compared to the prior-year period; and 
                
    A decrease in revenue rate of $1 per long ton due to lower projected hot-rolled coil pricing for one customer compared to the prior-year period. 
                
    Partially offset by an increase in service revenue from increased rail activity for approximately $1 per long ton. 
     Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the third quarter of 2016 decreased   $57.6 million  , excluding the decrease of   $2.9 million   of freight and reimbursements from the same period in the prior-year period, predominantly as a result of: 
             
    Lower idle costs of   $21.1 million   as a result of the Empire mine idle during the third quarter of 2015 and due to the United Taconite mine which started production again in August of 2016 versus the idle that began in August 2015.  Additionally, our Northshore mine was in full production during the third quarter of 2016 versus the one idled production line at Northshore during the third quarter of 2015;  
                
    Decreased sales volumes as discussed above that decreased costs by   $17.2 million   compared to the prior-year period; and 
                
    Lower costs in the third quarter of 2016 in comparison to the prior-year period primarily driven by the reduction in maintenance and repair spend due to cost reduction initiatives and condition based monitoring, year-over-year reduction in energy rates and lower employment costs.

The following is a summary of U.S. Iron Ore results for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :   

  Sales margin for U.S. Iron Ore was   $149.7 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $177.7 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decline compared to the prior-year period is attributable to a decrease in revenue of   $177.0 million   partially offset by lower cost of goods sold and operating expenses of   $149.0 million  .  Sales margin per long ton decreased   5.0 percent   to   $13.19   in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. 
    Revenue decreased by   $162.6 million  , excluding the freight and reimbursements decrease of   $14.4 million  , from the prior-year period, predominantly due to: 
             
    Lower sales volumes of   1.4 million   long tons, which resulted in lower revenues of   $117.5 million   due to: 
                
    A termination of a customer contract in the fourth quarter of the prior year that was reinstated in June 2016, to begin 2017, offset partially by fewer nominated tons on short term contracts with the customer in the interim; and  
                
    Lower demand from two customer locations primarily due to their inventory levels which resulted from idled blast furnaces at the customer's facilities. 
     
   47 

     Table of Contents  

These decreases were offset partially by additional sales in 2016 that resulted from a short-term contract with a customer that we made no sales to in 2015. 
                
    The average year-to-date realized product revenue rate declined by   $4.03   per long ton or   5.0 percent   to   $76.82   per long ton in nine months ended September 30, 2016, which resulted in a decrease of   $45.1 million  , compared to the prior-year period.  The decline is a result of: 
                
    Changes in customer pricing negatively affected the realized revenue rate by $4 per long ton driven primarily by the negative inflation of certain price indices, the reduction in Platts IODEX price and the impact of higher carryover pricing in the prior-year period than the 2016 period; and 
                
    An unfavorable variance of $1 per long ton due to overall net lower contracted pricing terms for two customers that were based on stated negotiated rates compared to the prior-year period. 
                
    These decreases were offset partially by an increase in realized revenue rates of a $1 per long ton as a result of one major customer contract with a pricing mechanism tied to the full-year estimate of their hot-rolled coil pricing.  The estimate in 2016 has increased since the beginning of the year, compared to 2015 when the estimate was revised lower. 
     Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the first nine months of   2016   decreased   $134.6 million  , excluding the freight and reimbursements decrease of   $14.4 million   from the same period in the prior year, predominantly as a result of: 
             
    Decreased sales volumes as discussed above that decreased costs by   $84.6 million   compared to the prior-year period; and 
                
    Lower costs in comparison to the prior-year period primarily driven by the reduction in maintenance and repair costs resulting from cost reduction initiatives and condition based monitoring, year-over-year reduction in energy rates, and lower employment costs. 
                
    Partially offset by increased costs of   $22.2 million   from the United Taconite mine idle that began in August 2015 and continued until the last week of August 2016 and the Northshore mine full idle that began in November 2015 through May 2016 versus the one idled production line during the first nine months of 2015. 
     Production 
    Cliffs' share of production in its U.S. Iron Ore segment decreased by   5.9 percent   during the third quarter of   2016   when compared to the same period in   2015  .  The decrease in production volumes primarily is attributable to idled mining operations, our election to take additional incremental production tons from Tilden in the third quarter of 2015 and timing of maintenance.  
  Cliffs' share of production in its U.S. Iron Ore segment decreased by   26.2 percent   in the first nine months of   2016   when compared to the same period in   2015  .  The decrease in production volumes primarily is attributable to the idled mining facilities.  Our United Taconite operation was idled until August 2016 versus operating at full production for most of the comparable period in 2015, until it was idled at the beginning of August 2015, causing a decrease in production volume of 2.7 million long tons. Secondly, our Northshore mining operations were fully idled, including all four furnaces until May 2016 compared to running a three furnace operation through September 30, 2015, causing a decrease in production of 1.7 million long tons.  These decreases were offset partially by higher production at Empire of 1.4 million long tons excluding tolled tons for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior-year period, due to the plant idle that started at the end of June 2015 and ended in October 2015, versus the indefinite idle that began in August 2016.

Asia Pacific Iron Ore 
  The following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore results for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Sales margin for Asia Pacific Iron Ore increased to   $18.9 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   $6.4 million   for the same period in   2015   and sales margin per metric ton increased   206.8 percent   to   $6.75   per metric ton in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The increase compared to the prior-year period primarily is attributable to a decrease in cost of goods sold and operating expenses of   $9.7 million   in addition to higher revenue of   $2.8 million  . 
  Revenue increased   $5.9 million   in the third quarter of   2016   over the prior-year period, excluding the decrease of   $3.1 million   of freight and reimbursements, primarily as a result of: 
             
    The average year-to-date realized product revenue rate increased by   $3.87   per metric ton or   9.9 percent   to   $42.87   per metric ton in third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior-year period, which resulted in an increase of   $11.2 million  , including the impact of foreign exchange.  This increase is a result of: 
                
    Changes in benchmark pricing positively affected the realized revenue rate by $4 per metric ton driven by the increase in Platts IODEX price; 
                
    A favorable variance of $3 per metric ton improvement due to a $8.5 million hedging impact in 2015 that was not repeated in 2016, due to the suspension of the hedging program that protected against volatility in exchange rates; and

Lower average Australia to Asia freight rates in the third quarter compared to the prior-year period, which is a component in the formula pricing, favorably affected the revenue rate by $1 per metric ton. 
                
    Partially offset by a decrease in revenue rate of $4 per metric ton due to price adjustments to meet market competition to compensate for varying quality ores and a reduction in iron content.   
                
    The sales volume decreased by 127 thousand metric tons, or 4.3 percent, to 2.8 million metric tons in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior-year period.  The decrease in tons sold resulted in decreased revenue of   $5.3 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and was due to one less shipment or 16 total shipments during the period compared to 17 total shipments during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Adverse weather conditions delayed the loading of the last scheduled shipment for the third quarter of 2016. 
                
    Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased $  6.6 million  , excluding the decrease of   $3.1 million   of freight and reimbursements, compared to the same period in   2015   primarily as a result of:  
                
    A reduction in production costs in the current period that were lower compared to the weighted average cost of inventory for a favorable change of $10.4 million;  
                
    Decreased costs of   $5.0 million   as a result of lower sales volumes as discussed above compared to the same period in the prior year; and 
                
    A reduction in transportation costs and administrative costs of $4.0 million from reduced rail freight rates, employment costs and contractor fees also reduced costs.  
                
    Partially offset by increased mining and maintenance costs of $4.8 million which were driven by increased mining activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and an environmental reserve adjustment of $3.1 million that benefited the prior-year period and was not repeated in 2016; and 
                
    Partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate variances of   $4.5 million  .

The following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore results for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Sales margin for Asia Pacific Iron Ore increased to   $58.1 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   $15.5 million   for the same period in   2015   and sales margin per metric ton increased   $4.89   per metric ton or   274.7 percent   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase compared to the prior-year period primarily is attributable to a decrease in cost of goods sold and operating expenses of   $47.9 million   partially offset by lower revenue of   $5.3 million  .  
  Revenue decreased   $0.3 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior-year period, excluding the freight and reimbursements decrease of   $5.0 million  , primarily as a result of: 
             
    The year-to-date realized revenue from product and services increased by   $4.0 million  , excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior-year period.  This increase is a result of:  
                
    A $3 per metric ton improvement due to a $28.8 million hedging impact in 2015 that was not repeated in 2016, due to the suspension of the hedging program that protected against volatility in exchange rates; and 
                
    Lower average Australia to Asia freight rates compared to the prior-year to date period, which is a component in the formula pricing, favorably affected the revenue rate by $2 per metric ton. 
     
   51 

     Table of Contents  

Partially offset by changes in benchmark pricing which negatively affected the realized revenue rate by $3 per metric ton driven by the reduction in Platts IODEX price; and 
                
    Lower lump premiums of a $1 per metric ton due to lower average spot pricing and required discounts on those premiums. 
                
    The increase in average year-to-date realized product revenue rate was offset partially by unfavorable foreign exchange rate variances of   $4.0 million  . 
     Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $42.9 million  , excluding the freight and reimbursements decrease of   $5.0 million  , compared to the same period in   2015   primarily as a result of:  
             
    A reduction in mining costs of $12.2 million from mining efficiencies and transportation costs of $13.6 million due to decreased hauling volumes and reduced freight costs as a result of a revised mine plan; 
                
    Reduced administration and employment costs of $17.2 million due to lower headcount and contractor fees; and 
                
    Favorable foreign exchange rate variances of   $8.6 million  . 
                
    Partially offset by the impact of depleting our finished goods stock piles which has a weighted average cost of inventory that is higher than current production costs, for increased expense of $7.6 million. 
     Production 
  Production at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore mining complex during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   remained fairly consistent when compared to the same periods in   2015   and varied only slightly due to inclement weather during 2016. 
   
  Liquidity, Cash Flows and Capital Resources  
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities.  Our capital allocation process is focused on improving the strength of our balance sheet and creating financial flexibility to manage through current demand for our products and volatility in commodity prices.  We are focused on the preservation of liquidity in our business through the maximization of cash generation of our operations as well as reducing operating costs, limiting capital investments to those required to meet the current business plan, including regulatory and permission-to-operate related projects and lowering SG A expenses.  During the quarter, we issued common shares in a public offering, which provided net proceeds of $287.6 million that we used to fully redeem our senior notes due 2018.  As demonstrated in prior periods, we will continue to seek more opportunities to reduce our debt, including, without limitation, through further repurchases or exchange of our debt securities, including in exchange for our common shares.  Despite the improving conditions we experienced during the first nine months of 2016, we believe these efforts, which have been ongoing and will continue for the foreseeable future, remain a priority. 
  Based on our outlook for the next twelve months, which is subject to continued changing demand from steel makers that utilize our products and volatility in iron ore and domestic steel prices, we expect to generate cash from operations sufficient to meet our anticipated capital expenditures and cash requirements to service our debt obligations for the next 12 months.  Furthermore, we maintain incremental liquidity through the cash on our balance sheet and the availability provided by our ABL Facility. 
  Despite improving conditions, if we see reduced demand from our customers and/or iron ore or steel prices deteriorate significantly, we would face pressure on our available liquidity.  If this was the case, we would need to consider the sale of assets, further expense reductions and the possibility of issuing the remaining capacity under our senior secured notes.  There is a possibility that these further actions would not be sufficient to maintain adequate levels of available liquidity particularly if industry conditions deteriorated severely. 
  Refer to  Outlook  for additional guidance regarding expected future results, including projections on pricing, sales volume and production. 
  The following discussion summarizes the significant activities impacting our cash flows during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   as well as known expected impacts to our future cash flows over the next 12 months.  Refer to the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows   for additional information.

Operating Activities    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $72.1 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net cash used by operating activities of   $59.5 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in operating cash flows in the first nine months of 2016 primarily was due to lower operating costs previously discussed and improved cash flows from working capital.  The most significant driver in the working capital changes was a result of effectively managing our inventory levels and matching those levels to meet our customers' demand.  This can be seen by a decrease in finished goods inventory during the first nine months of 2016 of $7.0 million compared to the $120.2 million build of finished goods inventory that occurred during the same period in 2015.  Additionally, we have responsibly managed our costs and remained focused on reducing our liabilities, as can be seen by the overall decrease in current liabilities to   $323.5 million   as of September 30, 2016 down from $669.9 million as of September 30, 2015. 
  Through the first nine months of 2016, the Platts IODEX has, despite its volatility, remained at encouraging levels.  We believe this is the result of improved sentiment about steel demand in China and signs of high-cost capacity closures.  Furthermore, major supply additions from both Brazil and Australia anticipated to come online this year have experienced difficulties ramping up and completion dates have been further delayed.  In addition, we believe the new management teams at the major Australian iron ore producers will show more supply discipline for the remainder of the year and through 2017, which could help maintain or even improve these current price levels.  
  While iron ore prices remained at encouraging levels during the third quarter, we did see a substantial decline in the price of hot-rolled coil in the United States.  While still remaining at a level considerably higher than its lows in January 2016, the price of hot-rolled coil dropped over $100 per short ton during the third quarter. We believe this is a result of attempts by China to circumvent antidumping and countervailing duties by using other countries as an intermediary, most notably Vietnam. This issue was addressed in late September with a circumvention case against Vietnam made by the domestic U.S. mills, who are seeking to impose duties on these imports as well.  We also believe the price weakness is attributable to normal seasonality of the business, as well as the uncertain political environment in the United States with respect to the November Presidential election.  As these uncertainties subside and trade case enforcement continues, we believe the hot-rolled coil pricing environment in the United States will improve. 
  We believe we have sufficient capital resources for the next 12 months to support our operations and other financial obligations through cash generated from operations, our financing arrangements augmented by our efficient tax structure that allows us to repatriate cash from our foreign operations, if necessary.  Our U.S. cash and cash equivalents balance at   September 30, 2016   was $78.7 million, or approximately 59.5 percent of our consolidated total cash and cash equivalents balance of   $132.2 million  .  
    Investing Activities    
    Net cash used by investing activities   was   $39.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $57.2 million   for the comparable period in   2015  .  We spent approximately $31.0 million and $58.0 million globally on expenditures related to sustaining capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Sustaining capital spend includes infrastructure, mobile equipment, environment, safety, fixed equipment, product quality and health. 
  We are maintaining our full-year 2016 capital expenditures expectation of $75 million, which includes approximately $30 million in capital spend required to produce a specialized, super-flux pellet called "Mustang" at United Taconite in order to meet a customer's pellet specification requirements. 
  In alignment with our strategy to focus on allocating capital among key priorities related to liquidity management, and business investment, we anticipate total cash used during the next twelve months of $60 million on capital expenditures related to constructing necessary infrastructure to produce the Mustang pellet.  During the first nine months of 2016, we incurred capital expenditures of $15 million for this project. 
    Financing Activities    
    Net cash used by financing activities in the first nine months of   2016   was   $186.0 million  , compared to   $98.2 million   provided by financing activities for the comparable period in   2015  .  Net cash used by financing activities included paying off the remaining balance of our equipment loans, which resulted in cash outflows of   $95.6 million  .  Additionally, we redeemed all of our outstanding senior notes due 2018 for   $301.0 million  , which was offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of common shares of   $287.6 million  .  We made further cash outflows related to financing activities attributable to distributions of partnership equity of   $52.5 million   and we anticipate approximately $29 million in partnership equity will be distributed within the next 12 months.  Net cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2015 included issuance of First Lien Notes, which resulted in net proceeds excluding debt issuance costs of   $503.5

million  , which was offset partially by the redemption of senior notes of   $225.9 million   and debt issuance costs of   $33.6 million  .  Cash used by financing activities in the first nine months of 2015 included payments on our equipment loans of   $36.9 million  . Additionally, in the first nine months of 2015 cash dividends of   $38.4 million   were paid on Preferred Shares and   $31.7 million   was attributable to distributions of partnership equity.  
   
  Capital Resources  
    We expect to fund our business obligations from available cash, operations and existing borrowing arrangements.  We also may pursue other funding strategies in the equity and/or debt markets to strengthen our liquidity.  The following represents a summary of key liquidity measures as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Our primary sources of funding are cash on hand, which totaled   $132.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , cash generated by our business and availability under the ABL Facility.  The combination of cash and availability under the ABL Facility gives us approximately $379.1 million in liquidity entering the fourth quarter of 2016, which is expected to be adequate to fund operations, letter of credit obligations, sustaining capital expenditures and other cash commitments for at least the next 12 months.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the ABL Facility liquidity requirements and, therefore, the springing financial covenant requiring a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 was not applicable. We believe that the cash on hand and the ABL Facility provide us sufficient liquidity to support our operating, investing and financing activities.  We have the capability to issue additional 1.5 Lien Notes and additional Second Lien Notes, both subject to compliance with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and other applicable covenants under our ABL Facility.  Available capacity of these secured notes could however be limited by market conditions.  If demand for our products and pricing deteriorates and persists for a continued period of time, we believe our ability to maintain the required Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 would be difficult, and we may have to seek a waiver from the lenders under our ABL Facility, which we may not be able to obtain.   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain arrangements that are not reflected on our   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position  .  These arrangements include minimum "take or pay" purchase commitments, such as minimum electric power demand charges, minimum coal, diesel and natural gas purchase commitments, minimum railroad transportation commitments and minimum port facility usage commitments; financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and bank guarantees; and operating leases, which relate primarily to equipment and office space. 
   
  Market Risks    
  We are subject to a variety of risks, including those caused by changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  We have established policies and procedures to manage such risks; however, certain risks are beyond our control. 
  Pricing Risks 
  Commodity Price Risk 
    Our consolidated revenues include the sale of iron ore pellets, iron ore lump and iron ore fines.  Our financial results can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of iron ore.  World market prices for these  
  
   54 

     Table of Contents  

commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control.      The world market price that most commonly is utilized in our iron ore sales contracts is the Platts IODEX pricing, which can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as global economic growth or contraction, change in demand for steel or changes in availability of supply.   
  Provisional Pricing Arrangements 
  Certain of our U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore customer supply agreements specify provisional price calculations, where the pricing mechanisms generally are based on market pricing, with the final revenue rate to be based on market inputs at a specified point in time in the future, per the terms of the supply agreements.  The difference between the provisionally agreed-upon price and the estimated final revenue rate is characterized as a freestanding derivative and is required to be accounted for separately once the revenue has been recognized.  The derivative instrument is adjusted to fair value through   Product revenues   each reporting period based upon current market data and forward-looking estimates provided by management until the final revenue rate is determined.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , we have recorded   $0.4 million   as derivative assets included in   Other current assets   and   $2.7 million   as derivative liabilities included in   Other current liabilities   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Position   related to our estimate of the final revenue rate with our U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers.  These amounts represent the difference between the provisional price agreed upon with our customers based on the supply agreement terms and our estimate of the final sales rate based on the price calculations established in the supply agreements.  As a result, we recognized a net   $4.5 million   and   $22.9 million   decrease in   Product revenues   in the   Statements of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Operations   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to these arrangements. 
  Customer Supply Agreements 
  A certain supply agreement with one U.S. Iron Ore customer provides for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer s average annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnace.  The supplemental pricing is characterized as a freestanding derivative, which is finalized based on a future price, and is adjusted to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled.  The fair value of the instrument is determined using an income approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot-rolled coil at the steelmaker s facilities. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a derivative asset of   $28.0 million  , representing the fair value of the pricing factors, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot-rolled coil price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customer s blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility, subject to final pricing at a future date.  This compares with a derivative asset of   $5.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . We estimate that a $75 positive change in the average hot-rolled coil price realized from the   September 30, 2016   estimated price recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase by approximately $36.4 million and a $75 negative change in the average hot-rolled coil price realized from the   September 30, 2016   estimated price recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to decrease by approximately $30.7 million, thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount. 
  We have not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate the risk of adverse price fluctuations; however certain of our term supply agreements contain price collars, which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our products during any given year. 
    Volatile Energy and Fuel Costs 
  The volatile cost of energy is an important issue affecting our production costs at our iron ore operations.  Our consolidated U.S. Iron Ore mining ventures consumed approximately 13.3 million MMBtu s of natural gas at an average delivered price of $2.85 per MMBtu inclusive of the natural gas hedge impact or $2.87 per MMBtu net of the natural gas hedge impact during the first nine months of   2016  .  Additionally, our consolidated U.S. Iron Ore mining ventures consumed approximately 13.2 million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of $1.57 per gallon inclusive of the diesel fuel hedge impact or $1.52 per gallon net of the diesel fuel hedge impact during the first nine months of   2016  .  The hedging of natural gas and diesel is further discussed later in this section.  Consumption of diesel fuel by our Asia Pacific operations was approximately 7.1 million gallons at an average delivered price of $1.53 per gallon for the same period. 
  In the ordinary course of business, there may also be increases in prices relative to electrical costs at our U.S. mine sites.  Specifically, our Tilden mine in Michigan has entered into large curtailable special contracts with Wisconsin Electric Power Company.  Charges under those special contracts are subject to a power supply cost recovery mechanism that is based on variations in the utility's actual fuel and purchase power expenses.

Our strategy to address increasing natural gas and diesel rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage, identifying alternative providers and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuels.  An energy hedging program was implemented in order to manage the price risk of diesel and natural gas at our U.S. Iron Ore mines during the first quarter of 2016. We will continue to monitor relevant energy markets for risk mitigation opportunities and may make additional forward purchases or employ other hedging instruments in the future as warranted and deemed appropriate by management.  Assuming we do not enter into further hedging activity in the near term, a 10 percent change in natural gas and diesel fuel prices would result in a change of approximately $2.0 million in our annual fuel and energy cost based on expected consumption for 2016.  Based on our electrical contracts with our suppliers we are not susceptible to risks associated with fluctuations in electricity rates. 
  Valuation of Other Long-Lived Assets  
  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in market pricing; a significant adverse change in legal or environmental factors or in the business climate; changes in estimates of our recoverable reserves; unanticipated competition; and slower growth or production rates.  Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of our long-lived assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and statement of financial position. 
  A comparison of each asset group's carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including cost of disposition, is used to determine if an asset is recoverable.  Projected future cash flows reflect management's best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period, including growth rates in revenues and costs, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and capital expenditures.  If the carrying value of the asset group is higher than its undiscounted future cash flows, the asset group is measured at fair value and the difference is recorded as a reduction to the long-lived assets.  We estimate fair value using a market approach, an income approach or a cost approach. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our operations in Australia, which could impact our financial condition.  With respect to Australia, foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, but the functional currency of our Asia Pacific operations is the Australian dollar.  Our Asia Pacific operations receive funds in U.S. currency for their iron ore sales and incur costs in Australian currency. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had no outstanding Australian foreign exchange rate contracts for which we elected hedge accounting.  Our last outstanding Australian foreign exchange rate contract held as a cash flow hedge matured in October 2015.  We have suspended entering into new foreign exchange rate contracts for the remainder of 2016.  We have waived compliance with our current derivative financial instruments and hedging activities policy through December 31, 2016.  In the future, we may enter into additional hedging instruments as needed in order to further hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest payable on our senior notes is at fixed rates.  Interest payable under our ABL Facility is at a variable rate based upon the base rate plus the base rate margin depending on the excess availability.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   amounts drawn on the ABL Facility.  
    Supply Concentration Risks 
  Many of our mines are dependent on one source each of electric power and natural gas.  A significant interruption or change in service or rates from our energy suppliers could impact materially our production costs, margins and profitability. 
   
  Outlook 
  We provide full-year expected revenues-per-ton ranges based on different assumptions of seaborne iron ore prices.  We indicated that each different pricing assumption holds all other assumptions constant, including customer mix, as well as industrial commodity prices, freight rates, energy prices, production input costs and/or hot-rolled coil prices (all factors contained in certain of our supply agreements).  
  
   56 

     Table of Contents  

The U.S. Iron Ore table further assumes full-year hot-rolled coil pricing of approximately $470 per short ton. We note that this estimate is based on our customers  realized prices and not an index or spot market price, valid through the end of 2016.  This represents a $10 decrease from the previous full-year price estimate of $480 per short ton.  For every $50 per short ton change in the customers  full-year hot-rolled coil prices, our U.S. Iron Ore revenue realizations per long ton in 2016 would be expected to increase or decrease $2.00 if steel prices increase or decrease, respectively. 
  The table below provides certain Platts IODEX averages for the remaining three months of 2016 and the corresponding full-year realization for the U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore segments.  The estimates consider actual Platts IODEX rates and our actual revenue realizations for the first nine months of 2016.  

U.S. Iron Ore Outlook   (Long Tons) 
  We are maintaining our full-year sales volume expectation of 18 million long tons.  Our 2016 production volume guidance of 16.5 million long tons is also maintained. 
  We are maintaining our cash production cost per long ton   2    expectation of $50 - $55 and the cash cost of goods sold per long ton   2    expectation of $55 - $60.  
  We anticipate depreciation, depletion and amortization to be approximately $5 per long ton for full-year 2016. 
  Asia Pacific Iron Ore Outlook   (Metric Tons, F.O.B. the port) 
  We are maintaining our full-year 2016 Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales and production volume forecast of approximately 11.5 million metric tons.  The product mix is expected to contain 50 percent lump and 50 percent fines.  
  Based on a full-year average exchange rate of $0.75 U.S. Dollar to Australian Dollar, we are maintaining our full-year 2016 Asia Pacific Iron Ore cash production cost per metric ton   2    expectation of $25 - $30.  The cash cost of goods sold per metric ton   2    is also unchanged at $30 - $35.  We indicated that for every $0.01 change in this exchange rate for the remainder of the year, our full-year cash cost of goods sold is impacted by approximately $2 million. 
  We anticipate depreciation, depletion and amortization to be approximately $2 per metric ton for full-year 2016.

Cash cost per long/metric ton is defined as cost of goods sold and operating expenses per ton less depreciation, depletion and amortization per long/metric ton. 

SG A Expenses and Other Expectations 
  Our full-year 2016 SG A expenses expectation is $104 million, a $4 million increase from the previous expectation, primarily driven by the un-forecasted $4 million USW labor contract signing bonus. 
  We are decreasing our full-year 2016 interest expense expectation to be approximately $200 million. Of the $200 million expectation, approximately $170 million is considered cash and $30 million is considered non-cash.  
  Consolidated full-year 2016 depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to be approximately $120 million. 
  Capital Budget Update 
  We are maintaining our full-year 2016 capital expenditures expectation of $75 million.

Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Executive s right to receive Severance Compensation and other benefits hereunder will not be assignable, transferable or delegable, whether by pledge, creation of a security interest, or otherwise, other than by a transfer by the Executive s will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, in the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section 12(c), the Company shall have no liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned, transferred or delegated. 
              (d) 
    The obligation of the Company to provide Severance Compensation and other benefits hereunder shall represent an unsecured obligation of the Company. 
              (e) 
    The Company recognizes that each Executive will have no adequate remedy at law for breach by the Company of any of the agreements contained herein and, in the event of any such breach, the Company hereby agrees and consents that each Executive shall  
     
   11 

be entitled to a decree of specific performance, mandamus or other appropriate remedy to enforce performance of obligations of the Company under this Agreement.  
           (f) 
    This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof and replaces the Prior Agreement, which Prior Agreement shall, without further action, be superseded and replaced without further effect as of the Effective Date.   
              12. 
    Governing Law  .  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Ohio, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws of such State. 
              13. 
    Effect on Prior Agreements  .  This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall expressly replace, supersede, and render null, void and invalid any prior severance pay agreement or agreements of a similar nature previously entered into by the Company and Employee with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Prior Agreement; provided  however, for the avoidance of doubt, the restriction covenant provisions in this Agreement shall not supersede any similar restrictive covenant provisions in any other agreement entered into by and between the Company and Employee that would be in effect upon a termination of employment for any reason other than a Qualifying Termination following a Change in Control. 
              14. 
    Validity  .  If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to any other person or circumstances will not be affected, and the provision so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal will be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable, valid or legal. 
              15. 
    Administration of This Agreement.       
     (a)      In General  .  This Agreement shall be administered by the Company. 
           (b) 
    Delegation of Duties  .  The Company may delegate any of its administrative duties, including, without limitation, duties with respect to the processing, review, investigation, approval and payment of Severance Compensation under this Agreement, and any severance pay generally, to named administrator or administrators. 
              (c) 
    Regulations  .  The Company shall promulgate any rules and regulations it deems necessary in order to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to interpret the terms and conditions of this Agreement;   provided  ,   however  , that no rule, regulation or interpretation shall be contrary to the provisions of this Agreement. 
              16. 
    Amendment and Termination  .  The Company reserves the right, except as hereinafter provided, at any time and from time to time, to amend, modify, change or terminate this Agreement and/or any action by the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Company s Board of Directors relating thereto, including any Annex or Exhibit thereto;   provided  ,   however  , that any such amendment, modification, change or termination that adversely affects the rights of the Executive under this Agreement may not be made without the written consent of the Executive except as provided in the next sentence; and provided further that any such amendment or termination shall be made only if permitted in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Executive acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement and the payments and benefits provided for hereunder are subject to the terms and conditions of the Company's clawback policy (if any) as may be effect from time to time specifically to implement Section 10D of the Exchange Act and  
     
   12 

any applicable rules or regulations promulgated thereunder (including applicable rules and regulations of any national securities exchange on which the Company's common shares may be traded) (the "Compensation Recovery Policy"), and that applicable sections of this Agreement shall be deemed superseded by and subject to the terms and conditions of the Compensation Recovery Policy from and after the effective date thereof. 
           17. 
    Construction  .  The masculine gender, when used in this Agreement, shall be deemed to include the feminine gender and the singular number shall include the plural, unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary. 
              18. 
    Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement. 
               (a) 
    General  .  The amounts payable under this Agreement are intended to be exempt or excluded from the application of Code Section 409A, or are otherwise intended to avoid the incurrence of tax penalties under Code Section 409A and, with respect to amounts payable under this Agreement that are subject to Code Section 409A, this Agreement shall in all respects be administered in accordance with Code Section 409A.  Each payment under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A.  In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement.  Prior to the Change in Control but within the time period permitted by the applicable Treasury Regulations (or such later time as may be permitted under Code Section 409A or any IRS or Department of Treasury rules or other guidance issued thereunder), the Company may, in consultation with the Executive, modify the Agreement, in the least restrictive manner necessary and without any diminution in the value of the payments to the Executive, in order to avoid the incurrence of tax penalties under Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under this Agreement is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Company, its affiliates nor their respective boards of directors shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties, or other similar monetary amounts owed by Executive or other taxpayers as a result of the Agreement. 
              (b) 
    Separation from Service; Specified Employee  .  For clarity, the amounts payable under this Agreement shall only be paid following the Executive s Separation from Service.  If a termination of the Executive s employment does not constitute a Separation from Service, any amounts payable under this Agreement shall be delayed until after the date Executive incurs a Separation from Service.  For clarity, the foregoing provision shall not cause any forfeiture of the payments due to the Executive under this Agreement, but shall only act as a delay until such time as Executive incurs a Separation from Service.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Code Section 409A (as determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Company as in effect on the Separation from Service) (a    Specified Employee   ), amounts and benefits that constitute  nonqualified deferred compensation  within the meaning of Code Section 409A that would otherwise be payable and or provided under this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the Separation from Service shall instead be paid, with interest determined as of the Separation from Service, or provided, on the first normal payroll date after the date that is six months following the Executive s Separation from Service (the    Delayed Payment Date   ).  If the Executive dies following the Separation from Service and prior to the payment of any amounts delayed to the Delayed Payment  
     
   13 

Date on account of Code Section 409A, such amounts shall be paid to the personal representative of the Executive s estate within 30 days after the date of the Executive s death. 
           (c) 
    Reimbursements and In-Kind Benefits  .  All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement that constitute  nonqualified deferred compensation  within the meaning of Code Section 409A shall be made or provided in accordance with Code Section 409A, including, without limitation, that (i) in no event shall reimbursements by the Company under this Agreement be made later than the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the applicable fees and expenses were incurred,   provided  , that the Executive shall have submitted an invoice for such fees and expenses at least 10 days before the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which such fees and expenses were incurred; (ii) the amount of in-kind benefits that the Company is obligated to pay or provide in any given calendar year (other than medical reimbursements described in Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv)(B)) shall not affect the in-kind benefits that the Company is obligated to pay or provide in any other calendar year; (iii) the Executive s right to have the Company pay or provide such reimbursements and in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit; and (iv) in no event shall the Company s obligations to make such reimbursements or to provide such in-kind benefits apply later than the Executive s remaining lifetime (or if longer, through the 20th anniversary of the Effective Date).  Prior to the Change in Control but within the time period permitted by the applicable Treasury Regulations (or such later time as may be permitted under Code Section 409A or any IRS or Department of Treasury rules or other guidance issued thereunder), the Company may, in consultation with the Executive, modify the Agreement, in the least restrictive manner necessary and without any diminution in the value of the payments to the Executive, in order to avoid the incurrence of tax penalties under Code Section 409A.

Exhibit 95  
  Mine Safety Disclosures 
  The operation of our mines located in the United States is subject to regulation by MSHA under the FMSH Act.  MSHA inspects these mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the FMSH Act.  We present information below regarding certain mining safety and health citations that MSHA has issued with respect to our mining operations.  In evaluating this information, consideration should be given to factors such as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of the mine; (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed and, in that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. 
  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, each operator of a coal or other mine is required to include certain mine safety results within its periodic reports filed with the SEC.  As required by the reporting requirements included in  1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we present the following items regarding certain mining safety and health matters, for the period presented, for each of our mine locations that are covered under the scope of the Dodd-Frank Act: 
           (A) 
    The total number of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard under section 104 of the FMSH Act (30 U.S.C. 814) for which the operator received a citation from MSHA; 
               (C) 
    The total number of citations and orders for unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health or safety standards under section 104(d) of the FMSH Act (30 U.S.C. 814(d)); 
              (D) 
    The total number of imminent danger orders issued under section 107(a) of the FMSH Act (30 U.S.C. 817(a)); 
              (E) 
    The total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA under the FMSH Act (30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.);  
              (F) 
    Legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission involving such coal or other mine as of the last day of the period; 
              (G) 
    Legal actions initiated before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission involving such coal or other mine during the period; and 
              (H) 
    Legal actions resolved before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission involving such coal or other mine during the period. 
     During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our U.S. mine locations did not receive any flagrant violations under section 110(b)(2) of the FMSH Act or any written notices of a pattern of violations, or the potential to have such a pattern of violations, under section 104(e) of the FMSH Act.  In addition, there were no mining-related fatalities at any of our U.S. mine locations during this same period. 

Following is a summary of the information listed above for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Amounts included under the heading  Total Dollar Value of MSHA Proposed Assessments  are the total dollar amounts for proposed assessments received from MSHA for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
              (2) 
    This number consists of 9 pending legal actions related to contests of citations and orders referenced in Subpart B of FMSH Act's procedural rules, 9 pending legal actions related to contests of proposed penalties referenced in Subpart C of FMSH Act's procedural rules, 1 appeal of judges' decisions or orders to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission referenced in Subpart H of FMSH Act's procedural rules, and 1 pending legal action related to complaints of discharge, discrimination, or interference referenced in Subpart E of FMSH Act's procedural rules. 
              (3) 
    This number consists of 10 pending legal actions related to contests of proposed penalties referenced in Subpart C of FMSH Act's procedural rules and 1 pending legal action related to complaints of discharge, discrimination, or interference referenced in Subpart E of FMSH Act's procedural rules. 
              (4) 
    This number consists of 4 pending legal actions related to contests of proposed penalties referenced in Subpart C of FMSH Act's procedural rules.  
              (5) 
    This number consists of 8 pending legal actions related to contests of proposed penalties referenced in Subpart C of FMSH Act's procedural rules and 2 pending legal actions related to contests of citations and orders referenced in Subpart B of FMSH Act's procedural rules.
