  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)  

  For the Three
and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS    

RC-1, Inc. (the  Company ),
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 14, 2009. The Company is currently considered to be in the development stage, and
has generated only limited revenues from its activities in the racing business. R-Course Promotions, LLC was formed in the State
of California on October 30, 2007. On June 1, 2009, in a merger classified as a transaction between parties under common control,
the sole membership interest owner in R-Course Promotions, LLC exchanged 125,000 membership interests for 1,786 common shares in
RC-1, Inc. Subsequent to the consummation of the merger, R-Course Promotions, LLC ceased to exist. The results of operations of
RC-1, Inc. and R-Course Promotions, LLC have been combined from October 30, 2007 forward through the date of merger. 

The Company is
a motorsports marketing business focused primary in road racing events in North America utilizing NASCAR type competition equipment. 

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   

Basis of presentation   

 The Company s financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). 

Interim Financial Statements   

 The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions
to form 10Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by
generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In our opinion the financial statements include all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. Operating
results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the final results that may be expected for
the year ended December 31, 2016. For more complete financial information, these unaudited financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC. 

Use of Estimates   

 The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Net income (loss) per share   

 The Company utilizes FASB ASC 260,  Earnings
per Share.  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings
per share except that the denominator is increased to include additional common share equivalents available upon exercise of stock
options and warrants using the treasury stock method. Dilutive common share equivalents include the dilutive effect of in-the-money
share equivalents, which are calculated based on the average share price for each period using the treasury stock method, excluding
any common share equivalents if their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and year ended
December 31, 2015 there were no potentially dilutive shares. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

 Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if adopted, will have a material effect on our financial statements. 

NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN   

These financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company's ability to continue
as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations, and the Company s ability
to raise additional capital as required. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result
from this uncertainty. 

NOTE 4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

Consulting expense to related parties   

On January 1, 2015, the Company extended
for three years a previous consulting agreement with a company owned and operated by the CEO and majority shareholder to provide
consulting services in the motor sports marketing industry. The consulting agreement requires a $5,000 monthly fee and can be terminated
by either party pursuant to a 60 day notice. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had an accrued payable
balance due to this related party of $165,000 and $120,000, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, the Company incurred related party consulting expense of $15,000 and $45,000 respectively. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred related party consulting expense of $ $45,000 respectively. 

On January 1, 2014, the Company entered
into an event services agreement with an event services company that is owned and controlled by an individual who is also
the owner and controller of a separate company that became an owner of 16.6% of the Company's issued and outstanding common shares
on June 15, 2014.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred and paid $0 and $47,500,
respectively, in consulting fees to this event services company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company incurred $0 and $108,000, respectively, in consulting fees to this event services company. 

Due to related parties   

On October 1, 2009, the Company entered
into a line of credit agreement for up to $600,000 with a related party owned and operated by the CEO and majority shareholder
that also provides motor sports marketing industry consulting services to the Company as needed. Under the agreement, the Company
receives operating fund advances and reimbursement for expenses incurred on behalf of the Company. The loan bears interest at eight
percent (8%) per annum. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company owed $178,164 and $155,364, respectively,
in operating advances to this related party. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued interest

this related party. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued interest on this line of credit in

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PLAN OF OPERATION  

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT NOTICE  

This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For this purpose any statements contained
in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting
the foregoing, words such as  may,   will,   expect,   believe,   anticipate, 
 estimate  or  continue  or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially depending
on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. These factors include but are not limited to economic conditions
generally and in the industries in which we may participate; competition within our chosen industry, including competition from
much larger competitors; technological advances and failure to successfully develop business relationships. 

BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY  

Background  

We are a development stage small motorsports
production company which was originally organized in 2007 to participate in  Road Racing  motorsports events organized
by several motorsports sanctioning bodies such as The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing ( NASCAR ), and
The International Motorsports Association ( IMSA ). The Road Racing motorsports events require the use of  Stock
Cars  that are professionally modified for Road Racing, and  Sports Cars  that are specifically manufactured
for competition Road Racing. The Company's principal executive offices are located at 110 Sunrise Center Drive, Thomasville, NC
27360 and its telephone number is (760) 230-1617 

We are focused on ways to attract new sponsors,
agency clients and collect money purses for finishing positions. The Company engages in regional and national motorsports events
involving road course racing. The Company has the potential to earn revenues in multiple ways. The Company owns three race cars
which it uses for promotional and marketing operations as well as from time to time enters into races for a chance at winning purse
money. Only if the Company race car finishes in a top position, will it earn purse money. The Company s target revenue stream
is to actively market its advertising services in the mobile billboard industry. The Company also plans to negotiate sponsorship
deals with other race teams whereby the Company acts as an agent to sell advertising sponsorship packages. 

In 2012, we commenced offering racing production
and management services to potential clients that wish to participate in motorsports racing. Our production services range from
producing a full  turnkey  motorsports racing team, to sourcing or providing management of, or access to, any part of
equipment or human services required to participate in one or more racing events. The following is a list of some of what
services we offer to potential clients: 

Acting as consultant and liaison between the client and the sanctioning body so that the client is able to participate in motorsport events.   

Sourcing of:    
 
      fully prepared and ready for racing racecars    
 
      racing driver(s)   
 
      crew chiefs    
 
      car chiefs   
 
      Mechanic crews    
 
       Over the wall  pit crews    

Producing pre- and post-race social events   

Among our potential clients are racing
drivers who wish to participate in sanctioned racing events; businesses that wish to market their brand through participation in
sanctioned racing events; businesses which wish to stage hosting and promotional parties and events before, during and after sanctioned
race events, and race teams that are unfamiliar with particular racing series event and require our assistance to participate in
such racing series. 

In 2015, we participated in the following
NASCAR sanctioned events:  

In 2016, when we enter a racing event for
marketing purposes, we intend to use our own vehicles, and equipment, or lease a vehicle for the event. Also, when we use our own
vehicles in an event, we expect to offer advertising space on our vehicles to clients desiring to use our cars and equipment to
display and market their product or services by having the client's logo prominently appear on the vehicle. Our ability to attract
clients for our production services or advertising services will, in part, be dependent upon the success of our drivers and racecars
in the races we may decide to enter. We believe that if we win, or finish within the top 20 finishing places in a race, our ability
to attract clients for our production services and advertisers will be enhanced. There can be no assurance that we will be able
to secure clients for our production services nor advertisers for our vehicles. 

PLAN OF OPERATIONS  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenues  

The Company had no revenue during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

Operating Expenses  

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 operating expenses were $65,435 compared to $86,250 for the same period in 2015 for a decrease of $20,815. The decrease was
primarily a result of the decrease in Consulting to Related Parties to $15,000 from $62,500. 

Interest and Financing Costs  

Interest expense to unrelated parties
was $1,875 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,090 in the three months ended September 30,
2015. Interest expense accrued to related parties for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $9,013 as compared to
$5,164 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Income (Loss)  

The Company incurred losses of
$76,323 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $93,504 during the three months ended September 30, 2015
due to the factors discussed above. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenues  

The Company had no revenue during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,000 for the same period ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating Expenses  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 operating expenses were $143,475 compared to $225,874 for the same period in 2015 for a decrease of $82,399. The decrease
was primarily a result of the decrease in Consulting to Related Parties to $45,000 from $153,000 and a decrease in Race Expenses
to $15,003 compared to $27,118 for the same period in 2015. 

Interest and Financing Costs  

Interest expense to unrelated parties
was $5,625 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5,840 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest
expense accrued to related parties for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $25,718 as compared to $15,495 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Income (Loss)  

The Company incurred losses of $174,818
in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $246,207 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the factors
discussed above. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

The Company's
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability
and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

The Company has
a minimum cash balance available for payment of ongoing operating expenses and has incurred losses since inception and anticipates
future losses in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. Its continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional
debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available
on terms acceptable to the Company. 

The Company had $45,458 in cash at September
30, 2016 with availability on our related party line of credit with General Pacific Partners, LLC of $421,536. We
had a working capital deficit of $815,676. 

Operating activities  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we used $44,460 in operating activities compared to $163,389 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease
of $118,929. The decrease between the two periods was largely due to a reduction in operating costs paid and an increase in accounts
payable in 2016. 

Investing activities  

We neither generated nor used cash flow
in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the same for the period in 2015. 

Financing activities  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we generated $40,800 from financing activities compared to $177,312 for the same period ended September 30, 2015, a
decrease of $136,512. The change was due primarily to the reduction in operating costs paid in 2016 and increases in accounts
payable and accrued expenses. This resulted in decreased need to borrow on available lines of credit. 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk.  

As a  smaller reporting company, 
we are not required to provide the information under this Item 3. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   

Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our Chief Executive Officer as of the end of the period covered by this
report, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have not been effective as a result of
a weakness in the design of internal control over financial reporting identified below. 

As used herein,   disclosure controls
and procedures   mean controls and other procedures of our company that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The
Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management
and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 

This quarterly report does not include
an attestation report of our registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered independent public accounting firm. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  

No changes in our internal control over
financial reporting occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or material pending litigation. There
