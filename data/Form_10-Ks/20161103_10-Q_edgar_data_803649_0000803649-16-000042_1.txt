  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1.  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of EQC have been prepared without audit.  Certain information and footnote disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted.  We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  However, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report) for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Capitalized terms used, but not defined in this Quarterly Report, have the same meanings as in our Annual Report. 
    
  In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included.  All intercompany transactions and balances with or among our subsidiaries have been eliminated.  Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.  Reclassifications have been made to the prior years  financial statements to conform to the current year s presentation. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant estimates in the condensed consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts, purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and impairment of real estate and intangible assets. 
    
  Share amounts are presented in whole numbers, except where noted. 

Note 2.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of this ASU will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires more timely recognition of credit losses associated with financial assets.  This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of this ASU will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, but early adoption is permitted.  We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets. The ASU also requires lessees or lessors to capitalize only initial direct costs of leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, but early adoption is permitted.  We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.   
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. This update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  We

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 

are currently in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of this ASU will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This standard amends existing guidance to require the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as a deferred charge. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016 and made the following reclassifications to the prior years' consolidated balance sheet to conform to the current year's presentation (in thousands):  

In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, or ASU 2014-08.  ASU 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting a discontinued operation.  Under the new pronouncement, a disposal of a part of an organization that has a major effect on its operations and financial results is a discontinued operation.  We adopted ASU 2014-08 on January 1, 2015, and determined that our 2016 dispositions, 2015 dispositions and properties held for sale as of   September 30, 2016   do not individually represent a strategic shift, as defined by the standard, that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, the 2016 and 2015 dispositions and properties held for sale have not been presented as discontinued operations in the statements of operations. 

Note 3.  Real Estate Properties 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we made improvements, excluding tenant-funded improvements, to our properties totaling   $88.5 million   and $  46.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  Properties Held For Sale: 
    
  We classify all properties that meet the criteria outlined in the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the   FASB Accounting Standards Codification   (Codification) as held for sale on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  As of December 31, 2015, we had   no   properties classified as held for sale.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we classified the following property as held for sale (dollars in thousands):    

Summarized balance sheet information for the property classified as held for sale is as follows (in thousands):

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of   91   properties (  135   buildings) and   one   land parcel with a combined   18.9 million   square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of   $2.0 billion  , excluding closing costs.   

Note 4.  Real Estate Mortgages Receivable 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had total real estate mortgages receivable with an aggregate carrying value of   $8.1 million   included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  We provided mortgage financing totaling   $7.7 million   at   6.0%   per annum in connection with our sale of   three   suburban office and industrial properties (  18   buildings) in January 2013 in Dearborn, MI; this real estate mortgage requires monthly interest payments and matures on   January 24, 2023  .  We also provided mortgage financing totaling   $0.4 million   at   6.0%   per annum in connection with our sale of a suburban office property in Salina, NY in April 2012. This real estate mortgage requires monthly interest payments and matures on   April 30, 2019  .   
    
  We monitor the payment history of the borrowers and have determined that   no   allowance for losses related to these real estate mortgages receivable was necessary at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .   

Note 5.  Indebtedness 
    
  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan: 
  We are party to a credit agreement pursuant to which the lenders agreed to provide a   $750.0 million   unsecured revolving credit facility, a   $200.0 million     5  -year term loan facility, and a   $200.0 million     7  -year term loan facility. The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 28, 2019, which maturity date may be extended for up to   two   additional periods of   six months   at our option subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee of   0.075%   of the aggregate amount available under the revolving credit facility. The   5  -year term loan and the   7  -year term loan have scheduled maturity dates of January 28, 2020 and January 28, 2022, respectively.  
    
  The credit agreement permits us to utilize up to   $100.0 million   of the revolving credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit.  Amounts outstanding under the credit agreement generally may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain exceptions.  We have the right to request increases in the aggregate maximum amount of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility and term loans up to an additional   $1.15 billion  , subject to certain conditions. 
       
  Borrowings under the   5  -year term loan and   7  -year term loan will, subject to certain exceptions, bear interest at a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 90 to 180 basis points for the   5  -year term loan and 140 to 235 basis points for the   7  -year term loan, in each case depending on our credit rating. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will, subject to certain exceptions, bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either a LIBOR rate or a base rate plus a margin of 87.5 to 155 basis points for LIBOR rate advances and 0 to 55 basis points for base rate advances, in each case depending on our credit rating. In addition, we are required to pay a facility fee of 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our credit rating, on the borrowings available under the revolving credit facility, whether or not utilized. 
    
  Borrowings under our revolving credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, which was 125 basis points as of   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was   1.78%  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   balance outstanding and   $750.0 million   available under our revolving credit facility and the facility fee as of   September 30, 2016   was   0.25%  . Our term loans currently bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread, which was 140 and 180 basis points for the   5  -year and   7  -year term loan, respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rates for the amounts outstanding under our   5  -year term loan and   7  -year term loan were   1.93%   and   2.33%  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $200.0 million   outstanding under each of our   5  -year and   7  -year term loans. 
    
  Debt Covenants: 
    
  Our public debt indenture and related supplements and our credit agreement contain a number of financial and other covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain financial ratios and a minimum net worth.  At   September 30, 2016  , we believe we

were in compliance with all of our respective covenants under our public debt indenture and related supplements and our credit agreement. 
    
  Senior Unsecured Notes: 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had senior unsecured notes of   $925.0 million   (excluding net discounts and unamortized deferred financing fees) maturing from 2017 through 2042. 
    
  On February 16, 2016, we redeemed at par   $139.1 million   of our   6.25%   senior unsecured notes due 2016 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.1 million   from the write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing fees for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Mortgage Notes Payable: 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   five   of our properties (  8   buildings) with an aggregate net book value of   $293.3 million   had secured mortgage notes totaling   $244.0 million   (including net premiums and unamortized deferred financing fees) maturing from 2017 through 2026. 

Note 6.  Shareholders  Equity 
    
  Common Share Issuances: 
    
  See Note 10 for information regarding equity issuances related to share-based compensation. 
    
  Common Share Repurchases: 
    
  On August 24, 2015, our Board of Trustees approved a common share repurchase plan, which authorizes the repurchase of up to   $100.0 million   of our outstanding common shares over the twelve month period following the date of authorization. On September 14, 2015, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of up to an additional   $100.0 million   of our outstanding common shares over the twelve month period following the date of authorization.  On March 17, 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of up to an additional   $150.0 million   of our outstanding common shares over the twelve month period following the date of authorization.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased and retired   983,789   of our common shares at a weighted average price of   $25.94   per share, for a total of   $25.5 million  . Since the inception of the common share repurchase plan through   September 30, 2016  , we have purchased and retired a total of   4,394,089   of our common shares at a weighted average price of   $25.80   per share, for a total of   $113.4 million  .  In August and September 2016, the first   two   share repurchase authorizations, of which   $86.6 million   was not utilized, expired.  The   $150.0 million   of remaining authorization available under our share repurchase program as of September 30, 2016 is scheduled to expire in March 2017. 
    
  Preferred Share Redemption: 
    
  On May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our   11,000,000   outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of   $25.00   per share, for a total of   $275.0 million  , plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.  The redemption payment occurred on May 16, 2016 (the first business day following the redemption date).  We recorded   $9.6 million   related to the excess fair value of consideration paid over the carrying value of the preferred shares as a reduction to net income attributable to common shareholders for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

  We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including the effect of changes in interest rates.  The only risk we currently manage by using derivative instruments is related to our interest rate risk.   
    
  We may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions. We do not intend to utilize derivatives for speculative or other purposes other than interest rate risk management. The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements. To mitigate this risk, we only enter into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with high credit ratings or with major financial institutions with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships. We do not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, we periodically use interest rate swaps, caps, or other similar instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  
    
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in cumulative other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During 2016, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate debt.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.   
    
  Amounts reported in cumulative other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable-rate debt.  During the next twelve months, we estimate that an additional   $0.7 million   will be reclassified from cumulative other comprehensive loss as an increase to interest expense. 
    
  We have interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure on   $168.1 million   of mortgage debt due 2019, which require interest at a spread over   LIBOR  .  The interest rate swap agreements utilized by us qualify as cash flow hedges and effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk by converting our floating interest rate debt to a fixed interest rate basis for this loan through December 1, 2016, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
    
  Our agreements with each of our derivative counterparties contain a provision providing that if we default or are capable of being declared in default on any of our indebtedness, we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position including accrued interest but excluding any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements was   $1.1 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not posted any collateral related to these agreements and were not in breach of any agreement provisions. If we had breached any of these provisions, we could have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their aggregate termination value of   $1.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  .

  2016 Equity Award Activity 
    
  On June 16, 2016, in accordance with the Company s compensation plan for independent Trustees, the Committee awarded each of the   nine   independent Trustees   $0.1 million   in restricted shares as part of their compensation for the 2016-2017 year of service on the Board of Trustees.  These awards equated to   3,463   shares per Trustee, for a total of   31,167   shares, valued at   $28.88   per share, the closing price of our common shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on that day.  These shares vest   one   year after the date of the award. 
  On January 26, 2016, the Committee approved a grant of   136,623   restricted common shares and   277,386   RSUs at target to the Company s officers, certain employees and to Mr. Zell, the Chairman of our Board of Trustees, as part of their compensation for fiscal year 2015.    
  The restricted shares are service based awards and vest over a   four  -year period. The restricted shares were granted on January 26, 2016 and were valued at   $26.93   per share, the closing price of our common shares on the NYSE on that day.  
  The RSUs are market based awards with a service condition and recipients may earn the RSU grants based on the Company s total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR's for the constituent REITs that comprise the NAREIT Office Index for the performance period of January 26, 2016 - January 26, 2019.  Following the end of the performance period on January 26, 2019, the number of earned awards will be determined.  The earned awards vest in   two   tranches with   50%   of the earned award vesting on January 26, 2019 and the remaining   50%   of the earned award vesting on January 26, 2020, subject to the grant recipient s continued employment.  Compensation expense for the RSU awards was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and is being recognized ratably from the grant date to the vesting date of each tranche.   
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to employee departures,   539   restricted shares were forfeited with an average price per share value at grant date of   $26.82  , and   1,094   RSUs were forfeited with an average per share fair value at grant date of   $38.72  . 
    
  2015 Equity Award Activity 
    
  On June 16, 2015, in accordance with the Company s compensation plan for independent Trustees, the Committee awarded each of the   nine   independent Trustees   $0.1 million   in restricted shares as part of their compensation for the 2015-2016 year of service on the Board of Trustees.  These awards equated to   3,843   shares per Trustee, for a total of   34,587   shares, valued at   $26.02   per share, the closing price of our common shares on the NYSE on that day.  These shares vested   one   year after the date of the award. 
  On January 28, 2015, the Committee approved a grant of   126,319   restricted common shares and   256,467   RSUs at target to the Company s officers, certain employees and to Mr. Zell, the Chairman of our Board of Trustees, as part of their compensation for fiscal year 2014.    
  The restricted shares are service based awards and vest over a   four  -year period. The restricted shares were granted on January 28, 2015 and were valued at   $26.58   per share, the closing price of our common shares on the NYSE on that day.  
  The RSUs are market based awards with a service condition and recipients may earn the RSU grants based on the Company s total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR's for the constituent REITs that comprise the NAREIT Office Index for the performance period of January 28, 2015 - January 28, 2018.  Following the end of the performance period on January 28, 2018, the number of earned awards will be determined.  The earned awards vest in   two   tranches with   50%   of the earned award vesting on January 28, 2018 and the remaining   50%   of the earned award vesting on January 28, 2019, subject to the grant recipient s continued employment.  Compensation expense for the RSU awards was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and is being recognized ratably from the grant date to the vesting date of each tranche.   
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015,   8,115   restricted shares were forfeited with an average per share fair value at grant date of   $26.64  , and   16,475   RSUs were forfeited with an average per share fair value at grant date of   $20.50  .

Outstanding Equity Awards 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated future compensation expense for all unvested restricted share grants was   $14.1 million  . Compensation expense for the restricted share awards is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The weighted average period over which the future compensation expense will be recorded for the restricted shares is approximately   2.3   years.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated future compensation expense for all unvested RSUs was   $22.2 million  . The weighted average period over which the future compensation expense will be recorded for the RSUs is approximately   2.2   years.  
  The assumptions and fair values for the RSUs granted for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are included in the following table on a per share basis.  

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded   $4.9 million   and   $3.7 million  , respectively, and during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded   $13.9 million   and   $11.8 million  , respectively, of compensation expense, net of forfeitures, in general and administrative expense for grants to our Board of Trustees and the Company's employees related to our Plan. At   September 30, 2016  ,   2,358,464   common shares remain available for issuance under the Plan.

Effective Portion of Interest Rate Swap and Cap Contracts 
    
  The fair value of our interest rate swap and cap contracts is determined using the net discounted cash flows of each derivative based on the market based interest rate curve (level 2 inputs) and adjusted for our credit spread and the actual and estimated credit spreads of the counterparties (level 3 inputs).  Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and the counterparties.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.  As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified as level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.

Derivative Liability 
    
  On July 31, 2014, our shareholders voted to approve the reimbursement of verified expenses incurred by Related Fund Management, LLC and Corvex Management LP (Related/Corvex) (see Note 14 for additional information).  Approximately   $16.7 million   was paid during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Up to   $8.4 million   was to be reimbursed only if the average closing price of our common shares was at least   $26.00   (as adjusted for any share splits or share dividends) during the   one   year period after the date on which the reimbursement was approved by shareholders, and up to   $8.4 million   was to be reimbursed only if the average closing price of our common shares was at least   $26.00   (as adjusted for any share splits or share dividends) during the one year period between the first and second anniversaries of the date on which the reimbursement was approved by shareholders.  The average closing price of our common shares was at least   $26.00   during both the first and second one year periods after the date on which the reimbursement was approved by shareholders, and as a result, in August 2016 and 2015 we paid an   $8.2 million   final payment and   $8.4 million  , respectively, to Related/Corvex.   
    
  Prior to the payment of the reimbursement in August 2016, the potential future reimbursement of   $8.4 million   for the second one year period represented a derivative instrument as codified in ASC 815   Derivatives and Hedging   which required the potential future reimbursement to be recorded at fair value at each reporting date.  The fair value of the derivative liability as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 was   $0   and   $7.2 million  , respectively.  We recognized (income) expense of   $(0.1) million   and   $1.0 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for such periods.  
    
  Properties Held and Used 
    
  As part of our disposition plan, and pursuant to our accounting policy, in 2016, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying values of each of the real estate assets that comprised our portfolio and determined that due to the shortening of the expected periods of ownership as a result of the disposition plan and current estimates of market value, it was necessary to reduce the net book value of a portion of the real estate assets in our portfolio to their estimated fair values.  We anticipate the potential disposition of certain properties prior to the end of their remaining useful lives. As a result, in the second quarter, we recorded an impairment charge related to 111 Monument Circle, 101-115 W. Washington Street and 100 East Wisconsin Avenue of   $43.7 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.  We determined these impairments based on third party offer prices and independent third party broker information, which are level 2 inputs according to the fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820.  We reduced the aggregate carrying value of these properties from   $308.6 million   to their estimated fair value of   $264.9 million  .  These properties were sold in August 2016 (see Note 3 for additional information).  We evaluated each of our properties and determined there were no additional valuation adjustments necessary at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Financial Instruments 
    
  In addition to the assets and liabilities described in the above table, our financial instruments include our cash and cash equivalents, real estate mortgages receivable, restricted cash, senior unsecured debt and mortgage notes payable.  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the fair value of these additional financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying values, except as follows (in thousands):  

The fair values of our senior notes and mortgage notes payable are based on estimates using discounted cash flow analyses and currently prevailing interest rates adjusted by credit risk spreads (level 3 inputs). 
    
  Our cash and cash equivalents consists of cash maintained in time deposits, depository accounts and money market accounts.  From time-to-time we may also invest in various U.S. government securities.  We continually monitor the credit ratings of the financial institutions holding our deposits to minimize our exposure to credit risk.  Throughout the year, we have cash balances in excess of federally insured limits deposited with various financial institutions. We do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.

Other financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of rents receivable; however, as of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   single tenant of ours is responsible for more than   5.5%   of our total annualized rents. 
    
  Our derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and cap, are entered with major financial institutions and we monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.

  Our primary business is the ownership and operation of office properties, and we currently have   one   reportable segment.

OVERVIEW 
    
  We are an internally managed and self-advised REIT engaged in the ownership and operation primarily of office buildings throughout the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio, excluding properties held for sale, included   37   properties (  67   buildings) with a combined   16.7 million   square feet for a total investment of   $2.9 billion   at cost and a depreciated book value of   $2.2 billion  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our overall portfolio was   91.2%   leased. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered into leases for   237,000   square feet, including lease renewals for   46,000   square feet and new leases for   191,000   square feet.  Renewal leases entered into during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   had weighted average cash and GAAP rental rates that were approximately   14.6%   higher and   24.2%   higher, respectively, as compared to prior rental rates for the same space, and new leases entered into during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   had weighted average cash and GAAP rental rates that were approximately   12.6%   lower and   3.4%   higher, respectively, than prior rental rates for the same space.  The change in GAAP rents is different than the change in cash rents due to differences in the amount of rent abatements, the magnitude and timing of contractual rent increases over the lease term, and the years of term for the newly executed leases compared to the prior leases. 
    
  Throughout 2016, our management team has continued to focus on executing our plan to reshape our portfolio in order to create long-term value for shareholders. We are continuing to dispose of properties that do not meet our long-term goals. Specifically, we continue to implement the strategy adopted by our Board of Trustees to consider disposing of assets that have one or more of the following attributes:  

assets that do not offer an opportunity to create a competitive advantage;  
                 
    assets that are not office buildings;  
                
    assets that are not located in the U.S.; or  
                
    assets that produce a low cash yield or require significant capital expenditures.

We are in the process of executing this strategy and, depending on market conditions, will likely sell additional properties. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of 91 properties (135 buildings) and one land parcel with a combined 18.9 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $2.0 billion, excluding closing costs.   
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   27   properties (  56   buildings) with a combined   7.2 million   square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of   $1.1 billion  , excluding closing costs. In October 2016, we sold   one   property (  four   buildings), with   151,917   square feet for   $29.2 million  , excluding closing costs.  This property was classified as held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . For more information regarding this transaction, see Notes 3 and 15 to the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.  
    
  We have generated significant proceeds from our dispositions to date and have a cash balance of   $2.4 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . We expect to reinvest the capital received from dispositions to purchase new properties, repay debt, buy back common shares or make other investments or distributions that further our long-term strategic goals.  However, we may not be able to make suitable acquisitions or other investments with the proceeds from the dispositions. In addition, as our real estate investments have decreased, our income from operations has also declined.  
    
  As part of the disposition plan noted above, and pursuant to our accounting policy, in 2016, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying values of each of the real estate assets that comprised our portfolio and determined that due to the shortening of the expected periods of ownership as a result of the disposition plan and current estimates of market value, it was necessary to reduce the net book value of a portion of the real estate assets in our portfolio to their estimated fair values. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of   $43.7 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.  
    
  The Board of Trustees intends to make a decision about declaring a dividend on our common shares of beneficial ownership after evaluation of the Company's taxable income, including gains or losses from asset sales.  The Board of Trustees has regularly reviewed our dividend policy and will continue to do so, at least annually.  
    
  We have engaged CBRE, Inc. (CBRE) to provide property management services for our properties.  We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties.  We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs.  
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred expenses of $6.3 million and $9.8 million, respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred expenses of $20.6 million and $34.6 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a portion of the properties' revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of $3.5 million. 
    
  Property Operations 
    
  Leased occupancy data for   2016   and   2015   are as follows (square feet in thousands):

    Excludes properties sold or classified as held for sale in the period.   
              (2) 
    Based on properties owned continuously from   January 1, 2015   through   September 30, 2016  , and excludes properties sold or classified as held for sale during the period. 
              (3) 
    Percent leased includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants.

The weighted average lease term based on square feet for leases entered into during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   7.4   years.  Commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, for leases entered into during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $11.0 million  , or   $47.06   per square foot on average (approximately   $6.37   per square foot per year of the lease term). 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   1.5%   of our leased square feet and   0.6%   of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31,   2016  .  Renewed and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be relet in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated.  We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring for the remainder of   2016   are slightly above market. Lease expirations by year, as of   September 30, 2016  , are as follows (square feet and dollars in thousands):  

(1) 
    Square footage is pursuant to existing leases as of   September 30, 2016  , excluding leases related to properties classified as held for sale, and includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease.   
              (2) 
    Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of   September 30, 2016  , plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; includes triple net lease rents and excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, abated ("free") rent periods and parking revenue.  We calculate annualized rental revenue by aggregating the recurring billings outlined above for the most recent month during the quarter reported, adding abated rent, and multiplying the sum by 12 to provide an estimation of near-term potentially-recurring revenues.  Annualized rental revenue is a forward-looking non-GAAP measure.  Annualized rental revenue cannot be reconciled to a comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, primarily due to the fact that it is calculated from the billings of tenants in the most recent month at the most recent rental rates during the quarter reported, whereas historical GAAP measures include billings from a potentially different group of tenants over multiple months at potentially different rental rates.

A principal source of funds for our operations is rents from tenants at our properties.  Rents are generally received from our tenants monthly in advance, except from our government tenants, who usually pay rents monthly in arrears.  As of   September 30, 2016  , tenants representing 1% or more of our total annualized rental revenue were as follows (square feet in thousands):  

(1) 
    Tenants located in properties classified as held for sale are excluded. 
              (2) 
    Square footage is pursuant to existing leases as of   September 30, 2016  , and includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease.   
              (3) 
    Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of   September 30, 2016  , plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; includes triple net lease rents and excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, abated ("free") rent periods and parking revenue.

  Financing Activities 
    
  On May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of   $25.00   per share, for a total of $275.0 million, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.  The redemption payment occurred on May 16, 2016 (the first business day following the redemption date).  
    
  On February 16, 2016, we redeemed at par $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.1 million   from the write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing fees for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

    Other properties consist of properties sold and classified as held for sale. 
       
           (3) 
    We calculate net operating income, or NOI, as shown above.  We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses.  NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions.  We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties.  We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs.  NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs.  This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows.  Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do. 
       
  We refer to the   37   properties (  67   buildings) we owned continuously from   July 1, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , as comparable properties.  We refer to the sold properties and properties classified as held for sale as other properties.  Our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   include the operating results of   37   properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of   July 1, 2015  .   
    
  Rental income.      Rental income decreased   $32.7 million  , or   26.1%  , in the   2016   period, compared to the   2015   period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by an increase of   5.3%   in rental income at the comparable properties. The increase in rental income at the comparable properties is primarily due to charges against revenue of $2.8 million recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to a one-time parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue in the 2015 period.  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

Rental income includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling   $3.0 million   in the   2016   period and   $1.9 million   in the   2015   period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling   $0.9 million   in the   2016   period and   $2.8 million   in the   2015   period.  Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling   $1.8 million   in the   2016   period and   $1.8 million   in the   2015   period.   
     
  Tenant reimbursements and other income.    Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased   $11.8 million  , or   35.1%  , in the   2016   period, compared to the   2015   period primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015.  Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased   $2.0 million  , or   9.6%  , at our comparable properties primarily due to a decrease in real estate tax reimbursements.  
    
  Operating expenses.    The   $24.3 million  , or   33.0%  , decrease in operating expenses during the   2016   period as compared to the   2015   period is due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015.  Operating expenses increased   $0.2 million  , or   0.4%  , at the comparable properties primarily due to increases in maintenance and repairs, partially offset by a decrease in real estate tax expense. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization.    The   $11.3 million  , or   28.0%  , decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during the   2016   period as compared to the   2015   period primarily relates to properties sold in 2016 and 2015. 
    
  General and administrative.   The   $3.0 million  , or   18.3%  , decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to a $5.8 million decrease in shareholder litigation and transition-related expenses, partially offset by $1.7 million of compensation expenses in the 2016 period related to a staffing reduction, and a $1.0 million increase in share-based compensation expense.  
    
  Operating income.    The decrease of   $6.0 million  , or   20.8%  , in operating income is primarily due to lower net operating income as a result of our smaller size portfolio of assets, partially offset by lower depreciation expense as a result of our smaller size portfolio of assets.   
    
  Interest and other income.    The increase of   $2.4 million   of interest and other income in the   2016   period as compared to the 2015 period primarily reflects additional interest received on higher cash balances in the current year.  
    
  Interest expense.    The decrease of   $3.7 million  , or   14.7%  , in interest expense primarily reflects the defeasance of the outstanding $141.4 million balance of the mortgage debt secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in the Illinois Center disposition, in August 2015, the repayment of the $116.0 mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle in December 2015 and the prepayment of $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes in February 2016, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of net mortgage debt premiums. 
    
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt  .  The loss on early extinguishment of debt in the 2015 period reflects a $3.9 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in the Illinois Center disposition. 
    
  Foreign currency exchange loss.    The foreign currency exchange loss for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   relates to the translation of the proceeds from the sale of the Australian portfolio that were held in an Australian bank account. 
    
  Gain on sale of properties.    Gain on sale of properties increased   $42.4 million   in the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period due to gains in 2016 of   $78.2 million  ,   $4.7 million  ,   $8.4 million  , and   $7.2 million   related to the sales of 111 River Street, Sky Park Centre, 8701 N Mopac and the South Carolina industrial portfolio, respectively.  These gains were partially offset by losses in the third quarter of 2016 of   $0.7 million   and   $15.8 million   related to the sales of Raintree Industrial Park and the Midwest portfolio, respectively.  
    
  In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $26.9 million, $17.6 million and $7.9 million related to the sales of Illinois Center, 185 Asylum Street and 16th and Race Street, respectively. These gains were partially offset by a loss in the third quarter of $12.5 million related to the sale of a portfolio in upstate New York. 
    
  Income tax expense.    The   $0.2 million   increase in income tax expense primarily relates to an increase in state taxes due to the sale of properties in the state of South Carolina. 
    
  Preferred distributions.    The   $5.0 million   decrease in preferred distributions relates to the redemption of all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares on May 15, 2016.

  We refer to the   37   properties (  67   buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2015 to   September 30, 2016  , as comparable properties.  We refer to the sold properties and properties classified as held for sale as other properties.  Our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   include the operating results of   37   properties for the entire periods, as we owned these properties as of January 1, 2015.   
    
  Rental income.      Rental income decreased   $132.8 million  , or   29.0%  , in the 2016 period, compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by an increase of   3.9%   in rental income at the comparable properties.  The increase in rental income at the comparable properties is due to leasing activity in 2015 at a particular building where one tenant vacated its space and two tenants shortened their remaining lease terms.  In connection with these leasing transactions, the corresponding deferred rent receivable balances were written off or amortized over the shorter term, resulting in a decrease in rental income in the 2015 period. The increase in rental income at the comparable properties is also due to charges against revenue of $2.7 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to a one-time parking tax matter and a tenant lease termination at 600 West Chicago Avenue in the 2015 period.   
    
  Rental income includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling   $12.4 million   in the 2016 period and   $3.6 million   in the 2015 period, and net reductions for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling   $5.9 million   in the 2016 period and   $6.0 million   in the 2015 period.  Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling   $19.6 million   in the 2016 period, which includes the $18.0 million lease termination fee received at 111 Monument Circle, and   $7.9 million   in the 2015 period.

Tenant reimbursements and other income.    Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased   $46.0 million  , or   38.7%  , in the 2016 period, compared to the 2015 period primarily due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015.  Tenant reimbursements and other income decreased   $5.7 million  , or   9.2%  , at our comparable properties primarily due to a decrease in utility reimbursements as a result of the milder winter in 2016, a decrease in real estate tax reimbursements and a bankruptcy settlement received in the prior year. 
    
  Operating expenses.    The   $103.2 million  , or   39.5%  , decrease in operating expenses during the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period is due to the properties sold in 2016 and 2015.  Operating expenses decreased   $1.6 million  , or   1.3%  , at our comparable properties primarily due to a decrease in utility expense as a result of the milder winter in 2016, a decrease in real estate tax expense and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by increases in maintenance and repairs. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization.    The   $54.1 million  , or   34.5%  , decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period primarily relates to properties sold in 2015 and 2016. 
    
  General and administrative.   The decrease of   $5.0 million  , or   11.3%  , in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to a $5.9 million decrease related to the shareholder approved reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex in connection with their consent solicitation to remove our former Trustees, a decrease of $2.6 million of expenses related to the termination and cooperation agreement with RMR, and a $1.7 million decrease in litigation costs, partially offset by an increase of $1.9 million for share-based compensation expense, $1.7 million of compensation expenses in the 2016 period related to a staffing reduction, an increase of $0.8 million in legal costs, and a $0.6 million increase in technology expenses due to a software upgrade.  
    
  Loss on asset impairment.    The increase of   $26.6 million   in loss on asset impairment is due to additional charges that we incurred in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the 2015 period.  We recorded impairment charges of   $43.7 million   in the 2016 period related to 111 Monument Circle, 101-115 W. Washington Street and 100 East Wisconsin Avenue, based upon the shortening of our expected periods of ownership as a result of our disposition plan and updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded impairment charges of $17.2 million related to 12655 Olive Boulevard, 1285 Fern Ridge Parkway and portfolios of properties located in Georgia and New York, based upon updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures.   
    
  Operating income.    The decrease of   $43.2 million  , or   44.5%  , in operating income is primarily due to lower net operating income as a result of our smaller size portfolio of assets and an increase in the loss on asset impairment. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by a lease termination fee of $18.0 million received at 111 Monument Circle in the 2016 period and lower depreciation expense as a result of our smaller size portfolio of assets.   
    
  Interest and other income.    The increase of   $2.4 million   of interest and other income in the 2016 period primarily reflects interest received on higher cash balances in the current year.  Interest and other income in the 2015 period primarily reflects a $3.1 million gain on the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2015.     
    
  Interest expense.    The decrease of   $17.9 million  , or   21.5%  , in interest expense primarily reflects the prepayment of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes in May 2015, the foreclosure of the $40.1 million mortgage debt balance secured by 225 Water Street in May 2015, the defeasance of the outstanding $141.4 million balance of the mortgage debt secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in the Illinois Center disposition, in August 2015, the repayment of the $116.0 mortgage debt at 111 Monument Circle in December 2015 and the prepayment of $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes in February 2016, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of net mortgage debt premiums.  
    
  (Loss) gain on early extinguishment of debt  .  We had a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a gain on early extinguishment of debt of   $6.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The loss on early extinguishment in the 2016 period reflects the write-off of an unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing fees related to our redemption of $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2016.  The gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2015 period reflects a $17.3 million gain related to the 225 Water Street foreclosure, partially offset by a $6.2 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 1320 Main Street, a $3.9 million loss related to the defeasance of the mortgage loan secured by 111 East Wacker Drive, one of the buildings included in the Illinois Center disposition, a $0.6 million loss related to the prepayment of mortgage debt at 2501 20th Place South, a $0.1 million loss related to the redemption of $138.8 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2015 and a $0.4 million loss related to the termination of our prior credit agreement.

Foreign currency exchange loss.    The foreign currency exchange loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   relates to the translation of proceeds from the sale of the Australian portfolio that were held in an Australian bank account. 
    
  Gain on sale of properties.    Gain on sale of properties increased   $182.3 million   in the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period due to a   $16.5 million   gain on the sale of Executive Park, a   $5.5 million   gain on the sale of 3330 N Washington Boulevard, a   $14.7 million   gain on the sale of 111 East Kilbourn Avenue, a $9.0 million gain on the sale of 1525 Locust Street, a $16.0 million gain on the sale of 633 Ahua Street, a $13.6 million gain on the sale of Lakewood on the Park, a $15.9 million gain on the sale of leased land, a $20.6 million gain on the sale of the downtown Austin portfolio, a $30.6 million gain on the sale of the movie theater portfolio and a $0.6 million gain on the sale of 9110 East Nichols Avenue. In the third quarter of 2016 we recorded gains of   $78.2 million  ,   $4.7 million  ,   $8.4 million  , and   $7.2 million   related to the sales of 111 River Street, Sky Park Centre, 8701 N Mopac and the South Carolina industrial portfolio, respectively.  These gains were partially offset by losses in the third quarter of 2016 of   $0.7 million   and   $15.8 million   related to the sales of Raintree Industrial Park and the Midwest portfolio, respectively. 
    
  In the first quarter of 2015, we sold two properties and recorded a $5.9 million gain on sale of properties. In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $41.6 million and $11.9 million related to the sales of an office portfolio in AL, LA, NC, SC and Sorrento Valley Business Park, respectively.  In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded gains of $26.9 million, $17.6 million and $7.9 million related to the sales of Illinois Center, 185 Asylum Street and 16th and Race Street, respectively.  These gains were partially offset by a loss in the second quarter on the sale of properties in Australia of $47.9 million, which is net of the write off of approximately $63.2 million of foreign currency translation adjustments previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We also recognized losses in the second quarter of $8.1 million and $2.3 million related to sales of a portfolio of small office and industrial properties and two properties in St. Louis, respectively, and a loss in the third quarter of $12.5 million related to the sale of a portfolio in upstate New York.  
    
  Income tax expense.    The   $1.9 million   decrease in income tax expense primarily relates to a decrease in foreign tax expense due to the sale of the Australian assets in 2015 and federal income tax expense incurred in 2015 as a result of a taxable built-in gain triggered by the sale of a property that was previously owned by a C corporation.  
    
  Preferred distributions.    The   $5.0 million   decrease in preferred distributions relates to the redemption of all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares on May 15, 2016.  
    
  Excess fair value of consideration paid over carrying value of preferred shares.    On May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our 11,000,000 outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of   $25.00   per share and recorded   $9.6 million   related to the excess fair value of consideration paid over the carrying value of the preferred shares as a reduction to net income attributable to common shareholders for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Our Operating Liquidity and Resources 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.4 billion   of cash and cash equivalents.  We expect to use our cash balances, cash flow from our operations and proceeds of future property sales to fund our operations, repay debt, make distributions, purchase our common shares, acquire assets, fund tenant improvements and leasing costs and for other general business purposes.  We believe our cash balances and the cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to fund our ordinary course activities. 
    
  Our future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our: 
    
     ability to maintain or improve the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties; 
    
     ability to control operating and financing cost increases at our properties; and 

ability to purchase additional properties which produce rents, less property operating expenses, in excess of our costs of acquisition capital. 
       
  Volatility in energy costs and real estate taxes may cause our future operating costs to fluctuate; however, the impact of these fluctuations is expected to be partially offset by the pass through of operating costs to our tenants pursuant to lease terms,  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset these costs or that doing so would not negatively impact our competitive position or business.   
    
  Cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were   $116.7 million  ,   $943.9 million   and   $(458.2) million  , respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   $141.4 million  ,   $1,411.7 million   and   $(258.9) million  , respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Changes in these three categories of our cash flows between 2016 and 2015 are primarily related to real estate improvements, our dispositions of properties, our purchase of our common shares and our redemption of our preferred shares. 
    
  Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources 
    
  In order to maintain financial flexibility, to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of rents and our desire or need to make distributions and investments or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders.  Our credit agreement provides us with (i) a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) a $200.0 million 5-year term loan facility and (iii) a $200.0 million 7-year term loan facility. The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 28, 2019, which maturity date may be extended for up to two additional periods of six months at our option subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee of 0.075% of the aggregate amount available under the revolving credit facility. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan have scheduled maturity dates of January 28, 2020 and January 28, 2022, respectively. We used the proceeds of borrowings under the credit agreement to repay all amounts outstanding and due under the previous term loan agreement. 
    
  Borrowings under our revolving credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, which was 125 basis points as of   September 30, 2016  .  We also pay a facility fee of 25 basis points per annum on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility.  Both the interest rate spread and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings.  We are allowed to borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was   1.78%  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  Our term loans currently bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread, which was 140 and 180 basis points for the 5-year and 7-year term loan, respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  .  The interest rate spread is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate for the amounts outstanding under our term loan was   1.93%   and   2.33%   for the 5-year and 7-year term loan, respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our 5-year and 7-year term loans each had outstanding balances of $200.0 million. 
    
  On February 16, 2016, we redeemed at par $139.1 million of our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2016.  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid an aggregate of   $16.0 million   of distributions on our series D and series E preferred shares.  On May 15, 2016, we redeemed all of our   11,000,000   outstanding series E preferred shares at a price of   $25.00   per share, for a total of   $275.0 million  , plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.  The redemption payment occurred on May 16, 2016 (the first business day following the redemption date). On October 10, 2016, we announced that our Board of Trustees declared a dividend of $0.40625 per series D preferred share, which is expected to be paid on November 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on October 28, 2016. 
    
  On March 17, 2016, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $150.0 million of our outstanding common shares over the twelve month period following the date of authorization. This is in addition to the $200.0 million previously authorized by our Board of Trustees in 2015.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased and retired   983,789   of our common shares at a weighted average price of   $25.94   per share for a total investment of   $25.5 million  .  Since the inception of the common share repurchase plan through September 30, 2016, we have purchased and retired a total of   4,394,089   of our common shares at a weighted average price of   $25.80   per share, for a total of   $113.4 million  .  In August and September 2016, the first two share repurchase authorizations, of which $86.6 million was not utilized, expired.  The   $150.0 million   of remaining authorization available under our share repurchase program as of September 30, 2016 is scheduled to expire in March 2017.

    On November 1, 2016, we delivered notice of our intent to redeem at par our $250 million 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2017 on December 15, 2016.  The notes will be redeemed for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
              (4) 
    We have a mortgage loan with an aggregate outstanding principal balance as of   September 30, 2016   of   $168,103   secured by 1735 Market Street that matures in 2019. Interest on this loan is payable at a rate equal to a spread over LIBOR, but the interest rate has been fixed by a cash flow hedge which sets the rate at approximately 5.66% per year until December 1, 2016. 
        
  For a description of our financing activities since January 1, 2016, see  Financing Activities  above.  Also, for further information about our indebtedness, see Note 5 to the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
  When significant amounts are outstanding under our revolving credit facility, or as the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach, we explore alternatives to repay amounts due. Such alternatives may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities, extending the maturity of our revolving credit facility and entering into a new revolving credit facility. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities.  
  We believe that we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity offerings, to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations as they become due. The completion and the costs of our future debt transactions will depend primarily upon market conditions and our credit ratings. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans and, in particular, whether we appear to have the ability to maintain our earnings, to space our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably foreseeable adverse changes. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will continue to afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities. However, there can be no assurance regarding our credit ratings or our ability to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   27   properties (  56   buildings) with a combined   7,222,691   square feet for an aggregate sales price of   $1.1 billion  , excluding closing costs. In October 2016, we sold   one   property (  four   buildings), with   151,917   square feet for   $29.2 million  , excluding closing costs.  This property was classified as held for sale as

  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , amounts capitalized at our properties, including properties sold, for tenant improvements, leasing costs and building improvements were as follows (amounts in thousands):  

(1) 
    Tenant improvements include capital expenditures to improve tenants  spaces. 
              (2) 
    Leasing costs primarily include brokerage commissions and legal expenses. 
              (3) 
    Building improvements generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components and expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets.  Tenant-funded capital expenditures are excluded. 
       
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , commitments made for expenditures in connection with leasing space at our properties were as follows (dollar and square foot measures in thousands):  

Debt Covenants 
    
  Our unsecured debt obligations at   September 30, 2016   were our term loans and our publicly issued senior unsecured notes. Our public debt indenture and related supplements, our revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts, in excess of calculated amounts, restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other financial ratios.  At   September 30, 2016  , we believe we were in compliance with all covenants under both our indenture and related supplements, and under our revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement.  In addition to our unsecured debt obligations, we had   $244.0 million   (including net unamortized premiums and discounts and net unamortized deferred financing costs) of mortgage notes outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  None of our indenture and related supplements, our revolving credit facility and term loan agreement, or our mortgage notes contain provisions for acceleration or require us to provide collateral security which could be triggered by our debt ratings.  However, our senior debt rating is used to determine the interest rate and the fees payable under our revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement. 
    
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  We had no swaps or hedges as of   September 30, 2016  , other than the cash flow hedges associated with our   $168.1 million   of mortgage debt and $400.0 million of our floating rate debt described in Note 9 to the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, under  Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources  above in Part I, Item 2 and under  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  included in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report. 
    
  Funds from Operations (FFO) and Normalized FFO 
    
  We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).  NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate depreciation  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, impairment of depreciable real estate, and our portion of these items related to equity investees and non-controlling interests.  Our calculation of Normalized FFO differs from NAREIT s definition of FFO because we exclude certain items that we view as nonrecurring or impacting comparability from period to period.  We consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income and cash flow from operating activities.  
    
  We believe that FFO and Normalized FFO provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO and Normalized FFO may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs.  FFO and Normalized FFO do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs.  These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.  Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.

Property Net Operating Income (NOI)  
    
  We use property net operating income, or NOI, to evaluate the performance of our properties.  We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses. 
    
  The following table includes the reconciliation of NOI to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our consolidated financial statements.  We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because we believe it helps to understand the operations of our properties.  We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs.  NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs.  This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows.  Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
    
  We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates, as set forth below. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. Other than as described below, we do not currently foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding fixed rate debt consisted of the following senior unsecured notes and secured mortgage notes (dollars in thousands): 
    
  Senior Unsecured Notes: 

(1) 
    The principal balance, annual interest rate and annual interest expense are the amounts stated in the applicable contracts.  In accordance with GAAP, our carrying values and recorded interest expense may differ from these amounts because of market conditions and issuance costs at the time we issued these debts.  For more information, see Note 5 to the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report. 
              (2) 
    On November 1, 2016, we delivered notice of our intent to redeem at par our $250 million 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2017 on December 15, 2016.  The notes will be redeemed for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
       
  No principal repayments are due under our senior unsecured notes until maturity. 
    
  Secured Mortgage Notes: 

(1) 
    The principal balance, annual interest rate and annual interest expense are the amounts stated in the applicable contracts.  In accordance with GAAP, our carrying values and recorded interest expense may differ from these amounts because of market conditions and issuance costs at the time we assumed or issued these debts.  For more information, see Note 5 to the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report. 
       
           (2) 
    Interest on this loan is payable at a rate equal to a spread over LIBOR, but the interest rate has been fixed by a cash flow hedge which sets the rate at approximately 5.66% until December 1, 2016.  The floating interest rate at   September 30, 2016   was 3.16%.  The open at par date in the table above reflects the swap expiration date, as the debt at 1735 Market Street is otherwise open for repayment. 

35 

     Table of Contents  

Some of our secured notes require principal and interest payments through maturity pursuant to amortization schedules, and one of our secured notes require interest only payments through maturity. 
    
  Swap Agreements 
    
  We have interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure on   $168.1 million   of mortgage notes due 2019, which require us to pay interest at a rate equal to a spread over LIBOR.  These interest rate swap agreements effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk arising from this floating rate mortgage loan by converting this floating rate debt to a fixed rate through December 1, 2016, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense.  These agreements involve the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements.  Approximately   10.8%   (  $168.1 million  ) of our total outstanding debt had interest payments designated as hedged transactions to interest rate swap agreements at   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our derivative instruments included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and cumulative other comprehensive loss in our condensed consolidated balance sheet totaled   $0.7 million  . 
    
  Cap Agreement 
    
  We entered into an interest rate cap agreement on March 4, 2016, effective April 1, 2016, to manage our interest rate risk exposure on $400.0 million of floating rate debt, which requires us to pay interest at a rate equal to a spread over LIBOR.  The interest rate cap has a maturity date of March 1, 2019.  From and after the effective date, this interest rate cap agreement reduces our exposure to variability in expected future cash outflows attributable to changes in LIBOR, relating to a portion of our outstanding floating rate debt, by protecting us from increases in the hedged cash flows on our floating rate debt attributable to changes in LIBOR above the strike rate of the interest rate cap. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our derivative instruments included in other assets and cumulative other comprehensive loss in our condensed consolidated balance sheet totaled   $0.1 million  . 
    
  Fixed Rate Debt 
    
  Because our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes bear interest at fixed rates, changes in market interest rates during the term of these debts will not affect our interest obligations.  If all of these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are 100 basis points higher or lower than shown above, our per annum interest cost would increase or decrease, respectively, by approximately $11.7 million. 
    
  Each of our fixed rate unsecured debt arrangements and some of our secured debt arrangements allow us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date.  In some cases, we are not allowed to make early repayment prior to a cutoff date, and we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at a premium equal to a make whole amount, as defined, which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder.  Also, we have repurchased and retired some of our outstanding debts and we may do so again in the future.  These prepayment rights and our ability to repurchase and retire outstanding debt may afford us opportunities to mitigate the risk of refinancing our debts at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity. 
    
  Floating Rate Debt 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding floating rate debt consisted of our term loans.  Our $200.0 million 5-year term loan matures in January 2020 and our $200.0 million 7-year term loan matures in January 2022.  Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are in U.S. dollars and bear interest at LIBOR plus spreads that are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings, but as of   September 30, 2016  , we had no balance outstanding and $750.0 million available under our revolving credit facility.  Accordingly, we are vulnerable to changes in U.S. dollar based short term rates, specifically LIBOR.  Effective April 1, 2016, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with respect to $400.0 million of floating rate debt, as described above under  Cap Agreement.  In addition, upon renewal or refinancing of our revolving credit facility or term loan, we are vulnerable to increases in interest rates due to market conditions or our perceived credit risk.  Generally, a change in market interest rates would not affect the value of these floating rate debts, but would affect our operating results.

  Foreign Currency Risk  
    
  Prior to the sale of our Australian portfolio, there was a risk that our financial results were affected by changes in currency exchange rates.  As a result of the sale of our Australian portfolio, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates subsequent to the June 2015 disposition related to the translation of the cash and cash equivalent balance at our Australian subsidiary from Australian dollars into U.S. dollars.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we no longer have any foreign currency risk. 
   
  Item 4.  Controls and Procedures. 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
