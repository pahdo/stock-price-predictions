TRIANGLE CAPITAL CORPORATION 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
  Organization and Business 
  Triangle Capital Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including Triangle Mezzanine Fund LLLP ( Triangle SBIC ) and Triangle Mezzanine Fund II LP ( Triangle SBIC II ) (collectively, the  Company ), are specialty finance companies. Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II are specialty finance limited partnerships formed to make investments primarily in lower middle market companies located throughout the United States. On September 11, 2003, Triangle SBIC was licensed to operate as a Small Business Investment Company ( SBIC ) under the authority of the United States Small Business Administration ( SBA ). On May 26, 2010, Triangle SBIC II obtained its license to operate as an SBIC. As SBICs, both Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II are subject to a variety of regulations concerning, among other things, the size and nature of the companies in which they may invest and the structure of those investments. 
  The Company currently operates as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company and has elected to be treated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). The Company is internally managed by its executive officers under the supervision of its Board of Directors. The Company does not pay management or advisory fees, but instead incurs the operating costs associated with employing executive management and investment and portfolio management professionals. Triangle SBIC has also elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Triangle Capital Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II. The effects of all intercompany transactions between Triangle Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X and Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 946,   Financial Services - Investment Companies  , the Company is precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments, including those in which it has a controlling interest, unless the portfolio company is another investment company. An exception to this general principle occurs if the Company holds a controlling interest in an operating company that provides all or substantially all of its services directly to the Company or to its portfolio companies. None of the portfolio investments made by the Company qualify for this exception. Therefore, the Company's investment portfolio is carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, as discussed further in Note 2, with any adjustments to fair value recognized as  Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)  on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  The accompanying unaudited financial statements are presented in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period, have been reflected in the unaudited consolidated financial statements. The current period s results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the year. Additionally, the unaudited financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Financial statements prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. 
   
  2. INVESTMENTS 
  Portfolio Composition  
  The Company primarily invests in subordinated debt securities of privately held companies, generally secured by second lien security interests in portfolio company assets. In addition, the Company generally invests in an equity instrument of the borrower, such as warrants to purchase common stock in the portfolio company or direct preferred or common equity interests. On a more limited basis, the Company also invests in senior debt securities secured by first lien security interests in portfolio companies. The Company's investments generally range from $5.0 million to $35.0 million per portfolio company.

The cost basis of the Company's debt investments includes any unamortized original issue discount, unamortized loan origination fees and payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest, if any. Summaries of the composition of the Company s investment portfolio at cost and fair value, and as a percentage of total investments, are shown in the following tables: 

During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company made three new investments totaling approximately $83.9 million and investments in nine existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $4.5 million. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company made six new investments totaling approximately $130.2 million and investments in seventeen existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $33.7 million.  
  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company made eleven new investments totaling approximately $157.9 million and investments in nine existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $31.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company made eighteen new investments totaling approximately $289.2 million and investments in fifteen existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $63.3 million. 
  Investment Valuation Process 
  The Company has established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring basis in accordance with the 1940 Act and FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC Topic 820 ). Under ASC Topic 820, a financial instrument is categorized within the ASC Topic 820 valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input to the valuation process that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of valuation inputs established by ASC Topic 820 are as follows: 
  Level 1 Inputs     include quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2 Inputs     include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
  Level 3 Inputs     include inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
  The Company s investment portfolio is comprised of debt and equity instruments of privately held companies for which quoted prices or other inputs falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 are not available. Therefore, the Company determines the fair value of its investments in good faith using Level 3 inputs, pursuant to a valuation policy and process that is established by the management of the Company with the assistance of certain third-party advisors and subsequently approved by the Company s Board of Directors. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith, as fair value depends upon the specific circumstances of each individual investment. The recorded fair values of the Company s investments may differ significantly from fair values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned. 
  
   22 

Triangle Capital Corporation 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

The Company s valuation process is led by the Company s executive officers. The Company s valuation process begins with a quarterly review of each investment in the Company s investment portfolio by the Company s executive officers and investment committee. Valuations of each portfolio security are then prepared by the Company s investment professionals, who have direct responsibility for the origination, management and monitoring of each investment. Under the Company s valuation policy, each investment valuation is subject to (i) a review by the lead investment officer responsible for the portfolio company investment and (ii) a peer review by a second investment officer or executive officer of the Company. Generally, any investment that is valued below cost is subjected to review by one of the Company s executive officers. After the peer review is complete, the Company engages two independent valuation firms, including Duff   Phelps, LLC (collectively, the  Valuation Firms ), to provide third-party reviews of certain investments, as described further below. Finally, the Board of Directors has the responsibility for reviewing and approving, in good faith, the fair value of the Company s investments in accordance with the 1940 Act. 
  The Valuation Firms provide third-party valuation consulting services to the Company which consist of certain procedures that the Company identified and requested the Valuation Firms to perform (hereinafter referred to as the  Procedures ). The Procedures are performed with respect to each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year and for new portfolio companies, at least once in the twelve-month period subsequent to the initial investment. In addition, the Procedures are generally performed with respect to a portfolio company when there has been a significant change in the fair value of the investment. In certain instances, the Company may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in the Company s stockholders  best interest, to request the Valuation Firms to perform the Procedures on one or more portfolio companies. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of the investment in the portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total investment portfolio.     
  The total number of investments and the percentage of the investment portfolio on which the Procedures were performed are summarized below by period:    

(1) 
    Exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter. 
     Upon completion of the Procedures, the Valuation Firms concluded that, with respect to each investment reviewed by each Valuation Firm, the fair value of those investments subjected to the Procedures appeared reasonable. The Company s Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for determining the fair value of the Company s investments in good faith. 
  Investment Valuation Inputs 
  Under ASC Topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller at the measurement date. For the Company s portfolio securities, fair value is generally the amount that the Company might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security. Under ASC Topic 820, the fair value measurement assumes that the sale occurs in the principal market for the security, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the security. Under ASC Topic 820, if no market for the security exists or if the Company does not have access to the principal market, the security should be valued based on the sale occurring in a hypothetical market. The securities in which the Company invests are generally only purchased and sold in merger and acquisition transactions, in which case the entire portfolio company is sold to a third-party purchaser. As a result, unless the Company has the ability to control such a transaction, the assumed principal market for the Company s securities is a hypothetical secondary market. The Level 3 inputs to the Company s valuation process reflect the Company s best estimate of the assumptions that would be used by market participants in pricing the investment in a transaction in a hypothetical secondary market.

Triangle Capital Corporation 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Enterprise Value Waterfall Approach 
  In valuing equity securities (including warrants), the Company estimates fair value using an  Enterprise Value Waterfall  valuation model. The Company estimates the enterprise value of a portfolio company and then allocates the enterprise value to the portfolio company s securities in order of their relative liquidation preference. In addition, the Company assumes that any outstanding debt or other securities that are senior to the Company s equity securities are required to be repaid at par. Additionally, the Company estimates the fair value of a limited number of its debt securities using the Enterprise Value Waterfall approach in cases where the Company does not expect to receive full repayment. 
  To estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the Company primarily uses a valuation model based on a transaction multiple, which generally is the original transaction multiple, and measures of the portfolio company s financial performance, which generally is either earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted ( Adjusted EBITDA ) or revenues. In addition, the Company considers other factors, including but not limited to (i) offers from third parties to purchase the portfolio company, (ii) the implied value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company, (iii) publicly available information regarding recent sales of private companies in comparable transactions and (iv) when the Company believes there are comparable companies that are publicly traded, the Company performs a review of these publicly traded companies and the market multiple of their equity securities. For certain non-performing assets, the Company may utilize the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company's assets in its estimation of enterprise value.  
  The significant Level 3 inputs to the Enterprise Value Waterfall model are (i) an appropriate transaction multiple and (ii) a measure of the portfolio company s financial performance, which generally is either Adjusted EBITDA or revenues. Such inputs can be based on historical operating results, projections of future operating results or a combination thereof. The operating results of a portfolio company may be unaudited, projected or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for certain non-recurring items. In determining the operating results input, the Company utilizes the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts available as of the valuation date. The Company also consults with the portfolio company s senior management to obtain updates on the portfolio company s performance, including information such as industry trends, new product development, loss of customers and other operational issues. Fair value measurements using the Enterprise Value Waterfall model can be sensitive to changes in one or more of the inputs. Assuming all other inputs to the Enterprise Value Waterfall model remain constant, any increase (decrease) in either the transaction multiple, Adjusted EBITDA or revenues for a particular equity security would result in a higher (lower) fair value for that security. 
  Income Approach 
  In valuing debt securities, the Company utilizes an  Income Approach  model that considers factors including, but not limited to, (i) the stated yield on the debt security, (ii) the portfolio company s current Adjusted EBITDA as compared to the portfolio company s historical or projected Adjusted EBITDA as of the date the investment was made and the portfolio company s anticipated Adjusted EBITDA for the next twelve months of operations, (iii) the portfolio company s current Leverage Ratio (defined as the portfolio company s total indebtedness divided by Adjusted EBITDA) as compared to its Leverage Ratio as of the date the investment was made, (iv) publicly available information regarding current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions of private companies and (v) when the Company believes a relevant comparison exists, current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions of publicly traded debt. In addition, the Company uses a risk rating system to estimate the probability of default on the debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default. This risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities held. 
  The Company considers the factors above, particularly any significant changes in the portfolio company s results of operations and leverage, and develops an expectation of the yield that a hypothetical market participant would require when purchasing the debt investment (the  Required Rate of Return ). The Required Rate of Return, along with the Leverage Ratio and Adjusted EBITDA, are the significant Level 3 inputs to the Income Approach model. For investments where the Leverage Ratio and Adjusted EBITDA have not fluctuated significantly from the date the investment was made or have not fluctuated significantly from the Company s expectations as of the date the investment was made, and where there have been no significant fluctuations in the market pricing for such investments, the Company may conclude that the Required Rate of Return is equal to the stated rate on the investment and therefore, the debt security is appropriately priced. In instances where the Company determines that the Required Rate of Return is different from the stated rate on the investment, the Company discounts the contractual cash flows on the debt instrument using the Required Rate of Return in order to estimate the fair value of the debt security.

Fair value measurements using the Income Approach model can be sensitive to changes in one or more of the inputs. Assuming all other inputs to the Income Approach model remain constant, any increase (decrease) in the Required Rate of Return or Leverage Ratio inputs for a particular debt security would result in a lower (higher) fair value for that security. Assuming all other inputs to the Income Approach model remain constant, any increase (decrease) in the Adjusted EBITDA input for a particular debt security would result in a higher (lower) fair value for that security. 
  The fair value of the Company s royalty rights are calculated based on specific provisions contained in the pertinent operating or royalty agreements. The determination of the fair value of such royalty rights is not a significant component of the Company s valuation process. 
  The ranges and weighted average values of the significant Level 3 inputs used in the valuation of the Company s debt and equity securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized as follows:  

(1) 
       Certain investments with a total fair value of $7,806,522 were repaid or redeemed subsequent to the end of the reporting period and were valued at their transaction price. 

(1) 
       Certain investments with a total fair value of $47,214,088 were repaid or redeemed subsequent to the end of the reporting period and were valued at their transaction price.

Pre-tax net unrealized losses on investments of   $11.1 million   and   $17.2 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, were related to portfolio company investments that were still held by the Company as of   September 30, 2016  . Pre-tax net unrealized gains (losses) on investments of $1.0 million and $(3.4) million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, were related to portfolio company investments that were still held by the Company as of September 30, 2015. 
  The Company s primary investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing directly in privately-held lower middle market companies to help these companies fund acquisitions, growth or refinancing. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company made investments of approximately $157.0 million in portfolio companies to which it was not previously contractually committed to provide such financing. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company made investments of $6.9 million in companies to which it was previously committed to provide such financing. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company made investments of approximately $348.3 million in portfolio companies to which it was not previously contractually committed to provide the financial support. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company made investments of $4.1 million in companies to which it was previously committed to provide such financing. The details of the Company s investments have been disclosed on the Consolidated Schedules of Investments. 
  Warrants 
  When originating a debt security, the Company will sometimes receive warrants or other equity-related securities from the borrower. The Company determines the cost basis of the warrants or other equity-related securities received based upon their respective fair values on the date of receipt in proportion to the total fair value of the debt and warrants or other equity-related securities received. Any resulting difference between the face amount of the debt and its recorded fair value resulting from the assignment of value to the warrant or other equity instruments is treated as original issue discount and accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. 
  Realized Gain or Loss and Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation of Portfolio Investments 
  Realized gains or losses are recorded upon the sale or liquidation of investments and are calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or liquidation, if any, and the cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the difference between the fair value of the investments and the cost basis of the investments.

Investment Classification 
  In accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Company classifies investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act,  Control Investments  are investments in those companies that the Company is deemed to  Control.   Affiliate Investments  are investments in those companies that are  Affiliated Companies  of the Company, as defined in the 1940 Act, other than Control Investments.  Non-Control / Non-Affiliate Investments  are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments. Generally, under the 1940 Act, the Company is deemed to control a company in which it has invested if the Company owns more than 25.0% of the voting securities of such company, has greater than 50.0% representation on its board or has the power to exercise control over management or policies of such portfolio company. The Company is deemed to be an affiliate of a company in which the Company has invested if it owns at least 5.0%, but no more than 25.0%, of the voting securities of such company. 
  Investment Income 
  Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of original issue discount, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if the Company otherwise does not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, the Company will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes, until all principal and interest has been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The Company writes off any previously accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that interest is no longer considered collectible. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. The Company had negative dividend income of $24,208 during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , consisting of dividend income of approximately $1.3 million and a negative true-up adjustment of approximately $1.3 million related to a portfolio company distribution that was received in 2015. In 2015, the Company received information that indicated that the tax character of the distribution was 100% dividend income, but received updated information in the first quarter of 2016 indicating that only 14% of the distribution was dividend income and the remainder was a return of capital, which necessitated the adjustment.  
  Fee Income 
  Origination, facility, commitment, consent and other advance fees received in connection with loan agreements ("Loan Origination Fees") are recorded as deferred income and recognized as investment income over the term of the loan. Upon prepayment of a loan, any unamortized Loan Origination Fees are recorded as investment income. In the general course of its business, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and loan waiver and amendment fees, and are recorded as investment income when earned. 
  Fee income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 was as follows:

  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

Payment-in-Kind Interest 
  The Company currently holds, and expects to hold in the future, some loans in its portfolio that contain PIK interest provisions. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is added to the principal balance of the loan, rather than being paid to the Company in cash, and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of PIK interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. 
  PIK interest, which is a non-cash source of income at the time of recognition, is included in the Company s taxable income and therefore affects the amount the Company is required to distribute to its stockholders to maintain its qualification as a regulated investment company ("RIC") for federal income tax purposes, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. Generally, when current cash interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if the Company otherwise does not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, the Company will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing PIK interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The Company writes off any accrued and uncollected PIK interest when it is determined that the PIK interest is no longer collectible. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  The Company s investments are generally in lower middle market companies in a variety of industries. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were no individual investments representing greater than 10% of the fair value of the Company s portfolio. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s largest single portfolio company investment represented approximately 5.0% and 4.0%, respectively, of the fair value of the Company s portfolio. Income, consisting of interest, dividends, fees, other investment income and realization of gains or losses on equity interests, can fluctuate dramatically upon repayment of an investment or sale of an equity interest and in any given year can be highly concentrated among several portfolio companies. 
  The Company s investments carry a number of risks including, but not limited to: (i) investing in lower middle market companies which may have limited financial resources and may have limited operating histories, (ii) investing in senior subordinated debt which ranks equal to or lower than debt held by other investors and (iii) holding investments that are not publicly traded and are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale and other risks common to investing in below investment grade debt and equity instruments. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , $746.2 million of the Company's assets were pledged as collateral for the Company's third amended and restated senior secured credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) and $381.5 million were subject to superior claim over the Company's shareholders by the SBA. If the Company defaults on its obligations under the Credit Facility or its SBA-guaranteed debentures, the lenders and/or the SBA may have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests or their superior claims. 
    
  Investments Denominated in Foreign Currency 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company held investments in two portfolio companies that were denominated in Canadian dollars and as of   December 31, 2015  , the Company held investments in one portfolio company that were denominated in Canadian dollars.  
  At each balance sheet date, portfolio company investments denominated in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using the spot exchange rate on the last business day of the period. Purchases and sales of foreign portfolio company investments, and any income from such investments, are translated into United States dollars using the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. 
  Although the fair values of foreign portfolio company investments and the fluctuation in such fair values are translated into United States dollars using the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, the Company does not isolate that portion of the change in fair values resulting from foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations from the change in fair values of the underlying investment. All fluctuations in fair value are included in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments in the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Investments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with those of domestic origin, including unanticipated movements in the value of the foreign currency relative to the United States dollar.

3. INCOME TAXES 
  The Company elected for federal income tax purposes to be treated as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2007. In order to maintain its qualification as a RIC, the Company must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then the Company is generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of its taxable income and gains it does not distribute (actually or constructively) and certain built-in gains. The Company has historically met its minimum distribution requirements and continually monitors its distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the Code. 
  The minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs require the Company to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income ( ICTI ), as defined by the Code, each year. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such excess. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI. 
  ICTI generally differs from net investment income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses. The Company may be required to recognize ICTI in certain circumstances in which it does not receive cash. For example, if the Company holds debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments issued with warrants), the Company must include in ICTI each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by the Company in the same taxable year. The Company may also have to include in ICTI other amounts that it has not yet received in cash, such as (i) PIK interest income and (ii) interest income from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in the Company s ICTI for the year of accrual, the Company may be required to make a distribution to its stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements, even though the Company will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. ICTI also excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized. 
  The Company has certain wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries (the  Taxable Subsidiaries ), each of which holds one or more of its portfolio investments that are listed on the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, such that the Company s consolidated financial statements reflect the Company s investments in the portfolio companies owned by the Taxable Subsidiaries. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiaries is to permit the Company to hold certain portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies ( LLCs ) (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90% of the RIC s gross revenue for income tax purposes must consist of investment income. Absent the Taxable Subsidiaries, a proportionate amount of any gross income of an LLC (or other pass-through entity) portfolio investment would flow through directly to the RIC. To the extent that such income did not consist of investment income, it could jeopardize the Company s ability to qualify as a RIC and therefore cause the Company to incur significant amounts of federal income taxes. When LLCs (or other pass-through entities) are owned by the Taxable Subsidiaries, their income is taxed to the Taxable Subsidiaries and does not flow through to the RIC, thereby helping the Company preserve its RIC status and resultant tax advantages. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. This income tax expense is reflected in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, any unrealized appreciation related to portfolio investments held by Taxable Subsidiaries (net of unrealized depreciation related to portfolio investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries) is reflected net of applicable federal and state income taxes in the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations, with the related deferred tax assets presented in the Company's Unaudited Balance Sheet. 
  For federal income tax purposes, the cost of investments owned as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was approximately   $991.8 million   and $1,010.6 million, respectively.

4. BORROWINGS 
  The Company had the following borrowings outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :    

SBA-Guaranteed Debentures 
  Interest payments on SBA-guaranteed debentures are payable semi-annually and there are no principal payments required on these debentures prior to maturity, nor do the debentures carry any prepayment penalties. The Company s SBA-guaranteed Low or Moderate Income ( LMI ) debenture, which was repaid on March 1, 2016, was a five-year deferred interest debenture that was issued at a discount to par. The accretion of discount on the SBA-guaranteed LMI debenture is classified as interest expense in the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  Under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 and current SBA policy applicable to SBICs, an SBIC (or group of SBICs under common control) can have outstanding at any time, SBA-guaranteed debentures and SBA-guaranteed LMI debentures (collectively, SBA-guaranteed debentures) up to two times (and in certain cases, up to three times) the amount of its regulatory capital. As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum statutory limit on the dollar amount of outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures that can be issued by a single SBIC was $150.0 million and by a group of SBICs under common control was $350.0 million. As of   September 30, 2016  , Triangle SBIC had issued the maximum $150.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures and Triangle SBIC II had issued $100.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures. The weighted average interest rates for all SBA-guaranteed debentures as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were 3.90% and 4.02%, respectively. In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repaid its $7.8 million SBA-guaranteed LMI debenture, which matured on March 1, 2016. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all SBA-guaranteed debentures were pooled.  
  In addition to a one-time 1.0% fee on the total commitment from the SBA, the Company also pays a one-time 2.425% fee on the amount of each SBA-guaranteed debenture issued and a one-time 2.0% fee on the amount of each SBA-guaranteed LMI debenture issued. These fees are capitalized as deferred financing costs and are amortized over the term of the debt agreements using the effective interest method. Upon prepayment of an SBA-guaranteed debenture, any unamortized deferred financing

Triangle Capital Corporation 
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 

costs related to the SBA-guaranteed debenture are written off and recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  The fair values of the SBA-guaranteed debentures are based on a market yield approach and current interest rates, which are Level 3 inputs to the market yield model. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amounts of the SBA-guaranteed debentures was approximately   $245.2 million   and $220.6 million, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of the SBA-guaranteed debentures were   $263.1 million   and $230.2 million, respectively.  
  Credit Facility 
  In May 2015, the Company entered into the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility, which has a current commitment of $300.0 million supported by 13 financial institutions, replaced the Company's $165.0 million senior secured credit facility entered into in June 2013 (the "Prior Facility"). The revolving period of the Credit Facility ends May 3, 2019 followed by a one-year amortization period with a final maturity date of May 3, 2020. The Company has the ability to borrow foreign currencies under the Credit Facility.  
  The Credit Facility has an accordion feature that allows for an increase in the total borrowing size up to $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions and the satisfaction of specified financial covenants. The Credit Facility, which is structured to operate like a revolving credit facility, is secured primarily by the Company's assets, excluding the assets of the Company s wholly-owned SBIC subsidiaries.  
  Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, subject to the Company's election, on a per annum basis equal to (i) the applicable base rate plus 1.75% (or 1.50% if the Company receives an investment grade credit rating), (ii) the applicable LIBOR rate plus 2.75% (or 2.50% if the Company receives an investment grade credit rating) or (iii) for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, the applicable Canadian Dealer Offered Rate plus 2.75% (or 2.50% if the Company receives an investment grade credit rating). The applicable base rate is equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the adjusted one-month LIBOR plus 2.0%. The applicable LIBOR rate depends on the term of the draw under the Credit Facility. The Company pays a commitment fee of 1.00% per annum on undrawn amounts if the used portion of the Credit Facility is less than or equal to 25.0% of total commitments, or 0.375% per annum on undrawn amounts if the used portion of the Credit Facility is greater than 25.0% of total commitments. These commitment fees are included in interest and other financing fees on the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are limited to a borrowing base, which includes certain cash and a portion of eligible debt investments. 
  Borrowings under the Prior Facility bore interest, subject to the Company's election, on a per annum basis equal to (i) the applicable base rate plus 1.75%, (ii) the applicable LIBOR rate plus 2.75% or (iii) for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, the applicable Canadian Dealer Offered Rate plus 2.75%. The applicable base rate was equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the adjusted one-month LIBOR rate plus 2.0%. The applicable LIBOR rate depended upon the term of a draw under the Prior Facility. The Company paid a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum on undrawn amounts under the Prior Facility, which was included with interest and other financing fees on the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. Borrowings under the Prior Facility were also limited to a borrowing base, which included certain cash and a portion of eligible debt investments.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had United States dollar borrowings of $69.7 million outstanding under the Credit Facility with an interest rate of 3.28% and non-United States dollar borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars of $28.6 million ($21.7 million in United States dollars) outstanding under the Credit Facility with a weighted average interest rate of 3.65%. The borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars are translated into United States dollars based on the spot rate at each balance sheet date. The impact resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on the Credit Facility borrowings is included in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency borrowings in the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. The borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may be positively or negatively affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the United States dollar and the Canadian dollar. This movement is beyond the control of the Company and cannot be predicted. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had United States dollar borrowings of $119.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility with an interest rate of 3.00% and non-United States dollar borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars of $17.0 million ($12.3 million United States dollars) outstanding under the Credit Facility with an interest rate of 3.59%.  
  The fair value of the borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility are based on a market yield approach and current interest rates, which are Level 3 inputs to the market yield model. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of the borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility were   $91.4 million   and $131.3 million, respectively.

As with the Prior Facility, the Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to (i) maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio, (ii) maintaining a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, (iii) maintaining a minimum asset coverage ratio and (iv) maintaining the Company's status as a RIC and as a BDC. The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default with customary cure and notice provisions, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenant, cross-default to other indebtedness, bankruptcy, change of control, and material adverse effect. The Credit Facility also permits Branch Banking and Trust Company, the administrative agent, to select an independent third-party valuation firm to determine valuations of certain portfolio investments for purposes of borrowing base provisions. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility. 
  Notes    
  In March 2012, the Company issued $69.0 million of unsecured notes due 2019 (the  2019 Notes ). The 2019 Notes were redeemed in full on June 22, 2015 for a total redemption price of $69.0 million, which resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million. Prior to the redemption, the 2019 Notes bore interest at a rate of 7.00% per year payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2012. 
  In October 2012, the Company issued $70.0 million of unsecured notes due 2022 (the "December 2022 Notes") and in November 2012, issued $10.5 million of December 2022 Notes pursuant to the exercise of an over-allotment option. The December 2022 Notes mature on December 15, 2022, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after December 15, 2015. The December 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per year payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2012. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the December 2022 Notes, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $77.8 million. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of the December 2022 Notes was   $78.6 million   and $78.4 million, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the December 2022 Notes was   $83.2 million   and $80.2 million, respectively.  
  In February 2015, the Company issued $86.3 million of unsecured notes due 2022 (the "March 2022 Notes"). The March 2022 Notes mature on March 15, 2022 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after March 15, 2018. The March 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per year payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2015. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the March 2022 Notes, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $83.4 million. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of the March 2022 Notes was   $84.0 million   and $83.7 million, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the March 2022 Notes was   $89.7 million   and $88.0 million, respectively. The fair values of the December 2022 Notes and the March 2022 Notes are based on the closing prices of each respective security on the New York Stock Exchange, which are Level 1 inputs under ASC 820. 
  The indenture and supplements thereto relating to the December 2022 Notes and the March 2022 Notes contain certain covenants, including but not limited to (i) a requirement that the Company comply with the asset coverage requirement of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions and (ii) a requirement to provide financial information to the holders of the notes and the trustee under the indenture if the Company should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the December 2022 Notes and the March 2022 Notes.

5. EQUITY-BASED AND OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS 
  The Company s Board of Directors and stockholders have approved the Triangle Capital Corporation Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), under which there are 2,400,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock authorized for issuance. Under the Plan, the Board of Directors (or compensation committee, if delegated administrative authority by the Board of Directors) may award stock options, restricted stock or other stock-based incentive awards to executive officers, employees and directors. Equity-based awards granted under the Plan to independent directors generally will vest over a one-year period and equity-based awards granted under the Plan to executive officers and employees generally will vest ratably over a four-year period. 
  The Company accounts for its equity-based compensation plan using the fair value method, as prescribed by ASC Topic 718,   Stock Compensation  . Accordingly, for restricted stock awards, the Company measures the grant date fair value based upon the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant and amortizes this fair value to compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period or vesting term. 
  The following table presents information with respect to the Plan for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

In the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized equity-based compensation expense of approximately   $1.6 million  . In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized equity-based compensation expense of approximately   $7.5 million  , $2.7 million of which related to the accelerated vesting of outstanding shares of restricted stock of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, Garland S. Tucker III, who retired from his officer positions in February 2016. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized equity-based compensation expense of approximately $1.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively. This expense is included in compensation expenses in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $11.5 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company s non-vested restricted shares. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   1.9   years. 
  The Company s Board of Directors has adopted a nonqualified deferred compensation plan covering the Company s executive officers and key employees. Any compensation deferred and the Company s contributions will earn a return based on the returns on certain investments designated by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. Participants are 100% vested in amounts deferred under the deferred compensation plan and the earnings thereon. Contributions to the plan and earnings thereon generally vest ratably over a four-year period. 
  The Company maintains a 401(k) plan in which all full-time employees who are at least 21 years of age are eligible to participate and receive employer contributions. Eligible employees may contribute a portion of their compensation on a pretax basis into the 401(k) plan up to the maximum amount allowed under the Code, and direct the investment of their contributions.

Readers are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report are only predictions, are not guarantees of future performance, and are subject to risks, events, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Our actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors discussed herein and in Item 1A entitled  Risk Factors  in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless we are required to do so by law. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. 
  Overview of Our Business 
  We are a Maryland corporation which has elected to be treated and operates as an internally managed business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Triangle Mezzanine Fund LLLP, or Triangle SBIC, and Triangle Mezzanine Fund II LP, or Triangle SBIC II, are licensed as small business investment companies, or SBICs, by the United States Small Business Administration, or SBA. In addition, Triangle SBIC has also elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We, Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II invest primarily in debt instruments, equity investments, warrants and other securities of lower middle market privately-held companies located primarily in the United States. 
  Our business is to provide capital to lower middle market companies located primarily in the United States. We focus on investments in companies with a history of generating revenues and positive cash flows, an established market position and a proven management team with a strong operating discipline. Our target portfolio company has annual revenues between $20.0 million and $200.0 million and annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, between $3.0 million and $35.0 million. 
  We invest primarily in subordinated debt securities secured by second lien security interests in portfolio company assets, coupled with equity interests. On a more limited basis, we also invest in senior debt securities secured by first lien security interests in portfolio company assets. Our investments generally range from $5.0 million to $35.0 million per portfolio company. In certain situations, we have partnered with other funds to provide larger financing commitments. 
  We generate revenues in the form of interest income, primarily from our investments in debt securities, loan origination and other fees and dividend income. Fees generated in connection with our debt investments are recognized over the life of the loan using the effective interest method or, in some cases, recognized as earned. In addition, we generate revenue in the form of  
  
   45 

capital gains, if any, on warrants or other equity-related securities that we acquire from our portfolio companies. Our debt investments generally have a term of between three and seven years and typically bear interest at fixed rates between 10.0% and 15.0% per annum. Certain of our debt investments have a form of interest, referred to as payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest, that is not paid currently but is instead accrued and added to the loan balance and paid at the end of the term. In our negotiations with potential portfolio companies, we generally seek to minimize PIK interest. Cash interest on our debt investments is generally payable monthly; however, some of our debt investments pay cash interest on a quarterly basis. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the weighted average yield on our outstanding debt investments other than non-accrual debt investments was approximately   12.3%   and 12.2%, respectively. The weighted average yield on all of our outstanding investments (including equity and equity-linked investments but excluding non-accrual debt investments) was approximately   10.5%   and 10.6% as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The weighted average yield on all of our outstanding investments (including equity and equity-linked investments and non-accrual debt investments) was approximately   10.0%   and 10.2% as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II are eligible to issue debentures to the SBA, which pools these with debentures of other SBICs and sells them in the capital markets at favorable interest rates, in part as a result of the guarantee of payment from the SBA. Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II invest these funds in portfolio companies. We intend to continue to operate Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II as SBICs, subject to SBA approval, and to utilize the proceeds from the issuance of SBA-guaranteed debentures, referred to herein as SBA leverage, to enhance returns to our stockholders. 
  Portfolio Investment Composition 
  The total value of our investment portfolio was   $947.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to $977.3 million as of   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had investments in 86 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of   $987.3 million  . As of   December 31, 2015  , we had investments in 92 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of $1.0 billion. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , none of our portfolio investments represented greater than 10% of the total fair value of our investment portfolio. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our investment portfolio consisted of the following investments:

We had ten portfolio company loans repaid at par totaling $137.4 million resulting in realized gains totaling $0.7 million and received normal principal repayments and partial loan prepayments totaling $24.0 million in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . We converted subordinated debt investments in one portfolio company into an equity investment and recognized a realized loss on such conversion totaling $1.6 million. We wrote off an equity investment in one portfolio company and recognized a realized loss on the write-off of $2.0 million and wrote off a debt investment in one portfolio company and recognized a realized loss on the write-off of $16.1 million. In addition, we received proceeds related to  
  
   46

In addition, we received proceeds related to the sales of certain equity securities totaling $14.6 million and recognized net realized gains on such sales totaling $7.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

(1) 
    Excludes non-accrual debt investments 

47 

(1) 
    Excludes non-accrual debt investments 
     Non-Accrual Assets 
  Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our non-accrual assets was   $19.5 million  , which comprised   2.1%   of the total fair value of our portfolio, and the cost of our non-accrual assets was   $38.1 million  , which comprised   3.9%   of the total cost of our portfolio. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our non-accrual assets was $6.9 million, which comprised 0.7% of the total fair value of our portfolio, and the cost of our non-accrual assets was $20.4 million, which comprised 2.0% of the total cost of our portfolio.

This Tranche III subordinated debt investment bears interest at a rate of 0% Cash and 19% PIK.

Results of Operations 
  Comparison of   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    
  Investment Income 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , total investment income was   $27.4 million  , a   11.1%   decrease from   $30.8 million   of total investment income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.8 million decrease in non-recurring fee income, a $0.8 million decrease in investment income related to non-accrual assets, a $0.1 million decrease in non-recurring dividend income and a decrease in the weighted average yield on our debt investments from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . Non-recurring fee income was $1.2 million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to $3.0 million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . Non-recurring dividend income was $0.3 million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to $0.5 million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  Operating Expenses 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , operating expenses decreased by   6.0%   to   $11.6 million   from   $12.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . Our operating expenses consist of interest and other financing fees, compensation expenses and general and administrative expenses.  
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , interest and other financing fees increased by   3.0%   to   $6.8 million   from   $6.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in interest and other financing fees was related primarily to the interest and fee amortization of $0.2 million on the incremental $25.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our SBA-guaranteed debentures. 
  Compensation expenses are primarily influenced by headcount and levels of business activity. Our compensation expenses include salaries, discretionary compensation, equity-based compensation and benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by our level of total investment income, our investment results including investment realizations, prevailing labor markets and the external environment. As a result of these and other factors, our compensation expenses can fluctuate materially from period to period. Accordingly, the amount of compensation expenses recognized in any particular period may not be indicative of compensation expenses in a future period. 
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compensation expenses decreased by   19.9%   to   $4.0 million   from   $5.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease in compensation expenses was primarily related to decreased discretionary compensation expenses. 
  
   49 

For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , general and administrative expenses increased by   5.7%   to   $0.9 million   from   $0.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  In addition, our efficiency ratio (defined as the sum of compensation expenses and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total investment income) decreased to   17.6%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   18.7%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Net Investment Income 
  As a result of the   $3.4 million   decrease in total investment income and the   $0.7 million   decrease in operating expenses, net investment income decreased by   14.5%   to   $15.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   $18.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Net Increase/Decrease in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
  In the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized realized losses totaling   $11.2 million  , which consisted primarily of a net loss on the write-off of one non-control/non-affiliate investment totaling $16.1 million, partially offset by net gains on the sales of   four   non-control/non-affiliate investments totaling   $4.9 million  . In addition, during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded net unrealized appreciation totaling   $3.2 million  , consisting of net unrealized depreciation on our current portfolio of $9.0 million and net unrealized appreciation reclassification adjustments of $12.2 million related to the realized gains and losses noted above. 
  In the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized realized losses totaling $16.5 million, which consisted of a loss on the write-off of one control investment totaling $18.3 million and a loss on the write-off of one affiliate investment totaling $0.5 million, partially offset by gains related to the sales/repayments of six non-control/non-affiliate investments totaling $2.3 million. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded net unrealized appreciation totaling $15.5 million, consisting of net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of $0.2 million and net unrealized appreciation reclassification adjustments of $15.3 million related to the realized gains and losses noted above. 
  As a result of these events, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was   $7.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of   $17.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Comparison of   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    
  Investment Income 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , total investment income was   $82.5 million  , a   7.8%   decrease from   $89.4 million   of total investment income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily attributable to a $3.4 million decrease in non-recurring fee income and a $2.7 million decrease in non-recurring dividend income, a $0.4 million decrease in investment income related to non-accrual assets and a decrease in the weighted average yield on our debt investments from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . Non-recurring fee income was $4.5 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to $7.9 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net non-recurring dividend income was $(0.3) million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to $2.4 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our net negative non-recurring dividend income during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of non-recurring dividend income of approximately $0.9 million and a negative true-up adjustment of $1.3 million related to a portfolio company distribution that was received in 2015. In 2015, we received information that indicated that the tax character of the distribution was 100% dividend income, but received updated information in 2016 indicating that only 14% of the distribution was dividend income and the remainder was a return of capital, which necessitated the adjustment. 
  Operating Expenses 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , operating expenses increased by   10.1%   to   $40.7 million   from   $37.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our operating expenses consist of interest and other financing fees, compensation expenses and general and administrative expenses.  
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , interest and other financing fees decreased by   1.4%   to   $20.0 million   from   $20.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in interest and other financing fees was related to $2.4 million of interest savings related to the redemption of our unsecured notes due in March 2019, or the 2019 Notes, partially offset by an increase in interest and other financing fees of $0.2 million on the $25.0 million of incremental outstanding borrowings under our SBA-guaranteed debentures, an increase in interest and other financing fees of $1.4 million  
  
   50 

related to increased borrowings under our third amended and restated senior secured credit facility, or the Credit Facility, and an increase of $0.5 million in interest and other financing fees from the February 2015 issuance of our unsecured notes due in March 2022, or the March 2022 Notes. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compensation expenses increased by   26.2%   to   $17.5 million   from   $13.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in compensation expenses in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily related to one-time expenses associated with the retirement of our former Chief Executive Officer, Garland S. Tucker, III, from his officer positions in February 2016. Our Board of Directors awarded Mr. Tucker a $2.5 million cash bonus and accelerated the   v  esting of his outstanding shares of restricted stock, including 47,000 shares of restricted stock awarded to him in February 2016 based on his performance during 2015, and certain other compensation in connection with his retirement and in recognition of his long service. We recognized $5.5 million in one-time compensation expenses in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   associated with Mr. Tucker's retirement. This increase was partially offset by decreased discretionary compensation expenses. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , general and administrative expenses increased by   13.3%   to   $3.2 million   from   $2.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  In addition, our efficiency ratio (defined as the sum of compensation expenses and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total investment income) increased to   25.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   18.6%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Net Investment Income 
  As a result of the   $7.0 million   decrease in total investment income and the   $3.7 million   increase in operating expenses, net investment income decreased by   20.4%   to   $41.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $52.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Net Increase/Decrease in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized realized losses totaling   $6.7 million  , which consisted primarily of net losses on the the write-off/sales of four affiliate investments totaling $1.7 million, a loss on the restructuring of   one   non-control/non-affiliate investment totaling $1.6 million and a loss on the write-off of one non-control/non-affiliate investment totaling $16.1 million, partially off-set by net gains on the sales/repayments of fourteen non-control/non-affiliate investments totaling $12.7 million. In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net unrealized depreciation totaling   $8.1 million  , consisting of net unrealized depreciation on our current portfolio of   $15.7 million   and net unrealized appreciation reclassification adjustments of   $7.5 million   related to the realized gains and losses noted above. 
  In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized realized losses totaling $30.3 million, which consisted of a loss on the restructuring of one control investment totaling $20.5 million, a loss on the write-off of one control investment totaling $18.3 million and a loss on the write- off of one affiliate investment totaling $0.5 million, partially offset by net gains related to the sale/repayments of four affiliate investments of $0.3 million and net gains on the sales/repayments of thirteen non- control/non- affiliate investments totaling $8.7 million. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded net unrealized appreciation of investments totaling $17.4 million, consisting of net unrealized depreciation on our current portfolio of approximately $12.3 million and net unrealized appreciation reclassification adjustments of $29.6 million related to the realized gains and losses noted above. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.4 million related to the redemption of the 2019 Notes. 
  As a result of these events, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was   $27.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of   $38.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our available leverage under the Credit Facility, and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations for at least the next twelve months. 
  In the future, depending on the valuation of Triangle SBIC s assets and Triangle SBIC II s assets pursuant to SBA guidelines, Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II may be limited by provisions of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, or the Small Business Investment Act, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to Triangle Capital Corporation that may be necessary to enable Triangle Capital Corporation to make the minimum required distributions to its stockholders and qualify as a RIC. 
  Cash Flows 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of   $115.7 million  . During that period, our operating activities provided   $55.8 million   in cash, consisting primarily of repayments received from portfolio companies and proceeds from sales of portfolio investments of approximately   $182.2 million  , partially offset by new portfolio investments of   $163.9 million  . In addition, our financing activities increased cash by   $60.0 million  , consisting primarily of proceeds from the public stock offering of   $129.1 million   and borrowings under SBA-guaranteed debentures of   $32.8 million  , partially offset by cash dividends paid in the amount of   $49.1 million  , net repayments under the Credit Facility of $40.4 million and the repayment of the SBA-guaranteed LMI debenture of   $7.8 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $168.3 million   of cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $25.7 million. During that period, our operating activities used $38.4 million in cash, consisting primarily of new portfolio investments of $352.4 million, partially offset by repayments received from portfolio companies and proceeds from sales of portfolio investments of approximately $261.0 million. In addition, our financing activities increased cash by $12.8 million, primarily due to net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $60.0 million and proceeds from the March 2022 Notes offering of $83.4 million, partially offset by redemption of the 2019 Notes of $69.0 million and cash dividends paid in the amount of $56.1 million. As of September 30, 2015, we had $53.0 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
  Financing Transactions 
  Due to Triangle SBIC s and Triangle SBIC II s status as licensed SBICs, Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II have the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the SBA at favorable interest rates. Under the Small Business Investment Act and the SBA rules applicable to SBICs, an SBIC (or group of SBICs under common control) can have outstanding at any time debentures guaranteed by the SBA up to two times (and in certain cases, up to three times) the amount of its regulatory capital, which generally is the amount raised from private investors. The maximum statutory limit on the dollar amount of outstanding debentures guaranteed by the SBA issued by a single SBIC is currently $150.0 million and by a group of SBICs under common control is $350.0 million. Debentures guaranteed by the SBA have a maturity of ten years, with interest payable semi-annually. The principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be prepaid at any time, without penalty. As a result of its guarantee of our SBA-guaranteed debentures, the SBA has fixed-dollar claims on the assets of Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II that are superior to the claims of our security holders. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Triangle SBIC had issued the maximum $150.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures and Triangle SBIC II had issued $100.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures. In addition to the one-time 1.0% fee on the total commitment from the SBA, we also pay a one-time 2.425% fee on the amount of each debenture issued (2.0% for SBA LMI debentures). These fees are capitalized as deferred financing costs and are amortized over the term of the debt agreements using the effective interest method. The weighted average interest rate for all SBA-guaranteed debentures as of   September 30, 2016   was 3.90%. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repaid the $7.8 million SBA-guaranteed LMI debenture, which matured on March 1, 2016. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all SBA-guaranteed debentures were pooled.  
  In May 2015, we entered the Credit Facility, which has a current commitment of $300.0 million supported by 13 financial institutions and replaced our $165.0 million senior secured credit facility entered into in June 2013, or the Prior Facility. The revolving period of the Credit Facility ends May 3, 2019 followed by a one-year amortization period with a final maturity date of May 3, 2020. We have the ability to borrow in both United States dollars as well as foreign currencies under the Credit Facility.  
  The Credit Facility has an accordion feature that allows for an increase in the total borrowing size up to $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions and the satisfaction of specified financial covenants. The Credit Facility, which is structured to  
  
   52 

operate like a revolving credit facility, is secured primarily by our assets, excluding the assets of our wholly-owned SBIC subsidiaries.  
  Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, subject to our election, on a per annum basis equal to (i) the applicable base rate plus 1.75% (or 1.50% if we receive an investment grade credit rating), (ii) the applicable LIBOR rate plus 2.75% (or 2.50% if we receive an investment grade credit rating) or (iii) for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, the applicable Canadian Dealer Offered Rate plus 2.75% (or 2.50% if we receive an investment grade credit rating). The applicable base rate is equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the adjusted one-month LIBOR plus 2.0%. The applicable LIBOR rate depends on the term of the draw under the Credit Facility. We pay a commitment fee of 1.00% per annum on undrawn amounts if the used portion of the Credit Facility is less than or equal to 25.0% of total commitments, or 0.375% per annum on undrawn amounts if the used portion of the Credit Facility is greater than 25.0% of total commitments.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had United States dollar borrowings of $69.7 million outstanding under the Credit Facility with an interest rate of 3.28% and non-United States dollar borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars of $28.6 million ($21.7 million in United States dollars) outstanding under the Credit Facility with a weighted average interest rate of 3.65%. The borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars are translated into United States dollars based on the spot rate at each balance sheet date. The impact resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on the Credit Facility borrowings is included in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency borrowings in our Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. The borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may be positively or negatively affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the United States dollar and the Canadian dollar. This movement is beyond our control and cannot be predicted.  
  As with the Prior Facility, the Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to (i) maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio, (ii) maintaining a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, (iii) maintaining a minimum asset coverage ratio and (iv) maintaining our status as a regulated investment company, or RIC, and as a BDC. The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default with customary cure and notice provisions, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenant, cross-default to other indebtedness, bankruptcy, change of control, and material adverse effect. The Credit Facility also permits Branch Banking and Trust Company, the administrative agent, to select an independent third-party valuation firm to determine valuations of certain portfolio investments for purposes of borrowing base provisions. In connection with the Credit Facility, we also entered into new collateral documents. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility. 
  In March 2012, we issued $69.0 million of 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes were redeemed in full on June 22, 2015 for a total redemption price of $69.0 million, which resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million. Prior to the redemptions, the 2019 Notes bore interest at a rate of 7.00% per year payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2012.  
  In October 2012, we issued $70.0 million of unsecured notes due December 2022, or the December 2022 Notes, and in November 2012, we issued $10.5 million of December 2022 Notes pursuant to the exercise of an over-allotment option. The December 2022 Notes mature on December 15, 2022, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 15, 2015. The December 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per year payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2012. The net proceeds from the sale of the December 2022 Notes, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $77.8 million.  
  In February 2015, we issued $86.3 million of March 2022 Notes. The March 2022 Notes mature on March 15, 2022 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after March 15, 2018. The March 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per year payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2015. The net proceeds from the sale of the March 2022 Notes, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $83.4 million.  
  The indenture and related supplements thereto relating to the December 2022 Notes and the March 2022 Notes contain certain covenants, including but not limited to (i) a requirement that we comply with the asset coverage requirement of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC, (ii) a requirement that we will not declare any cash dividend, or declare any other cash distribution, upon a class of our capital stock, or purchase any such capital stock, unless, in every such case, at the time of the declaration of any such dividend or distribution, or at the time of any such purchase, we have an asset coverage (as defined in the 1940 Act) of at least 200% after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC, and (iii) a requirement that we provide financial information to the holders of the notes and the trustee under the  
  
   53 

indenture if we should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants of the December 2022 Notes and the March 2022 Notes. 
  Distributions to Stockholders 
  We elected to be treated as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In order to maintain our qualification as a RIC and to obtain RIC tax benefits, we must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then we are generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income and gains we do not distribute (actually or constructively) and certain built-in gains. We have historically met our minimum distribution requirements and continually monitor our distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the Code. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and our ability to make distributions will be limited by the asset coverage requirement and related provisions under the 1940 Act and contained in the indenture and related supplements governing the December 2022 Notes and the March 2022 Notes. 
  The minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs require us to distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, or ICTI, as defined by the Code. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such excess. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of the next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI. 
  ICTI generally differs from net investment income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses. We may be required to recognize ICTI in certain circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments issued with warrants), we must include in ICTI each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in ICTI other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as (i) PIK interest income and (ii) interest income from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our ICTI for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements, even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. ICTI also excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized. 
  Recent Developments 
  In October 2016, we invested $23.5 million in debt and equity securities of Fridababy, LLC. Under the terms of the investments, the debt securities bear interest at a rate of 10.0%. 
  In October 2016, we invested $17.0 million in debt and equity securities of Del Real, LLC. Under the terms of the investments, the debt securities bear interest at a rate of 11.0%.  
  In October 2016, we invested $16.3 million in debt and equity securities of TG MIDCO, LLC.  Under the terms of the investments, the debt securities bear interest at a rate of 11.25%.  
  In October 2016, our Board of Directors approved the promotion of Jeffrey A. Dombcik, Cary B. Nordan and Douglas A. Vaughn to the role of Senior Managing Director. In addition, Messrs. Dombcik, Nordan and Vaughn were promoted to the positions of Chief Credit Officer, Chief Origination Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, respectively. 
    
  In October 2016, our Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Brent P.W. Burgess as our Chief Investment Officer and as a member of our Board of Directors. In connection with Mr. Burgess s resignations, we and Mr. Burgess entered into an agreement (the  Agreement ), pursuant to which he will receive his unpaid salary and accrued but unused vacation leave through October 14, 2016; cash payments totaling $250,000; accelerated vesting of the 93,284 shares of our restricted stock held by him; and certain other benefits. Mr. Burgess also agreed to certain confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and other covenants in the Agreement. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of our unaudited financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  
  
   54 

and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by such financial statements. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. 
  Investment Valuation 
  The most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. We have established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring (quarterly) basis in accordance with the 1940 Act and FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   or ASC Topic 820. Under ASC Topic 820, a financial instrument is categorized within the ASC Topic 820 valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input to the valuation process that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of valuation inputs established by ASC Topic 820 are as follows: 
  Level 1 Inputs     include quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2 Inputs     include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
  Level 3 Inputs     include inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
  Our investment portfolio is comprised of debt and equity instruments of privately held companies for which quoted prices or other inputs falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 are not available. Therefore, we determine the fair value of our investments in good faith using Level 3 inputs, pursuant to a valuation policy and process that is established by our management with the assistance of certain third-party advisors and subsequently approved by our Board of Directors. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith, as fair value depends upon the specific circumstances of each individual investment. The recorded fair values of our investments may differ significantly from fair values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned. 
  Our valuation process is led by our executive officers. The valuation process begins with a quarterly review of each investment in our investment portfolio by our executive officers and our investment committee. Valuations of each portfolio security are then prepared by our investment professionals, who have direct responsibility for the origination, management and monitoring of each investment. Under our valuation policy, each investment valuation is subject to (i) a review by the lead investment officer responsible for the portfolio company investment and (ii) a peer review by a second investment officer or executive officer. Generally, any investment that is valued below cost is subjected to review by one of our executive officers. After the peer review is complete, we engage two independent valuation firms, including Duff   Phelps, LLC, collectively, the "Valuation Firms," to provide third-party reviews of certain investments, as described further below. Finally, the Board of Directors has the responsibility for reviewing and approving, in good faith, the fair value of our investments in accordance with the 1940 Act. 
  The Valuation Firms provide third-party valuation consulting services to us which consist of certain limited procedures that we identified and requested the Valuation Firms to perform, which we refer to herein as the Procedures. The Procedures are performed with respect to each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year and for new portfolio companies, at least once in the twelve-month period subsequent to the initial investment. In addition, the Procedures are generally performed with respect to a portfolio company when there has been a significant change in the fair value of the investment. In certain instances, we may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in our stockholders  best interest, to request the Valuation Firms to perform the Procedures on one or more portfolio companies. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of the investment in the portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total investment portfolio. 
  
   55 

The total number of investments and the percentage of our investment portfolio on which the Procedures were performed are summarized below by period:   

           (1) 
    Exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter. 
     Upon completion of the Procedures, the Valuation Firms concluded that, with respect to each investment reviewed by each Valuation Firm, the fair value of those investments subjected to the Procedures appeared reasonable. Our Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for determining the fair value of our investments in good faith. 
  Investment Valuation Inputs 
  Under ASC Topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller at the measurement date. For our portfolio securities, fair value is generally the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security. Under ASC Topic 820, the fair value measurement assumes that the sale occurs in the principal market for the security, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the security. Under ASC Topic 820, if no market for the security exists or if we do not have access to the principal market, the security should be valued based on the sale occurring in a hypothetical market. The securities in which we invest are generally only purchased and sold in merger and acquisition transactions, in which case the entire portfolio company is sold to a third-party purchaser. As a result, unless we have the ability to control such a transaction, the assumed principal market for our securities is a hypothetical secondary market. The Level 3 inputs to our valuation process reflect management s best estimate of the assumptions that would be used by market participants in pricing the investment in a transaction in a hypothetical secondary market. 
  Enterprise Value Waterfall Approach 
  In valuing equity securities (including warrants), we estimate fair value using an  Enterprise Value Waterfall  valuation model. We estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company and then allocate the enterprise value to the portfolio company s securities in order of their relative liquidation preference. In addition, the model assumes that any outstanding debt or other securities that are senior to our equity securities are required to be repaid at par. Additionally, we estimate the fair value of a limited number of our debt securities using the Enterprise Value Waterfall approach in cases where we do not expect to receive full repayment. 
  To estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company, we primarily use a valuation model based on a transaction multiple, which generally is the original transaction multiple, and measures of the portfolio company s financial performance, which generally is either earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted, or Adjusted EBITDA, or revenues. In addition, we consider other factors, including but not limited to (i) offers from third parties to purchase the portfolio company, (ii) the implied value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company, (iii) publicly available information regarding recent sales of private companies in comparable transactions and (iv) when management believes there are comparable companies that are publicly traded, we perform a review of these publicly traded companies and the market multiple of their equity securities. For certain non-performing assets, we may utilize the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company's assets in our estimation of enterprise value. 
  The significant Level 3 inputs to the Enterprise Value Waterfall model are (i) an appropriate transaction multiple and (ii) a measure of the portfolio company s financial performance, which generally is either Adjusted EBITDA or revenues. Such inputs can be based on historical operating results, projections of future operating results or a combination thereof. The operating results of a portfolio company may be unaudited, projected or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for certain non-recurring items. In determining the operating results input, we utilize the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts available as of the valuation date. Management also consults with the portfolio company s senior management to obtain updates on the portfolio company s performance, including information such as  
  
   56 

industry trends, new product development, loss of customers and other operational issues. Additionally, we consider some or all of the following factors: 
             
    financial standing of the issuer of the security; 
                
    comparison of the business and financial plan of the issuer with actual results; 
                
    the size of the security held; 
                
    pending reorganization activity affecting the issuer, such as merger or debt restructuring; 
                
    ability of the issuer to obtain needed financing; 
                
    changes in the economy affecting the issuer; 
                
    financial statements and reports from portfolio company senior management and ownership; 
                
    the type of security, the security s cost at the date of purchase and any contractual restrictions on the disposition of the security; 
                
    information as to any transactions or offers with respect to the security and/or sales to third parties of similar securities; 
                
    the issuer s ability to make payments and the type of collateral; 
                
    the current and forecasted earnings of the issuer; 
                
    statistical ratios compared to lending standards and to other similar securities;  
                
    pending public offering of common stock by the issuer of the security;  
                
    special reports prepared by analysts; and 
                
    any other factors we deem pertinent with respect to a particular investment. 
     Fair value measurements using the Enterprise Value Waterfall model can be sensitive to changes in one or more of the inputs. Assuming all other inputs to the Enterprise Value Waterfall model remain constant, any increase (decrease) in either the transaction multiple, Adjusted EBITDA or revenues for a particular equity security would result in a higher (lower) fair value for that security. 
  Income Approach 
  In valuing debt securities, we utilize an  Income Approach  model that considers factors including, but not limited to, (i) the stated yield on the debt security, (ii) the portfolio company s current Adjusted EBITDA as compared to the portfolio company s historical or projected Adjusted EBITDA as of the date the investment was made and the portfolio company s anticipated Adjusted EBITDA for the next twelve months of operations, (iii) the portfolio company s current Leverage Ratio (defined as the portfolio company s total indebtedness divided by Adjusted EBITDA) as compared to its Leverage Ratio as of the date the investment was made, (iv) publicly available information regarding current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions of private companies and (v) when management believes a relevant comparison exists, current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions of publicly traded debt. In addition, we use a risk rating system to estimate the probability of default on the debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default. This risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities held. 
  We consider the factors above, particularly any significant changes in the portfolio company s results of operations and leverage, and develop an expectation of the yield that a hypothetical market participant would require when purchasing the debt investment, which we refer to herein as the Required Rate of Return. The Required Rate of Return, along with the Leverage Ratio and Adjusted EBITDA, are the significant Level 3 inputs to the Income Approach model. For investments where the Leverage Ratio and Adjusted EBITDA have not fluctuated significantly from the date the investment was made or have not fluctuated significantly from management s expectations as of the date the investment was made, and where there have been no significant fluctuations in the market pricing for such investments, we may conclude that the Required Rate of Return is equal to the stated rate on the investment and therefore, the debt security is appropriately priced. In instances where we determine that the Required Rate of Return is different from the stated rate on the investment, we discount the contractual cash flows on the debt instrument using the Required Rate of Return in order to estimate the fair value of the debt security. 
  Fair value measurements using the Income Approach model can be sensitive to changes in one or more of the inputs. Assuming all other inputs to the Income Approach model remain constant, any increase (decrease) in the Required Rate of Return or Leverage Ratio inputs for a particular debt security would result in a lower (higher) fair value for that security.  
  
   57 

Assuming all other inputs to the Income Approach model remain constant, any increase (decrease) in the Adjusted EBITDA input for a particular debt security would result in a higher (lower) fair value for that security. 
  The fair value of our royalty rights are calculated based on specific provisions contained in the pertinent operating or royalty agreements. The determination of the fair value of such royalty rights is not a significant component of our valuation process. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Interest and Dividend Income 
  Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of original issue discount, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The cessation of recognition of such interest will negatively impact the reported fair value of the investment. We write off any previously accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that interest is no longer considered collectible. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. 
  We may have to include in our ICTI interest income, including OID income, from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. As a result, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements to maintain our RIC status, even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. Additionally, any loss recognized by us for federal income tax purposes on previously accrued interest income will be treated as a capital loss. 
  Fee Income 
  Origination, facility, commitment, consent and other advance fees received in connection with the origination of a loan, or Loan Origination Fees, are recorded as deferred income and recognized as investment income over the term of the loan. Upon prepayment of a loan, any unamortized Loan Origination Fees are recorded as investment income. In the general course of our business, we receive certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, certain investment banking and structuring fees and loan waiver and amendment fees, and are recorded as investment income when earned. 
  Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Interest Income 
  We currently hold, and we expect to hold in the future, some loans in our portfolio that contain PIK interest provisions. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the loan, rather than being paid to us in cash, and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of PIK interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. 
  PIK interest, which is a non-cash source of income until it is collected, is included in our taxable income and therefore affects the amount we are required to distribute to our stockholders to maintain our qualification as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, even though we have not yet collected the cash. Generally, when current cash interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing PIK interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. We write off any previously accrued and uncollected PIK interest when it is determined that the PIK interest is no longer collectible. 
  We may have to include in our ICTI, PIK interest income from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. As a result, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements, even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the normal course of business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, consisting primarily of unused commitments to extend financing to our portfolio companies. Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The balances of unused commitments to extend financing as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  We are subject to market risk. Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies we invest in; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes; legislative reform; local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability; and interest rate fluctuations. 
  In addition, we are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing debt and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. Our net investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including LIBOR, Canadian Dealer Offered Rate and prime rates. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk and determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were not a party to any hedging arrangements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   80.9%  , or   $686.9 million   (at cost), of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at fixed rates and   19.1%  , or   $161.8 million   (at cost), of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates, which are either prime-based or LIBOR-based, and many of which are subject to certain floors. A hypothetical 200 basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates on our variable-rate debt investments could increase or decrease, as applicable, our investment income by a maximum of   $3.2 million   on an annual basis. All of our SBA-guaranteed debentures, our December 2022 Notes and our March 2022 Notes bear interest at fixed rates. Our Credit Facility bears interest, subject to our election, on a per annum basis equal to (i) the applicable base rate plus 1.75% (or 1.50% if we receive an investment grade credit rating), (ii) the applicable LIBOR rate plus 2.75% (or 2.50% if we receive an investment grade credit rating), or (iii) for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, the applicable Canadian Dealer Offered Rate plus 2.75% (or 2.50% if we receive an investment grade credit rating). The applicable base rate is equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the adjusted one-month LIBOR plus 2.0%. The applicable LIBOR rate depends on the term of the draw under the Credit Facility. We pay a commitment fee of 1.00% per annum on undrawn amounts if the used portion of the facility is less than or equal to 25.0% of total commitments, or 0.375% per annum on undrawn amounts if the used portion of the facility is greater than 25.0% of total commitments.  
  Because we currently borrow, and plan to borrow in the future, money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. 
    
  We may also have exposure to foreign currencies (currently the Canadian dollar) related to certain investments. Such investments are translated into United States dollars based on the spot rate at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in the exchange rate. In order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates, we generally borrow in Canadian dollars under our Credit Facility to finance such investments. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had non-United States dollar borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars of $28.6 million ($21.7 million United States dollars) outstanding under the Credit Facility with a weighted average interest rate of 3.65%. 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. It should be noted that any system of controls,  
  
   60 

however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.     Legal Proceedings. 
  Neither Triangle Capital Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries is currently a party to any material pending legal proceedings. 
   
  Item 1A.     Risk Factors. 
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on   February 24, 2016  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results. There have been no material changes during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
   
  Item 2.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
  Sales of Unregistered Securities 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued 37,714 shares of our common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan. These issuances were not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The aggregate value for the shares of common stock issued during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   under the dividend reinvestment plan was approximately $0.7 million. 
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, 4,868 shares of our common stock were delivered to us at an average price per share of $20.09 in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations of holders of restricted shares issued under the Triangle Capital Corporation Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan that vested during the period. These shares are reflected in the following table:

employee  with respect to the current taxable year of the Company or with respect to the taxable year of the Company in which any applicable Award will be paid or vested.

In the case of Incentive Stock Options, the terms and conditions of such grants shall be subject to and comply with Section 422 of the Code, as from time to time amended, and any regulations implementing such statute. A person who has been granted an Option under this Plan may be granted additional Options under the Plan if the Board shall so determine; provided, however, that to the extent the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted) of the Shares with respect to which all Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by an Employee during any calendar year (under all plans described in of Section 422(d) of the Code of the Employee's employer corporation and its parent and Affiliates) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options.

Except in the case of Substitute Awards, the Option Price of an Option may not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which the Option is granted on the date of grant of such Option. Once established, the Option Price of any Option may not be changed absent an exemptive order from the SEC or written confirmation from its staff allowing the Company to do so.

  6.4.      Exercise  . 
    
  (a)Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may, in its sole discretion, specify in the applicable Award Agreement or thereafter. The Board shall have full and complete authority to determine, subject to   Section 6.5   herein, whether an Option will be exercisable in full at any time or from time to time  

during the term of the Option, or to provide for the exercise thereof in such installments, upon the occurrence of such events and at such times during the term of the Option as the Board may determine. 
    
  (b)The Board may impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options, including without limitation, any relating to the application of federal, state or foreign securities laws or the Code, as it may deem necessary or advisable. The exercise of any Option granted hereunder shall be effective only at such time as the sale of Shares pursuant to such exercise will not violate any state or federal securities or other laws. 
    
  (c)An Option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time, with respect to whole Shares only, within the period permitted thereunder for the exercise thereof, and shall be exercised by written notice of intent to exercise the Option, delivered to the Company at its principal office, and payment in full to the Company at the direction of the Board of the amount of the Option Price for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is then being exercised. 
    
  (d)Payment of the Option Price shall be made in cash or cash equivalents, or, at the discretion of the Board, (i) by transfer, either actually or by attestation, to the Company of Shares that have been held by the Participant for at least six (6) months (or such lesser period as may be permitted by the Board), valued at the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date of exercise, together with any applicable withholding taxes, such transfer to be upon such terms and conditions as determined by the Board, or (ii) by a combination of such cash (or cash equivalents) and such Shares; provided, however, that the optionee shall not be entitled to tender Shares pursuant to successive, substantially simultaneous exercises of an Option or any other stock option of the Company. Subject to applicable securities laws, an Option may also be exercised by delivering a notice of exercise of the Option and simultaneously selling the Shares thereby acquired, pursuant to a brokerage or similar agreement approved in advance by proper officers of the Company, using the proceeds of such sale as payment of the Option Price, together with any applicable withholding taxes. Until the optionee has been issued the Shares subject to such exercise, he or she shall possess no rights as a stockholder with respect to such Shares. 
    
  6.5.      Ten Percent Stock Rule  .

  (b)Each Restricted Share Award made under the Plan shall be for such number of Shares as shall be determined by the Board and set forth in the Award Agreement containing the terms of such Restricted Share Award. Such agreement shall set forth a period of time during which the grantee must remain in the continuous employment of the Company in order for the forfeiture and transfer restrictions to lapse. If the Board so determines, the restrictions may lapse during such restricted period in installments with respect to specified portions of the Shares covered by the Restricted Share Award. The Award Agreement may also, in the discretion of the Board, set forth performance or other conditions that will subject the Shares to forfeiture and transfer restrictions. The Board may, at its discretion, waive all or any part of the restrictions applicable to any or all outstanding Restricted Share Awards. 
    
  (c)Notwithstanding Sections 7.1(a) and 7.1(b) hereof, any grants of Restricted Shares to Non-Employee Directors under the Plan shall be automatic and shall not be changed without SEC approval. 
    
  7.2.      Delivery of Shares and Transfer Restrictions  .

Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement, any Shares, any other securities of the Company and any other property (except for cash dividends) distributed with respect to the Shares subject to Restricted Share Awards shall be subject to the same restrictions, terms and conditions as such restricted Shares. 
    
  7.3.      Termination of Restrictions  . At the end of the restricted period and provided that any other restrictive conditions of the Restricted Share Award are met, or at such earlier time as otherwise determined by the Board, all restrictions set forth in the Award Agreement relating to the Restricted Share Award or in the Plan shall lapse as to the restricted Shares subject thereto, and a stock certificate for the appropriate number of Shares, free of the restrictions and restricted stock legend, shall be delivered to the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary or estate, as the case may be.

Accordingly, unless otherwise determined by the Board, if any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement relating to such an Award does not comply or is inconsistent with Section 162(m), such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements, and no provision shall be deemed to confer upon the Board discretion to increase the amount of compensation otherwise payable to a Covered Officer in connection with any such Award upon the attainment of the performance criteria established by the Board.

Following the completion of each performance period, the Board shall certify in writing whether the applicable performance targets have been achieved and the amounts, if any, payable to Covered Officers for such performance period. In determining the amount earned by a Covered Officer for a given performance period, subject to any applicable Award Agreement, the Board shall have the right to reduce (but not increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Board may deem relevant in its sole discretion to the assessment of individual performance for the performance period.

  13.5.   Exercise Price of Awards  . Once established, the exercise price of an Award shall not be changed absent an exemptive order from the SEC or written confirmation from its staff that the Company may do so.

  14.2.      Dividends  .

All certificates for Shares or other securities of the Company or any Affiliate delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Board may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations and other requirements of the SEC or any state securities commission or regulatory authority, any stock exchange or other market upon which such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any applicable Federal or state laws, and the Board may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. 
    
  14.5.      Withholding  . A Participant may be required to pay to the Company or any Affiliate any applicable withholding or other tax-related obligations in respect of an Award, its exercise or any other transaction involving an Award, including the vesting thereof, or any payment or transfer under an Award or under the Plan.

  14.6.      Award Agreements  . Each Award hereunder shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall be delivered to the Participant and may specify the terms and conditions of the Award and any rules applicable thereto.

The Board shall, subject to applicable law, determine the date an Award is deemed to be granted. The Board or, except to the extent prohibited under applicable law, its delegate(s) may establish the terms of agreements or other documents evidencing Awards under this Plan and may, but need not, require as a condition to any such agreement's or document's effectiveness that such agreement or document be executed by the Participant, including by electronic signature or other electronic indication of acceptance, and that such Participant agree to such further terms and conditions as specified in such agreement or document. The grant of an Award under this Plan shall not confer any rights upon the Participant holding such Award other than such terms, and subject to such conditions, as are specified in this Plan as being applicable to such type of Award (or to all Awards) or as are expressly set forth in the agreement or other document evidencing such Award. 
    
  14.7.      No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements  . Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other compensation arrangements, which may, but need not, provide for the grant of Options or Restricted Shares. 

14.8.      No Right to Employment  . The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving an Employee the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss an Employee from employment, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in an Award Agreement. 
    
  14.9.      No Rights as Stockholder  . Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, no Participant or holder or beneficiary of any Award shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares to be distributed under the Plan until such person has become a holder of such Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with each grant of Restricted Shares hereunder, the applicable Award Agreement shall specify if and to what extent the Participant shall not be entitled to the rights of a stockholder in respect of such Restricted Shares. 
    
  14.10.   Governing Law  . The validity, construction and effect of the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles. 
    
  14.11.   Severability  . If any provision of the Plan or any Award is, or becomes, or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Board, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Board, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. 
    
  14.12.   Other Laws  . The Board may refuse to issue or transfer any Shares or other consideration under an Award if, acting in its sole discretion, it determines that the issuance or transfer of such Shares or such other consideration might violate any applicable law or regulation (including applicable non-U.S. laws or regulations) or entitle the Company to recover the same under Exchange Act Section 16(b), and any payment tendered to the Company by a Participant, other holder or beneficiary in connection with the exercise of such Award shall be promptly refunded to the relevant Participant, holder or beneficiary. 
    
  14.13.   No Trust or Fund Created  . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate. 
    
  14.14.   No Fractional Shares  . No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Board shall determine whether cash, other securities or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated. 

14.15.   Headings  . Headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.

  Section 15.   Term Of The Plan  . 
    
  15.1.      Effective Date  . The Plan shall become effective upon approval by the stockholders of the Company and the Board; provided, however, that the Plan shall not be effective with respect to any Award to a Non-Employee Director or any award of Restricted Shares unless the Company has received an order from the SEC that permits such Award. 
    
  15.2.      Expiration Date  . No new Awards shall be granted under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an applicable Award Agreement, any Award granted hereunder may, and the authority of the Board to amend, alter, adjust, suspend, discontinue or terminate any such Award or to waive any conditions or rights under any such Award shall, continue after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date.

  Section 3.4  Special Rules Related to Distributions.  
    
  (a)    Unforeseeable Emergency Distributions  .  The Committee may at any time, upon written request of the Participant, cause to be paid to such Participant an amount equal to all or any part of such Participant s Deferred Compensation Benefits if the Committee determines, in its absolute discretion based on such reasonable evidence that it shall require, that such a payment or payments is necessary for the purpose of alleviating the consequences of an Unforeseeable Emergency occurring with respect to the Participant.  This decision will be determined based upon the relevant facts and circumstances of each case.  Payments of amounts because of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be permitted only to the extent reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need (including amounts necessary to pay any Federal, state, local or foreign income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution) and shall not be permitted to the extent such need may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant s assets (to the extent liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or by the cessation of deferrals under the Plan.  
    
  (b)    Small Accounts  .  If a Participant s Account is $18,000 (this amount shall be adjusted annually for cost-of-living increases consistent with Section 402(g)(4) of the Code) or less at the time of the Participant s Separation from Service, such Participant s Deferred Compensation Benefits shall automatically be paid to him in a single lump sum payment as soon as practicable following his Separation from Service.  
    
  Section 3.5  Withholding  .  Each Employer shall withhold from a Participant s Base Salary or Bonus such amounts as are necessary to satisfy its withholding obligations thereunder as to any Deferrals by the Participant. In addition, each Employer shall deduct from any distributions hereunder any taxes or other amounts required by law to be withheld therefrom.  
    
  Section 3.6  Participants  Accounts  .  Each Employer shall establish and maintain a Deferral Account and an Employer Contributions Account for each Participant and such sub-accounts as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate.

Each Employer Contributions Account so established shall be credited as appropriate for Employer Contributions and Earnings with respect to such Employer Contributions and debited for any distributions from such Account.  
    
  Section 3.7  Delay of Payment for Specified Employees  .

   7 

Specified Employee of the Company and that any payments to be provided to the Participant pursuant to this Plan upon the Participant s Separation from Service are or may become subject to the additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code or any other taxes or penalties imposed under Section 409A of the Code (   Section 409A Taxes   ) if provided at the time otherwise required under this Plan, then such payments shall be delayed until the date that is six months after the date of the Participant s Separation from Service from the Company, or such shorter period that, as determined by the Committee, is sufficient to avoid the imposition of Section 409A Taxes (the    Payment Delay Period   ).

A Participant may, at any time and from time to time, change a Beneficiary designation hereunder without the consent of any existing Beneficiary or any other person.  Any change in Beneficiary shall be made by giving written notice thereof to the Committee and any change shall be effective only if received by the Committee prior to the death of the Participant.  
    
  Section 4.3  Distributions to Beneficiaries  .  The Beneficiary or Beneficiaries of a Participant shall be entitled to receive the unpaid Deferred Compensation Benefits to which the Participant was entitled at his death payable in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the date of the Participant s death.  

ARTICLE V 
  MISCELLANEOUS 
    
  Section 5.1  Liability of Employer  .  Nothing in this Plan shall constitute the creation of a trust or other fiduciary relationship between an Employer and any Participant, Beneficiary or any other person.  
    
  Section 5.2  Ownership of Assets; Relationship with Company  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Participants shall have no right, title or interest whatsoever in or to the Accounts or the Deferred Compensation Benefits. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.  

8 

Section 5.3  No Guarantee of Employment  .  Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as guaranteeing future employment to any Participant. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, except as otherwise set forth in a written agreement, a Participant continues to be an employee of an Employer solely at the will of such Employer subject to discharge at any time, with or without cause.  
    
  Section 5.4  Payment to Guardian  .  If a benefit payable hereunder is payable to a minor, to a person declared incompetent or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of his property, the Committee may direct payment of such benefit to the guardian, legal representative or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent or person.  The Committee may require such proof of incompetency, minority, incapacity or guardianship as it may deem appropriate prior to distribution of the benefit.  Such distribution shall completely discharge the Employers from all liability with respect to such benefit.  
    
  Section 5.5  Assignment  .  No right or interest under this Plan of any Participant or Beneficiary shall be assignable or transferable in any manner or be subject to alienation, anticipation, sale, pledge, encumbrance or other legal process or in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts or liabilities of the Participant or Beneficiary.  
    
  Section 5.6  Severability  .  If any provision of this Plan or the application thereof to any circumstance(s) or person(s) is held to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the Plan and the application of such provision to other circumstances or persons shall not be affected thereby.  
    
  Section 5.7  Expenses; Liability for Benefits  .  Each Employer shall be liable for the payment of the Deferred Compensation Benefits which are payable hereunder to its employees and for its pro rata portion of the expenses of administering the Plan, as determined by the Committee.  
    
  Section 5.8  Top Hat Plan  .  The Plan is designed primarily for purposes of providing benefits for a select group of management and highly compensated employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries that adopt the Plan.  It is intended to qualify as a  top hat  plan under Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  

ARTICLE VI 
  ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN 
    
  Section 6.1  Administration.  
    
  (a)    General  .    The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.  The Committee shall have sole and absolute discretion to interpret where necessary all provisions of the Plan (including, without limitation, by supplying omissions from, correcting deficiencies in, or resolving inconsistencies or ambiguities in, the language of the Plan), to determine the rights and status under the Plan of Participants or other persons, to resolve questions or disputes arising under the Plan and to make any determinations with respect to the benefits payable under the Plan and the persons entitled thereto as may be necessary for the purposes of the Plan.  The Committee s determination of the rights of any employee or former employee hereunder shall be final and binding on all persons, subject only to the appeal provisions outlined in Section 6.3 hereof.  
    
  (b)    Compliance with Section 409A  .    The Plan is intended to comply with or be exempt from (as applicable) the provisions of Section 409A, and the Committee shall interpret the Plan in a manner  
  
   9 

consistent therewith.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event the Committee determines that any amounts payable hereunder will be taxable to a Participant under Section 409A, to the extent permitted by 409A, the Company may (i) adopt such amendments to this Plan and policies and procedures, including amendments and policies with retroactive effect, that the Company determines are necessary or appropriate to preserve the intended tax treatment of the Plan and/or (ii) take such other actions as the Company determines are necessary or appropriate to comply with the requirements of Section 409A. For purposes of Section 409A, a Participant s right to receive installment payments pursuant to the Plan shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment shall be considered at all times a separate and distinct payment. 
    
  None of the Company, its affiliates or their respective managers, directors, officers, employees or advisors (A) makes any representations with respect to the application of Section 409A to the Plan, and (B)  shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owned by an Participant or other taxpayer as a result of the Plan.   
  (c)    Delegation of Duties  .    The Committee may delegate any of its administrative duties, including, without limitation, duties with respect to the processing, review, investigation, approval and payment of Deferred Compensation Benefits, to a named administrator or administrators.  
    
  Section 6.2  Regulations  .  The Committee may promulgate any rules and regulations it deems necessary in order to carry out the purposes of the Plan or to interpret the provisions of the Plan;   provided, however,   that no rule, regulation or interpretation shall be contrary to the provisions of the Plan.  The rules, regulations and interpretations made by the Committee shall, subject only to the appeal provisions outlined in Section 6.3 hereof, be final and binding on all persons.  
    
  Section 6.3  Appeal Provisions  .  The Committee shall determine the rights of any employee or former employee to any Deferred Compensation Benefits hereunder.  Any employee or former employee who believes that he has not received the Deferred Compensation Benefits to which he is entitled under the Plan may file a claim in writing with the Committee.  The Committee shall, no later than 90 days after the receipt of a claim (unless special circumstances require an extension of up to 90 additional days, provided that written notice of the extension of time is given to the claimant within the first 90 day period), either allow or deny the claim in writing.  If a claimant does not receive written notice of the Committee s decision on his claim within the above-mentioned period, the claim shall be deemed to have been denied in full.  
  A denial of a claim by the Committee, wholly or partially, shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall include:  
  (a)    the specific reasons for the denial;  
    
  (b)    specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;  
    
  (c)    a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and  
    
  (d)    an explanation of the claim review procedure.  
  A claimant whose claim is denied (or his duly authorized representative) may within 60 days after receipt of denial of a claim file with the Committee a written request for a review of such claim.  If the claimant does not file a request for review of his claim within such 60-day period, the claimant shall be  
  
   10 

deemed to have acquiesced in the original decision of the Committee on his claim.  If such an appeal is so filed within such 60-day period, the Company (or its delegate) shall conduct a full and fair review of such claim.  During such review, the claimant shall be given the opportunity to review documents that are pertinent to his claim and to submit issues and comments in writing.   
    
  The Company shall mail or deliver to the claimant a written decision on the matter based on the facts and the pertinent provisions of the Plan within 60 days after the receipt of the request for review (unless special circumstances require an extension of up to 60 additional days, in which case written notice of such extension shall be given to the claimant prior to the commencement of such extension).  Such decision shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, shall state the specific reasons for the decision and the specific Plan provisions on which the decision was based and shall, to the extent permitted by law, be final and binding on all interested persons.  If the decision on review is not furnished to the claimant within the above-mentioned time period, the claim shall be deemed to have been denied on review.  
    
  Section 6.4  Revocability of Committee/Company Action  .  Any action taken by the Committee with respect to the rights or benefits under the Plan of any employee or former employee shall be revocable by the Committee as to payments not yet made to such person, and acceptance of any Deferred Compensation Benefits under the Plan constitutes acceptance of and agreement to the Committee s or the Company s making any appropriate adjustments in future payments to such person (or to recover from such person) any excess payment or underpayment previously made to him.  
    
  Section 6.5  Amendment  .  The Committee may at any time (without the consent of any Subsidiary which adopts the Plan) amend any or all of the provisions of this Plan, except that no such amendment may (a) reduce the balance of any Participant s Account as of the date of such amendment, (b) change the time or form of distribution from a Participant s Account or (c) change the provisions of the Plan applicable to a Participant s Account upon a Change in Control, without the prior written consent of such Participant.  Any amendment shall be in the form of a written instrument executed by an officer of the Company pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Committee.  Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5, such amendment shall become effective as of the date specified in such instrument or, if no such date is specified, on the date of its execution.  
    
  Section 6.6  Termination  .  The Committee, in its discretion (without the consent of any Subsidiary which adopts the Plan), may terminate this Plan and pay amounts due hereunder to the full extent permitted by and in accordance with Section 409A of the Code (including, but not limited to, Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations), except that no such termination may (a) reduce the balance of any Participant s Account as of the date of such termination or (b) materially change the provisions of the Plan applicable to a Participant s Account upon a Change in Control, without the prior written consent of such Participant.  Any such termination shall be expressed in the form of a written instrument executed by an officer of the Company pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Committee.  Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.6, such termination shall become effective as of the date specified in such instrument or, if no such date is specified, on the date of its execution.  Written notice of any termination shall be given to the Participants as soon as practicable after the instrument is executed.

    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;
