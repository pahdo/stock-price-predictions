     Table of Contents          MakingORG, Inc.     NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)       NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION      MakingORG, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 10, 2012. The Company now intends to open a line of organic food stores or stores-in-stores within the Asian communities in the United States. The trading symbol of the Company is "CQCQ" and the fiscal year end is December 31.     The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s most recent Annual Financial Statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.      NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Use of Estimates      The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used in valuing the fair value of common stock issued for services, among others. Actual results could differ from these estimates.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk including our own credit risk.     In addition to defining fair value, the standard expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:     Level 1   inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.     Level 2   inputs are based upon significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.     Level 3   inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.     As of September 30, 2016, the balances reported for cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of their short maturities. Notes payable are recorded at agreed values.                    6       
     Table of Contents           Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements      Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. The Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.      NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN      The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company had no revenues as of September 30, 2016. The Company has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.     Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.      NOTE 4       DUE TO RELATED PARTY      In support of the Company's efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders or directors. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances were considered temporary in nature and were not formalized by a promissory note.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company's sole officer advanced to the Company an amount of $28,088 by the way of loan. The officer paid expenses directly on behalf of the Company. As at September 30, 2016, the Company was obligated to the officer, for an unsecured, non-interest bearing demand loan with a balance of $66,397.      NOTE 5       CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE      On September 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Convertible Note Agreement in the principal amount of $200,000 with an unrelated party. The note bears interest at 12% per annum and the holder is able to convert all unpaid interest and principal into common shares at $3.50 per share. The note matures on September 1, 2018. The Company recognized a discount on the note of $38,857 at the agreement date.     The Company recognized interest expense related to the debt discount of $3,619 for the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2016. The unamortized debt discount at September 30, 2016 is $37,238.      NOTE 6       SUBSEQUENT EVENT      The Company has evaluated all other subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued, and determine that there were no other subsequent events or transactions that require recognition or disclosures in the financial statements.      On October 20, 2016, the Company filed documents registering their intention to transact interstate business in the state of California.                 7       
     Table of Contents            Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       As used in this Form 10-Q, references to  MakingORG ,  the  Company,   we,   our  or  us  refer to MakingORG, Inc. unless the context otherwise indicates.      Forward-Looking Statements      The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q (the  Report ). This Report contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.     While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as otherwise required under the applicable federal securities laws.       Plan of Operation        Given our limited resources and the fact that we have never generated any revenues from the sale of our products, we are no longer focused on operating a business and have abandoned our initial business plan. Although our sole officer and director intends to have the Company open a line of organic food stores or stores-in-stores within the Asian communities in the United States, we might just identify and negotiate with another company for the business combination or merger of that entity with and into our company. We would seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in one or more business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of a publicly held corporation. At this time, we have no plan, proposal, agreement, understanding or arrangement to acquire or merge with any specific business or company, and the Company has not identified any specific business or company for investigation and evaluation. No member of management or promoter of the Company has had any material discussions with any other company with respect to any acquisition of that company.     We will not restrict our search for another target company to any specific business, industry or geographical location, and the Company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature. The discussion of the proposed plan of operation under this caption and throughout this Quarterly Report is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of the Company's virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities.     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim financial statements contained in this Report and in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K filed on March 25, 2016. Results for interim periods may not be indicative of results for the full year.      Results of Operations        For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015        Revenues      The Company did not generate any revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.      Total operating expenses      For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses were $4,652, which included $4,250 of professional fees and $402 of miscellaneous expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, total operating expenses were $5,278, which included $4,937 of professional fees and $341 of miscellaneous expenses.                  8       
     Table of Contents          Net Loss      For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $8,271, as compared to a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $5,278.        For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015        Revenues      The Company did not generate any revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.      Total operating expenses      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses were $20,332, which included $19,722 of professional fees and $610 of miscellaneous expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, total operating expenses were $22,850, which included $22,310 of professional fees and $540 of miscellaneous expenses.      Net Loss      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $23,951, as compared to a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $22,850.       Liquidity and Capital Resources      As at September 30, 2016, our total assets were cash of $205,456 and our current liabilities were $73,579. The Company believes that it will require $100,000 for the next twelve months to fund operations. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to the Company. Other than the oral agreement of Mrs. Cui, our sole officer, director, and majority stockholder, to lend the Company funds, the Company currently has no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. We may have to issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. Since the Company has no such arrangements or plans currently in effect, its inability to raise funds for the above purposes will have a severe negative impact on its ability to remain a viable company.      Cash Flows from Operating Activities      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $22,632 resulting from a net loss of $23,951, a decrease in accrued liabilities of $300, offset by amortization of debt discount of $1,619. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $20,772 resulting from a net loss of $22,850, offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $2,078.       Cash Flows from Financing Activities      We have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of a convertible promissory note and advances from the Company s sole officer and director. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had cash flows provided by the issuance of a convertible promissory note of $200,000 and advances from the Company s sole officer and director of $28,088. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, advances from the Company s sole officer and director provided $20,772.      Cash Flows from Non-Cash Financing Activities      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-cash financing activities included $38,857 related to beneficial conversion feature recognized.      Going Concern Consideration      The Company had no revenues and incurred a net loss of $23,951 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company is currently dependent on additional capital to continue to fund operations. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to the Company. Other than the oral agreement of our sole officer, director, and majority stockholder to lend the Company funds, the Company currently has no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       A smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item.                  9       
     Table of Contents           Item 4. Controls and Procedures        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that the Company's disclosure and controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      Based on management's assessment, the Company determined that there were material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on the material weaknesses described below:     Because the Company consists of one person who acts as the sole officer and director of the Company, there are limited controls over information processing.     There is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives as management is composed of only one person. In order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty is feasible.     The Company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process.     There is a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions.     The Company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions.     As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness; yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company's financial reporting.     In order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness, we have engaged an outside accounting consultant with significant experience in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that these financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes that this will lessen the possibility of a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements or will prevent or detect such misstatement on a timely basis. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of this action and make any changes that our management deems appropriate.              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings       There are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of the Company, or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company. The Company s property is not the subject of any pending legal proceedings.        Item 1A. Risk Factors       A smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item.       Item 2.
