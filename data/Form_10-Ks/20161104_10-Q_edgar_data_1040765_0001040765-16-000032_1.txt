VORNADO REALTY L.P.      

      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      

      (UNAUDITED)       

1.     Organization    

   Vornado
Realty L.P. (the  Operating Partnership  and/or the  Company ) is a Delaware
limited partnership.  Vornado Realty Trust ( Vornado ) is the sole general
partner of, and owned approximately 93.7% of the common limited partnership
interest in, the Operating Partnership at September 30, 2016.  All references
to  we,   us,   our,  the  Company  and  Operating Partnership  refer to
Vornado Realty L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries      .   

2.   
Basis of Presentation     

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited and include the
accounts of Vornado Realty L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  All inter-company
amounts have been eliminated. In our opinion, all adjustments (which include
only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial
position, results of operations and changes in cash flows have been made.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. 
These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q of the Securities and Exchange Commission       (     SEC )
and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for
the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC.   

We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  The results of operations for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results for the full year.             

3.    Recently
Issued Accounting Literature                  

In May 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board    
  (     FASB ) issued an update ( ASU
2014-09 ) establishing Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic
606,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers    ( ASC 606 ).  ASU 2014-09
establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for
revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the
existing revenue recognition guidance.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to
recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain
additional disclosures.  In August 2015, the FASB issued an update ( ASU
2015-14 ) to ASC 606,    Deferral of the Effective Date   , which defers the
adoption of ASU 2014-09 to interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years
that begin after December 15, 2017.  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update
( ASU 2016-08 ) to ASC 606,    Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
Revenue Gross versus Net)   , which clarifies the implementation guidance on
principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard
pursuant to ASU 2014-09.  In April 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU
2016-10 ) to ASC 606,    Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ,
which clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and
licensing implementation guidance contained in ASU 2014-09.  In May 2016, the
FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-12 ) to ASC 606,    Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients   , which amends certain aspects of the new revenue
recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09.  We are currently evaluating the
impact of the adoption of these ASUs on our consolidated financial statements.        

In June
2014, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2014-12 ) to ASC Topic 718,    Compensation
  Stock Compensation    ( ASC 718 ).  ASU 2014-12 requires an entity to treat
performance targets that can be met after the requisite service period of a
share based award has ended, as a performance condition that affects vesting. 
ASU 2014-12 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal
years that began after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this update as of
January 1, 2016, did not have any impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

3.   
Recently Issued Accounting Literature - continued         

           In February 2015, the FASB issued
an update ( ASU 2015-02 )    Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis    to
ASC Topic 810,    Consolidation   .  ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities
that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal
entities.  Specifically, the amendments: (i) modify the evaluation of whether
limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities
( VIEs ) or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminate the presumption
that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect
the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs,
and (iv) provide a scope exception for certain entities.  ASU 2015-02 is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2015.  The adoption of this update on January 1, 2016 resulted in the
identification of additional VIEs, but did not have an impact on our
consolidated financial statements other than additional disclosures   (see Note 14 -    Variable Interest Entities   )   .             

In January 2016, the FASB issued
an update ( ASU 2016-01 )    Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities    to ASC Topic 825,    Financial Instruments   . 
ASU 2016-01 amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation
and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure
certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized
in net income.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are
currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our
consolidated financial statements.           

In February 2016, the FASB issued
( ASU 2016-02 )    Leases   , which sets out the principles for the
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both
lessees and lessors.  ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a dual approach,
classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle
of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase.  Lessees
are required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all
leases with a term of greater than 12 months. Leases with a term of 12 months
or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating
leases.  Lessees will recognize expense based on the effective interest method
for finance leases or on a straight-line basis for operating leases.  The new
standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is
substantially equivalent to existing guidance.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption
permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU
2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.           

In March
2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-09 )    Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting    to ASC 718.  ASU 2016-09 amends several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the
income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective
for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.       

In August 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-15 )   
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    to ASC Topic
230,    Statement of Cash Flows   . ASU 2016-15 clarifies guidance on the
classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash
flows to reduce diversity in practice with respect to (i) debt prepayment or
debt extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or
other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in
relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (iii) contingent
consideration payments made after a business combination, (iv) proceeds from
the settlement of insurance claims, (v) proceeds from the settlement of
corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies,
(vi) distributions received from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial
interests in securitization transactions, and (viii) separately
identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. 
ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. 
The adoption of this update is not expected to have a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements.                

4.    Acquisitions        

On May 20,
2016, we contributed $19,650,000 for a 50.0% equity interest in a joint venture
that will develop 606 Broadway, a 33,000 square foot office and retail building,
located on Houston Street in Manhattan.  The development cost of this project
is estimated to be approximately $104,000,000.  At closing, the joint venture
obtained a $65,000,000 construction loan, of which approximately $22,500,000 was
outstanding at September 30, 2016.  The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR
plus 3.00% (3.52% at September 30, 2016), matures in May 2019 with two one-year
extension options.  Because this joint venture is a VIE and we determined we
are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the accounts of this joint venture
from the date of our investment.

5.     Real Estate Fund Investments    

We
are the general partner and investment manager of Vornado Capital Partners Real
Estate Fund (the  Fund ), which has an eight-year term and a three-year
investment period that ended in July 2013.    The Fund is accounted for under ASC
946,    Financial Services   Investment Companies    ( ASC 946 ) and its
investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair value, with changes in
value each period recognized in earnings.  We consolidate the accounts of the
Fund into our consolidated financial statements, retaining the fair value basis
of accounting.   

We
are also the general partner and investment manager of Crowne Plaza Times
Square Hotel Co-Investment (the  Co-Investment ), which owns the 24.7% interest
in the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel not owned by the Fund.    The Co-Investment is also accounted
for under ASC 946.  We consolidate the accounts of the Co-Investment into our
consolidated financial statements, retaining the fair value basis of
accounting.   

At
September 30, 2016, we had six real estate fund investments with an aggregate
fair value of $519,386,000, or $210,451,000 in excess of cost, and had
remaining unfunded commitments of $117,907,000, of which our share was $34,422,000. 
  Below is a summary of income from
the Fund and the Co-Investment for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.

7.    Investments in Partially Owned Entities    

Alexander s,
Inc. ( Alexander s ) (NYSE: ALX)    

   As of September
30, 2016, we own 1,654,068 Alexander s common shares, representing a 32.4%
interest in Alexander s.  We account for our investment in Alexander s under
the equity method.  We manage, lease and develop Alexander s properties
pursuant to agreements which expire in March of each year and are automatically
renewable.    

   As of September
30, 2016, the market value ( fair value  pursuant to ASC Topic 820,    Fair
Value Measurements    ( ASC 820 )) of our investment in Alexander s, based on
Alexander s September 30, 2016 closing share price of $419.60, was
$694,047,000, or $563,562,000 in excess of the carrying amount on our
consolidated balance sheet.  As of September 30, 2016, the carrying amount of
our investment in Alexander s, excluding amounts owed to us, exceeds our share
of the equity in the net assets of Alexander s by approximately $39,778,000. 
The majority of this basis difference resulted from the excess of our purchase
price for the Alexander s common stock acquired over the book value of
Alexander s net assets.  Substantially all of this basis difference was
allocated, based on our estimates of the fair values of Alexander s assets and
liabilities, to real estate (land and buildings).  We are amortizing the basis
difference related to the buildings into earnings as additional depreciation
expense over their estimated useful lives.  This depreciation is not material
to our share of equity in Alexander s net income.  The basis difference related
to the land will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.     

Urban Edge Properties ( UE ) (NYSE: UE)        

As of September 30, 2016, we own
5,717,184 UE operating partnership units, representing a 5.4% ownership
interest in UE.  We account for our investment in UE under the equity method
and record our share of UE s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis. 
During 2015, we provided transition services to UE, primarily for information
technology, human resources, tax and financial planning.  In 2016, we continue
to provide UE information technology support.  UE is providing us with leasing
and property management services for (i) certain small retail properties that
we plan to sell, and (ii) our affiliate, Alexander s, Rego Park retail assets. 
As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of our investment in UE, based on UE s
September 30, 2016 closing share price of $28.14, was $160,882,000, or $135,065,000
in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet.       

Pennsylvania
Real Estate Investment Trust ( PREIT ) (NYSE: PEI)        

As of September 30, 2016, we own
6,250,000 PREIT operating partnership units, representing an 8.0% interest in
PREIT.  We account for our investment in PREIT under the equity method and
record our share of PREIT s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag basis.  As
of September 30, 2016, the fair value of our investment in PREIT, based on
PREIT s September 30, 2016 closing share price of $23.03, was $143,938,000, or
$19,638,000 in excess of the carrying amount on our consolidated balance
sheet.  As of September 30, 2016, the carrying amount of our investment in
PREIT exceeds our share of the equity in the net assets of PREIT by
approximately $66,596,000.  The majority of this basis difference resulted from
the excess of the fair value of the PREIT operating units received over our
share of the book value of PREIT s net assets.  Substantially all of this basis
difference was allocated, based on our estimates of the fair values of PREIT s
assets and liabilities, to real estate (land and buildings).  We are amortizing
the basis difference related to the buildings into earnings as additional
depreciation expense over their estimated useful lives.  This depreciation is
not material to our share of equity in PREIT s net loss.  The basis difference
related to the land will be recognized upon disposition of our investment.

One Park
Avenue        

On March 7, 2016, the joint
venture, in which we have a 55% ownership interest, completed a $300,000,000
refinancing of One Park Avenue, a 947,000 square foot Manhattan office
building.  The loan matures in March 2021 and is interest only at LIBOR
plus 1.75% (2.28% at September 30, 2016).  The property was previously
encumbered by a 4.995%, $250,000,000 mortgage which matured in March 2016.       

Mezzanine
Loan   New York        

On March 17, 2016, we entered
into a joint venture, in which we own a 33.3% interest, which owns a $146,004,000
mezzanine loan.  The interest rate is LIBOR plus 8.875% (9.38% at September 30,
2016) and the debt matures in November 2016, with two three-month extension
options.  At September 30, 2016, the joint venture has a $3,996,000 remaining
commitment, of which our share is $1,332,000.  The joint venture s investment
is subordinate to $350,000,000 of third party debt.  We account for our
investment in the joint venture under the equity method.

2016, the joint venture, in which we have a 55% ownership interest, completed a
$273,000,000 refinancing of The Warner Building, a 621,000 square foot
Washington, DC office building.  The loan matures in June 2023, has a fixed
rate of 3.65%, is interest only for the first two years and amortizes based on
a 30-year schedule beginning in year three. The property was previously
encumbered by a 6.26%, $293,000,000 mortgage which matured in May 2016.     

280 Park
Avenue      

On May 11,
2016, the joint venture, in which we have a 50% ownership interest, completed a
$900,000,000 refinancing of 280 Park Avenue, a 1,250,000 square foot Manhattan
office building.  The three-year loan with four one-year extensions is interest
only at LIBOR plus 2.00% (2.51% at September 30, 2016).  The property was
previously encumbered by a 6.35%, $721,000,000 mortgage which was scheduled to
mature in June 2016.     

7 West
34th Street      

On May 16,
2016, we completed a $300,000,000 recourse financing of 7 West 34th Street, a
477,000 square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon.  The ten-year
loan is interest only at a fixed rate of 3.65% and matures in June 2026.  Subsequently,
on May 27, 2016, we sold a 47% ownership interest in this property and retained
the remaining 53% interest.  This transaction was based on a property value of
approximately $561,000,000 or $1,176 per square foot.  We received net proceeds
of $127,382,000 from the sale and realized a net gain of $203,324,000, of which
$159,511,000 was recognized in the second quarter and is included in  net gain
on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets  in our consolidated
statements of income.  The remaining net gain of $43,813,000 has been deferred
until our guarantee of payment of loan principal and interest is removed or the
loan is repaid.   We realized a net tax gain of $90,017,000.  We continue to
manage and lease the property.  We share control over major decisions with our
joint venture partner.  Accordingly, this property is accounted for under the
equity method from the date of sale.     

50-70
West 93rd Street      

On August 3,
2016, the joint venture, in which we have 49.9% ownership interest, completed
an $80,000,000 refinancing of 50-70 West 93rd Street, a 326 unit Manhattan
residential complex.  The three-year loan with two one-year extensions is
interest only at LIBOR plus 1.70% (2.22% at September 30, 2016).  The property
was previously encumbered by a $44,980,000 first mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.90%
and an $18,481,000 second mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.65%, which were scheduled to
mature in September 2016.

The following summarizes our identified intangible assets
(primarily above-market leases) and liabilities (primarily acquired
below-market leases) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.       

Amortization
of acquired below-market leases, net of acquired above-market leases, resulted
in an increase to rental income of $      11,868,000      
and $  19,786,000   for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $  41,676,000   and $  45,614,000   for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Estimated annual amortization of
acquired below    -    market leases, net of acquired above-market leases, for each of the five
succeeding years commencing January 1, 2017 is as follows:     

Amortization
of all other identified intangible assets (a component of depreciation and
amortization expense) was $      6,918,000      
and $  12,908,000   for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $  22,777,000   and $  24,402,000   for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    Estimated annual amortization of all
other identified intangible assets including acquired in-place leases, customer
relationships, and third party contracts for each of the five succeeding years
commencing January 1, 2017 is as follows:       

We are a tenant under ground leases for certain
properties.  Amortization of these acquired below-market leases, net of
above-market leases, resulted in an increase to rent expense of $      458,000      
and $  458,000   for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $  1,374,000   and $  1,374,000   for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.    Estimated
annual amortization of these below-market leases, net of above-market leases,
for each of the five succeeding years commencing January 1, 2017 is as follows:

10.    Debt        

         The following is a summary of our debt    :         

On February 8, 2016, we completed a $700,000,000
refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square foot Manhattan office
building.  The five-year loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.75%,
(2.28% at September 30, 2016) which was swapped for four and a half years to a
fixed rate of 2.56%.  The Company realized net proceeds of approximately
$330,000,000.  The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65%, $353,000,000
mortgage which was scheduled to mature in March 2016.       

On September
6, 2016, we completed a $675,000,000 refinancing of theMART, a 3,644,000 square
foot commercial building in Chicago.  The five-year loan is interest only and
has a fixed rate of 2.70%.  The Company realized net proceeds of approximately
$124,000,000.  The property was previously encumbered by a 5.57%, $550,000,000
mortgage which was scheduled to mature in December 2016.     

Skyline Properti     es   

On March 15, 2016, we notified the servicer of the
$678,000,000 non-recourse mortgage loan on the Skyline properties in Virginia
that cash flow will be insufficient to service the debt and pay other property
related costs and expenses and that we were not willing to fund additional cash
shortfalls.  Accordingly, at our request, the loan has been transferred to the
special servicer.  Consequently, based on our shortened estimated holding
period for the underlying assets, we concluded that the excess of carrying
amount over our estimate of fair value was not recoverable and recognized a
$160,700,000 non-cash impairment loss in the first quarter of 2016.  The
Company s estimate of fair value was derived from a discounted cash flow model
based upon market conditions and expectations of growth and utilized
unobservable quantitative inputs including a capitalization rate of 8.0% and a
discount rate of 8.2%.  In the second quarter of 2016, cash flow became
insufficient to service the debt and we ceased making debt service payments. 
Pursuant to the loan agreement, the loan is in default, causing the loan to be
immediately due and payable, and is subject to incremental default interest
which increased the weighted average interest rate from 2.97% to 4.51% while
the outstanding balance remains unpaid. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we accrued $2,632,000 and $5,343,000 of default interest
expense, respectively.  We continue to negotiate with the special servicer.
There can be no assurance as to the timing or ultimate resolution of this
matter.

11.    Redeemable Partnership Units    

Redeemable partnership units on our consolidated balance sheets
are comprised primarily of Class A units held by third parties and are recorded
at the greater of their carrying amount or redemption value at the end of each
reporting period.  Changes in the value from period to period are charged to  partners 
capital  on our consolidated balance sheets.          Below is a table summarizing the
activity of our redeemable partnership units.       

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate redemption value of
redeemable Class A units, which are those units held by third parties, was $      1,242,895,000      
and $  1,223,793,000  , respectively.       

Redeemable partnership
units exclude our Series G-1 through G-4 convertible preferred units and Series
D-13 cumulative redeemable preferred units, as they are accounted for as
liabilities in accordance with ASC 480,    Distinguishing Liabilities and
Equity   , because of their possible settlement by issuing a variable number
of Vornado common shares.        Accordingly,
the fair value of these units is included as a component of  other liabilities 
on our consolidated balance sheets and aggregated $50,561,000 as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    Changes in the value from period to period,
if any, are charged to  interest and debt expense  in our consolidated
statements of income.       

12.    Partners  Capital        

On September 1, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding 6.875%
Series J cumulative redeemable preferred units at their redemption price of
$25.00 per unit, or $246,250,000 in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid distributions
through the date of redemption.  In connection therewith, we expensed
$7,408,000 of issuance costs, which reduced net income attributable to Class A
unitholders in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  These costs had been
initially recorded as a reduction of partners  capital.

Variable Interest Entities    

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, we have several unconsolidated VIEs.  We do not consolidate these
entities because we are not the primary beneficiary and the nature of our
involvement in the activities of these entities does not give us power over
decisions that significantly affect these entities  economic performance.  We
account for our investment in these entities under the equity method (see Note
7      Investments in Partially Owned Entities   ).  As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the net carrying amounts of our investment in these
entities were $402,592,000 and $379,939,000, respectively, and our maximum
exposure to loss in these entities, is limited to our investments.   

We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1,
2016 which resulted in the identification of several VIEs which, prior to the
adoption of ASU 2015-02, were consolidated under the voting interest model. 
Our most significant consolidated VIEs are our real estate fund investments and
certain properties that have non-controlling interests.  These entities are
VIEs because the non-controlling interests do not have substantive kick-out or
participating rights.  We consolidate these entities because we control all
significant business activities.  As of September 30, 2016, the total assets
and liabilities of these consolidated VIEs are $3,974,285,000 and
$2,497,688,000, respectively.

15.    Fair Value Measurements    

   ASC 820 defines fair value and
establishes a framework for measuring fair value.  The objective of fair value
is to determine the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (the exit price).        ASC 820
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable
inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1   quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
assets or liabilities; Level 2   observable prices that are based on inputs not
quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3  
unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the
lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.   In
determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use
of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent
possible, as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair
value.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret Level 2 and 3 inputs in
determining the fair value of our financial and non-financial assets and
liabilities.  Accordingly, our fair value estimates, which are made at the end
of each reporting period, may be different than the amounts that may ultimately
be realized upon sale or disposition of these assets.       

Financial Assets and Liabilities
Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    

Financial assets and liabilities that
are measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets consist of (i)
marketable securities, (ii) real estate fund investments, (iii) the assets in
our deferred compensation plan (for which there is a corresponding liability on
our consolidated balance sheet), (iv) mandatorily redeemable instruments
(Series G-1 through G-4 convertible preferred units and Series D-13 cumulative
redeemable preferred units), and (v) interest rate swaps.       
  The tables below aggregate the fair
values of these financial assets and liabilities by their levels in the fair
value hierarchy as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Real Estate Fund Investments    

At September 30, 2016, we had six real estate fund
investments with an aggregate fair value of $519,386,000, or $210,451,000 in
excess of cost.  These investments are classified as Level 3.  We use a
discounted cash flow valuation technique to estimate the fair value of each of
these investments, which is updated quarterly by personnel responsible for the
management of each investment and reviewed by senior management at each
reporting period.  The discounted cash flow valuation technique requires us to
estimate cash flows for each investment over the anticipated holding period,
which currently ranges from 1.0 to 4.3 years.  Cash flows are derived from
property rental revenue (base rents plus reimbursements) less operating
expenses, real estate taxes and capital and other costs, plus projected sales
proceeds in the year of exit.  Property rental revenue is based on leases
currently in place and our estimates for future leasing activity, which are
based on current market rents for similar space plus a projected growth
factor.  Similarly, estimated operating expenses and real estate taxes are
based on amounts incurred in the current period plus a projected growth factor
for future periods.  Anticipated sales proceeds at the end of an investment s
expected holding period are determined based on the net cash flow of the
investment in the year of exit, divided by a terminal capitalization rate, less
estimated selling costs.     

The fair value of each property is calculated by
discounting the future cash flows (including the projected sales proceeds),
using an appropriate discount rate and then reduced by the property s
outstanding debt, if any, to determine the fair value of the equity in each
investment. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs used in determining
the fair value of each investment include capitalization rates and discount
rates.  These rates are based on the location, type and nature of each
property, and current and anticipated market conditions, industry publications
and from the experience of our Acquisitions and Capital Markets departments.    Significant unobservable quantitative
inputs in the table below were utilized in determining the fair value of these
real estate fund investments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.       

The above
inputs are subject to change based on changes in economic and market conditions
and/or changes in use or timing of exit.  Changes in discount rates and
terminal capitalization rates result in increases or decreases in the fair
values of these investments.  The discount rates encompass, among other things,
uncertainties in the valuation models with respect to terminal capitalization
rates and the amount and timing of cash flows.  Therefore, a change in the fair
value of these investments resulting from a change in the terminal
capitalization rate, may be partially offset by a change in the discount rate. 
It is not possible for us to predict the effect of future economic or market
conditions on our estimated fair values.     

The table
below summarizes the changes in the fair value of real estate fund investments
that are classified as Level 3, for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.

Deferred Compensation Plan Assets    

Deferred compensation plan assets that are classified as
Level 3 consist of investments in limited partnerships and investment funds,
which are managed by third parties.  We receive quarterly financial reports
from a third-party administrator, which are compiled from the quarterly reports
provided to them from each limited partnership and investment fund.  The
quarterly reports provide net asset values on a fair value basis which are
audited by independent public accounting firms on an annual basis.  The
third-party administrator does not adjust these values in determining our share
of the net assets and we do not adjust these values when reported in our
consolidated financial statements.

Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value     

Financial assets and liabilities that
are not measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash
equivalents (primarily money market funds, which invest in obligations of the
United States government), and our secured and unsecured debt.  Estimates of
the fair value of these instruments are determined by the standard practice of
modeling the contractual cash flows required under the instrument and
discounting them back to their present value at the appropriate current risk
adjusted interest rate, which is provided by a third-party specialist.  For
floating rate debt, we use forward rates derived from observable market yield
curves to project the expected cash flows we would be required to make under
the instrument.  The fair value of cash equivalents and borrowings under our
unsecured revolving credit facilities and unsecured term loan are classified as
Level 1.  The fair value of our secured and unsecured debt is classified as
Level 2.          The table

acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government
with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible
of $2,400,000 per occurrence and 16% of the balance of a covered loss and the
Federal government is responsible for the remaining 84% of a covered loss. We
are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.    

We continue to monitor
the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts
of terrorism.  However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on
commercially reasonable terms in the future.   

Our debt instruments,
consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non-recourse
to us, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary
covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have
adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be
able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the
future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to
obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and
expand our portfolio.   

Other
Commitments and Contingencies    

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising
in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with
legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying
degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental
assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However,
there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of
contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the
discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not
result in significant costs to us.   

Generally, our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us. 
However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant
space.  These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the
satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. 
As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and
master leases is approximately $811,000,000.   

At September 30, 2016, $38,882,000 of letters of credit
were outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities.  Our
unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require
us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market
capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a
decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit
facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including
representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default
that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure
to pay interest or principal.   

As of September 30, 2016, we expect to fund additional
capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately
$66,000,000.   

As of September 30, 2016, we have construction commitments
aggregating approximately $687,000,000.

On October 31, 2016,       Vornado s Board of Trustees approved the tax-free spin-off of our
Washington, DC business and we entered into a definitive agreement to merge it
with the business and certain select assets of The JBG Companies ( JBG ), a
Washington, DC real estate company      .  Steven Roth, Vornado s Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, will be Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the new combined
company.  Mitchell Schear, President of our Washington, DC business, will be a
member of management s Executive Committee and a Trustee of the new combined
company.     

The pro rata distribution to Vornado s
common shareholders and our common unitholders is intended to be treated as a
tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected to be
made on a pro rata 1:2 basis.     

The initial Form 10 registration statement
relating to the spin-off is expected to be filed with the SEC in the fourth
quarter of 2016, and the distribution and combination are expected to be
completed in the second quarter of 2017. The transactions are subject to
certain conditions, including the SEC declaring the Form 10 registration
statement effective, filing and approval of the new company s listing
application, receipt of regulatory approvals and third party consents by each
of Vornado and JBG, and formal declaration of the distribution by Vornado s
Board of Trustees. The transactions are not subject to a vote by Vornado
shareholders or our unitholders. Vornado s Board of Trustees has approved the
transaction.  JBG s investors have consented to the transaction.  There can be
no assurance that this transaction will be completed.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    

Partners and the Board of Trustees of Vornado Realty Trust   

   Vornado Realty L.P.   

   New York, New York   

We have reviewed the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet of Vornado Realty L.P. and consolidated subsidiaries
(the  Partnership ) as of September 30, 2016, and the related consolidated
statements of income and comprehensive income for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and changes in equity and cash flows
for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  These interim
financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management.   

We conducted our reviews in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).  A review of interim financial information consists principally of
applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit
conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an
opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.  Accordingly, we
do not express such an opinion.   

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of
any material modifications that should be made to such consolidated interim
financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.   

We have previously audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheet of Vornado Realty L.P. as of December
31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not
presented herein); and in our report dated February 22, 2016, we expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and included an
explanatory paragraph regarding the Partnership s adoption of Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-08,    Reporting Discontinued Operations and
Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity   .  In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to
the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Item 2.
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations    

Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report
constitute forward looking statements as such term is defined in
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They represent
our intentions, plans, expectations and beliefs and are subject to numerous
assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Our future results, financial condition
and business may differ materially from those expressed in these
forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking
for words such as  approximates,   believes,   expects,   anticipates, 
 estimates,   intends,   plans,   would,   may  or other similar expressions in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q.  We also note the following
forward-looking statements: in the case of our development and redevelopment
projects, the estimated completion date, estimated project cost and cost to
complete; and estimates of future capital expenditures, and operating
partnership distributions.  Many of the factors that will determine the outcome
of these and our other forward-looking statements are beyond our ability to
control or predict. For further discussion of factors that could materially
affect the outcome of our forward-looking statements, see  Item 1A. Risk
Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December
31, 2015.  For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for
forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q or the date of any document incorporated by reference.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us
or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not
undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after
the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
includes a discussion of our consolidated financial statements for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results for the full year.  Certain prior year
balances have been reclassified in order to conform to current year
presentation.

Overview    

Business
Objective and Operating Strategy     

   Our business objective is to
maximize Vornado shareholder value, which we measure by the total return
provided to Vornado s shareholders. Below is a table comparing Vornado s
performance to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index ( Office REIT ) and the MSCI US
REIT Index ( MSCI ) for the following periods ended September 30, 2016:   

We intend to achieve our business objective by continuing
to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies
through:   

Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment
professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit   

                   Investing
in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe
there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation    

                   Acquiring
quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a
significant potential for higher rents   

                   Investing
in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City
metropolitan area   

                   Developing
and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value   

                   Investing
in operating companies that have a significant real estate component   

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and
investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by
accessing the public and private capital markets.  We may also offer partnership
units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these units
or any other securities of ours in the future.   

We compete with a large number of real estate property
owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on
their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales
prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth
and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other
factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the
financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants
and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation
costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment
trends.  See  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as
amended, for the year ended December 31, 2015, for additional information
regarding these factors.   

On October 31,
2016, Vornado s Board of Trustees approved the tax-free spin-off of our Washington,
DC business and we entered into a definitive agreement to merge it with the
business and certain select assets of The JBG Companies ( JBG ), a Washington,
DC real estate company.  See Note 23      Subsequent Event    in our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding this
transaction.

2016 Investments    

On March 17, 2016, we entered into a joint venture, in
which we own a 33.3% interest, which owns a $146,004,000 mezzanine loan.  The
interest rate is LIBOR plus 8.875% (9.38% at September 30, 2016) and the debt
matures in November 2016, with two three-month extension options.  At September
30, 2016, the joint venture has a $3,996,000 remaining commitment, of which our
share is $1,332,000.  The joint venture s investment is subordinate to $350,000,000
of third party debt.  We account for our investment in the joint venture under
the equity method.       

On May 20, 2016, we contributed
$19,650,000 for a 50.0% equity interest in a joint venture that will develop
606 Broadway, a 33,000 square foot office and retail building, located on
Houston Street in Manhattan.  The development cost of this project is estimated
to be approximately $104,000,000.  At closing, the joint venture obtained a
$65,000,000 construction loan, of which approximately $22,500,000 was
outstanding at September 30, 2016.  The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR
plus 3.00% (3.52% at September 30, 2016), matures in May 2019 with two one-year
extension options.  Because this joint venture is a VIE and we determined we
are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the accounts of this joint venture
from the date of our investment.     

2016 Dispositions    

On May 27, 2016, we sold a 47% ownership interest in 7 West
34th Street, a 477,000 square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon,
and retained the remaining 53% interest.  This transaction was based on a
property value of approximately $561,000,000 or $1,176 per square foot.  We
received net proceeds of $127,382,000 from the sale and realized a net gain of
$203,324,000, of which $159,511,000 was recognized in the second quarter and is
included in  net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned
assets  in our consolidated statements of income.  The remaining net gain of
$43,813,000 has been deferred until our guarantee of payment of loan principal
and interest is removed or the loan is repaid.  We realized a net tax gain of
$90,017,000.   We continue to manage and lease the property.  We share control
over major decisions with our joint venture partner.  Accordingly, this
property is accounted for under the equity method from the date of sale.

2016 Financings    

Secured Debt    

On
February 8, 2016, we completed a $700,000,000 refinancing of 770 Broadway, a
1,158,000 square foot Manhattan office building.  The five-year loan is
interest only at LIBOR plus 1.75%, (2.28% at September 30, 2016) which was
swapped for four and a half years to a fixed rate of 2.56%.  The Company
realized net proceeds of approximately $330,000,000.  The property was
previously encumbered by a 5.65%, $353,000,000 mortgage which was scheduled to
mature in March 2016.       

On March 7, 2016, the joint venture, in which we have a 55%
ownership interest, completed a $300,000,000 refinancing of One Park Avenue, a
947,000 square foot Manhattan office building.  The loan matures in March
2021 and is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.75% (2.28% at September 30, 2016). 
The property was previously encumbered by a 4.995%, $250,000,000 mortgage which
matured in March 2016.       

On May 6, 2016, the joint
venture, in which we have a 55% ownership interest, completed a $273,000,000
refinancing of The Warner Building, a 621,000 square foot Washington, DC office
building.  The loan matures in June 2023, has a fixed rate of 3.65%, is
interest only for the first two years and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule
beginning in year three. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.26%,
$293,000,000 mortgage which matured in May 2016.     

On May 11, 2016, the joint
venture, in which we have a 50% ownership interest, completed a $900,000,000
refinancing of 280 Park Avenue, a 1,250,000 square foot Manhattan office
building.  The three-year loan with four one-year extensions is interest only
at LIBOR plus 2.00% (2.51% at September 30, 2016).  The property was previously
encumbered by a 6.35%, $721,000,000 mortgage which was scheduled to mature in
June 2016.     

On May 16, 2016, we completed a $300,000,000 recourse
financing of 7 West 34th Street.  The ten-year loan is interest only at a fixed
rate of 3.65% and matures in June 2026.   

On August 3, 2016, the joint
venture, in which we have 49.9% ownership interest, completed an $80,000,000
refinancing of 50-70 West 93rd Street, a 326 unit Manhattan residential
complex.  The three-year loan with two one-year extensions is interest only at
LIBOR plus 1.70% (2.22% at September 30, 2016).  The property was previously
encumbered by a $44,980,000 first mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.90% and an
$18,481,000 second mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.65%, which were scheduled to mature
in September 2016.     

On September 6, 2016, we
completed a $675,000,000 refinancing of theMART, a 3,644,000 square foot
commercial building in Chicago.  The five-year loan is interest only and has a
fixed rate of 2.70%.  The Company realized net proceeds of approximately
$124,000,000.  The property was previously encumbered by a 5.57%, $550,000,000
mortgage which was scheduled to mature in December 2016.     

Preferred Securities    

On September 1, 2016, we redeemed all of the outstanding 6.875%
Series J cumulative redeemable preferred units at their redemption price of
$25.00 per unit, or $246,250,000 in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid distributions
through the date of redemption.  In connection therewith, we expensed
$7,408,000 of issuance costs, which reduced net income attributable to Class A
unitholders in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  These costs had been
initially recorded as a reduction of partners  capital.

Recently Issued Accounting Literature    

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board       (     FASB ) issued
an update ( ASU 2014-09 ) establishing Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) Topic 606,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers    ( ASC
606 ).  ASU 2014-09 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to
use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and
supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance.  ASU 2014-09
requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also
requires certain additional disclosures.  In August 2015, the FASB issued an
update ( ASU 2015-14 ) to ASC 606,    Deferral of the Effective Date   , which
defers the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to interim and annual reporting periods in
fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2017.  In March 2016, the FASB
issued an update ( ASU 2016-08 ) to ASC 606,    Principal versus Agent
Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   , which clarifies the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new
revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09.  In April 2016, the FASB
issued an update ( ASU 2016-10 ) to ASC 606,    Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing   , which clarifies guidance related to identifying
performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in ASU
2014-09.  In May 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-12 ) to ASC 606,    Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients   , which amends certain aspects of the
new revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09.  We are currently
evaluating the impact of the adoption of these ASUs on our consolidated
financial statements.        

In June 2014, the FASB issued an
update ( ASU 2014-12 ) to ASC Topic 718,    Compensation   Stock Compensation    ( ASC
718 ).  ASU 2014-12 requires an entity to treat performance targets that can be
met after the requisite service period of a share based award has ended, as a
performance condition that affects vesting.  ASU 2014-12 is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that began after December
15, 2015.  The adoption of this update as of January 1, 2016, did not have any
impact on our consolidated financial statements.           

In
February 2015, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2015-02 )    Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis    to ASC Topic 810,    Consolidation   .  ASU 2015-02
affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should
consolidate certain legal entities.  Specifically, the amendments: (i) modify
the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are
variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities, (ii)
eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited
partnership, (iii) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that
are involved with VIEs, and (iv) provide a scope exception for certain
entities.  ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this update on January 1,
2016 resulted in the identification of additional VIEs, but did not have an
impact on our consolidated financial statements other than additional
disclosures   .         

In January 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-01 )    Recognition
and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities    to ASC Topic
825,    Financial Instruments   .  ASU 2016-01 amends certain aspects of
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments,
including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value
with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  ASU 2016-01 is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements.

Overview   continued    

Recently Issued Accounting Literature   continued    

In February 2016, the FASB issued ( ASU 2016-02 )    Leases   ,
which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation
and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors.  ASU 2016-02 requires
lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or
operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively
a financed purchase.  Lessees are required to record a right-of-use asset
and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months.
Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to
existing guidance for operating leases.  Lessees will recognize expense based
on the effective interest method for finance leases or on a straight-line basis
for operating leases.  The new standard requires lessors to account for leases
using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance.  ASU
2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018,
with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.           

In March 2016, the FASB issued an
update ( ASU 2016-09 )    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting    to ASC 718.  ASU 2016-09 amends several aspects of the
accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU
2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.       

In
August 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-15 )    Classification of
Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    to ASC Topic 230,    Statement
of Cash Flows   . ASU 2016-15 clarifies guidance on the classification of
certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows to reduce
diversity in practice with respect to (i) debt prepayment or debt
extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other
debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation
to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (iii) contingent consideration
payments made after a business combination, (iv) proceeds from the settlement
of insurance claims, (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life
insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (vi)
distributions received from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interests
in securitization transactions, and (viii) separately identifiable cash
flows and application of the predominance principle.  ASU 2016-15 is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of this
update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements.                

Critical Accounting Policies    

A
summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on

Leasing Activity    

The leasing activity and related
statistics in the table below are based on leases signed during the period and are
not intended to coincide with the commencement of rental revenue in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ).  Second generation relet space represents square footage that has not
been vacant for more than nine months and tenant improvements and leasing
commissions are based on our share of square feet leased during the period.

Washington, DC Segment   

EBITDA, as
adjusted for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $5,050,000 behind the
prior year's nine months.  We expect that Washington s 2016 EBITDA, as
adjusted, will be approximately $7,000,000 to $11,000,000 lower than 2015,
comprised of:   

(i)             
  core business being flat to $4,000,000 higher, offset by,    

  (ii)           
  occupancy of Skyline properties declining further, decreasing EBITDA by
approximately $6,500,000, and   

  (iii)          
  1726 M Street and 1150 17th Street being taken out of service (to
prepare for the development in the future of a new Class A office building)
decreasing EBITDA by approximately $4,500,000.  

Of the 2,395,000
square feet subject to the effects of the Base Realignment and Closure ( BRAC )
statute, 348,000 square feet has been taken out of service for redevelopment,
and 1,466,000 square feet has been leased or is pending.  The table below

   Below are the components of the income from our real estate
fund investments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

Interest and Other Investment Income, net    

Interest and other investment income,
net was $6,508,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$3,160,000 in the prior year s quarter, an increase of $3,348,000. This increase
resulted primarily from an increase in the value of investments in our deferred
compensation plan (offset by a corresponding decrease in the liability for plan
assets in general and administrative expenses).   

Interest and Debt Expense    

Interest and debt expense was
$98,365,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$95,344,000 in the prior year s quarter, an increase of $3,021,000.  This
increase was primarily due to (i) $5,417,000 of higher interest expense from
the financings of the St. Regis - retail, 150 West 34th Street, 100 West 33rd
Street,     and our $750,000,000 delayed draw term
loan,     (ii) $2,632,000     of accrued default interest on our Skyline properties
mortgage loan,     and (iii) $2,621,000 of lower
capitalized interest,     partially offset by (iv)
$4,894,000 of interest savings from the financings of 888 Seventh Avenue and
770 Broadway, and (v) $1,804,000 of interest savings from the repayment of the
Bowen Building loan.

Net Gain
on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets    

   For the three months ended September 30,
2015, we recognized a $103,037,000 net gain on disposition of wholly owned and
partially owned assets primarily from the sale of 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue.     

Income Tax Expense    

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, income tax
expense was $4,865,000, compared to $2,856,000 for the prior year s quarter, an
increase of $2,009,000.  This increase was primarily attributable to higher
income from our taxable REIT subsidiaries.   

Income from Discontinued Operations    

We have reclassified the revenues and expenses of the UE
portfolio and other retail properties that were sold or are currently held for
sale to  income from discontinued operations  and the related assets and
liabilities to  assets related to discontinued operations  and  liabilities
related to discontinued operations  for all the periods presented in the
accompanying financial statements.      The table below sets forth the combined results of assets related to
discontinued operations for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015.    

Net Income
Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries    

Net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries was     $3,658,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2016, compared to $3,302,000 for the prior year s quarter, an increase of
$356,000.   

Preferred Unit Distributions    

   Preferred unit distributions were $19,096,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $20,412,000 for the prior year s
quarter, a decrease of $1,316,000.  The decrease is primarily due to the
redemption of the 6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable preferred units on
September 1, 2016.     

Preferred Unit Issuance Costs    

   In the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized
a $7,408,000 expense in connection with the write-off of issuance costs upon
the redemption all of the outstanding 6.875% Series J cumulative redeemable
preferred units on September 1, 2016.

Same Store EBITDA    

   Same store EBITDA represents EBITDA from
property level operations which are owned by us in both the current and prior
year reporting periods.  Same store EBITDA excludes segment-level overhead
expenses, which are expenses that we do not consider to be property-level
expenses, as well as other non-operating items.  We also present same store
EBITDA on a cash basis which excludes income from the straight-lining of rents,
amortization of below-market leases, net of above-market leases and other
non-cash adjustments. We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate
meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and
segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties,
and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of
our peers.  Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net
income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures employed by other companies.

Notes to preceding tabular information:   

New York:   

(1)            The $12,998,000

Office and Retail EBITDA of $9,916,000 and $6,098,000, respectively, partially
offset by a decrease in Hotel Pennsylvania EBITDA of $3,659,000.  The Office
and Retail EBITDA increases resulted primarily from higher rents, partially
offset by higher operating expenses, net of reimbursements.  

(2)            Excluding
Hotel Pennsylvania, same store EBITDA increased by 6.5%.  

Washington, DC:   

(3)            The

the financings of the St. Regis - retail, 150 West 34th Street, 100 West 33rd
Street,     and our $750,000,000 delayed draw term

Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned
Assets    

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we recognized a $160,225,000 net gain on disposition of wholly owned and
partially owned assets, primarily from the sale of a 47% ownership interest in
7 West 34th Street, compared to $104,897,000 for the prior year s nine months,
primarily from the sale of 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue.    

Income Tax (Expense) Benefit    

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income
tax expense was $9,805,000, compared to an income tax benefit of $84,245,000 for
the prior year s nine months, an increase in expense of  $94,050,000.  This
increase in expense resulted primarily from the prior year reversal of
$90,030,000 of valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets,
as we have concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that we will generate
sufficient taxable income from the sale of 220 Central Park South residential
condominium units to realize the deferred tax assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

Property
rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the
occupancy and rental rates of our properties.   Our cash requirements include
property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing
commissions, distributions to unitholders, as well as acquisition and
development costs.  Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements
include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior
unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit facilities, proceeds from the
issuance of equity securities, and asset sales.       

We
anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve
months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to
unitholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures.  Capital
requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions may require funding
from borrowings and/or equity offerings.   

We
may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities or redeem
our equity securities.  Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing
market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors.  The amounts
involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our
consolidated financial statements.   

Skyline Properties    

In
the first quarter of 2016, we notified the servicer of the $678,000,000 non-recourse
mortgage loan on the Skyline properties in Virginia that cash flow will be
insufficient to service the debt and pay other property related costs and
expenses and that we were not willing to fund additional cash shortfalls. 
Accordingly, at our request, the loan has been transferred to the special
servicer.  In the second quarter of 2016, cash flow became insufficient to
service the debt and we ceased making debt service payments.  Pursuant to the
loan agreement, the loan is in default, causing the loan to be immediately due
and payable, and is subject to incremental default interest  which increased
the weighted average interest rate from 2.97% to 4.51% while the outstanding
balance remains unpaid.  This loan is recourse only to the Skyline properties. 
Accordingly, this default has not had, nor is expected to have, any material
impact on our current or future business operations, our ability to raise
capital or our credit ratings.  For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, we accrued $2,632,000 and $5,343,000 of default interest expense,
respectively.  We continue to negotiate with the special servicer. There can be
no assurance as to the timing or ultimate resolution of this matter.

Capital
Expenditures for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016    

Capital expenditures consist of
expenditures to maintain assets, tenant improvement allowances and leasing
commissions.  Recurring capital expenditures include expenditures to maintain a
property s competitive position within the market and tenant improvements and
leasing commissions necessary to re-lease expiring leases or renew or extend
existing leases.  Non-recurring capital improvements include expenditures to
lease space that has been vacant for more than nine months and expenditures
completed in the year of acquisition and the following two years that were
planned at the time of acquisition, as well as tenant improvements and leasing
commissions for space that was vacant at the time of acquisition of a property.   

Below is a summary
of capital expenditures, leasing commissions and a reconciliation of total
expenditures on an accrual basis to the cash expended in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.   

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures for the Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016    

Development and redevelopment
expenditures consist of all hard and soft costs associated with the development
or redevelopment of a property, including capitalized interest, debt and
operating costs until the property is substantially completed and ready for its
intended use.  Our development project budgets below include initial leasing
costs, which are reflected as non-recurring capital expenditures in the table
above.      

We are constructing a residential condominium tower containing
397,000 salable square feet on our 220 Central Park South development site. 
The incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately
$1.3 billion, of which $534,920,000 has been expended as of September 30, 2016.   

We are developing The Bartlett, a 699-unit residential
project in Pentagon City, which is expected to be completed in 2016.  The
project will include a 40,000 square foot Whole Foods Market at the base of the
building.  The incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be
approximately $250,000,000, of which $219,153,000 has been expended as of
September 30, 2016.    

We are developing a 173,000 square foot Class-A office
building, located along the western edge of the High Line at 512 West 22nd
Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan (55.0% owned).  The
incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately
$130,000,000, of which our share is $72,000,000.  As of     September 30, 2016    , $24,284,000
has been expended, of which our share is $13,356,000.   

We are developing 61 Ninth Avenue, located on the Southwest
corner of Ninth Avenue and 15th Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan. 
In February 2016, the venture purchased an adjacent five story loft building
and air rights in exchange for a 10% common and preferred equity interest in
the venture valued at $19,400,000, which reduced our ownership interest to
45.1% from 50.1%.  The venture s current plans are to construct an office
building, with retail at the base, of approximately 167,000 square feet.  The
incremental development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately
$150,000,000, of which our share is $68,000,000.  As of     September 30, 2016    ,
$26,169,000 has been expended, of which our share is $11,802,000.

We plan to demolish two adjacent
Washington, DC office properties, 1726 M Street and 1150 17th Street in 2016
and replace them in the future with a new 335,000 square foot Class A office
building, to be addressed 1700 M Street.  The incremental development cost of
the project is estimated to be approximately $170,000,000.   

We are also evaluating other
development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in
Manhattan, including the Penn Plaza District, and in Washington, including
Crystal City, Rosslyn and Pentagon City.    

There can be no assurance that any of our development or
redevelopment projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed, or
completed on schedule or within budget.    

Below is a summary of development
and redevelopment expenditures incurred in the nine months ended September 30,
2016.  These expenditures include interest of $24,822,000, payroll of
$9,475,000 and other soft costs (primarily architectural and engineering fees,
permits, real estate taxes and professional fees) aggregating $45,316,000, that

Cash Flows
for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Our cash and cash equivalents were $788,137,000 at
September 30, 2015, a $410,340,000 decrease over the balance at December 31,
2014.  The decrease is primarily due to cash flows from investing and financing
activities, partially offset by cash flows from operating activities, as
discussed below.   

Cash flows provided by operating activities of $443,525,000
was comprised of (i) net income of $575,886,000, (ii) return of capital from
real estate fund investments of $91,036,000, (iii) distributions of income from
partially owned entities of $51,650,000, and (iv) $10,350,000 of non-cash
adjustments, which include depreciation and amortization expense, the reversal
of allowance for deferred tax assets, the effect of straight-lining of rental
income, equity in net loss from partially owned entities, real estate
impairment losses, and net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially
owned assets, partially offset by (v) the net change in operating assets and
liabilities of $285,397,000 (including the acquisition of real estate fund
investments of $95,010,000).   

Net cash used in investing activities of $480,383,000 was

$207,845,000 of additions to real estate, (iv) $144,890,000 of investments in
partially owned entities, and (v) $25,845,000 of investments in loans

restricted cash, (viii) $31,822,000 of capital distributions from partially
owned entities, and (ix) $16,781,000 of proceeds from sales and repayments of
mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable and other.   

Net cash used in financing activities of $373,482,000 was

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures for the Nine

Below
is a summary of development and redevelopment expenditures incurred in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  These expenditures include interest of $48,817,000,
payroll of $3,557,000, and other soft costs (primarily architectural and

Other
Commitments and Contingencies    

We are from time to time involved in
legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after
consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.   

Each
of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental
assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any
material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that
the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or
known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in
cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.   

Generally,
our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us.  However, in certain cases we have
provided guarantees or master leased tenant space.  These guarantees and master
leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or
repayment of the underlying loans.  As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate
dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately   $811,000,000  .   

At
September 30, 2016, $38,882,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one
of our unsecured revolving credit facilities.  Our unsecured revolving credit
facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum
interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide
for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below
Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions
precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also
contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated
repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.   

As
of September 30, 2016, we expect to fund additional capital to certain of our
partially owned entities aggregating approximately $66,000,000.   

As of September 30,
2016, we have construction commitments aggregating approximately $687,000,000.   

73   

Item 3.         Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

   We have exposure to fluctuations in
market interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that
are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our
consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading
activity) is as follows:   

We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate
the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings,
including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate
environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of September 30,
2016, we have an interest rate swap on a $414,000,000 mortgage loan on Two Penn
Plaza that swapped the rate from LIBOR plus 1.65% (2.17% at September 30, 2016)
to a fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018 and an interest swap on a
$375,000,000 mortgage loan on 888 Seventh Avenue that swapped the rate from
LIBOR plus 1.60% (2.12% at September 30, 2016) to a fixed rate of 3.15% through
December 2020.   

In connection with the $700,000,000 refinancing of 770
Broadway, we entered into an interest rate swap from LIBOR plus 1.75% (2.28% at
September 30, 2016) to a fixed rate of 2.56% through September 2020.   

Fair Value of Debt    

The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt is
calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the
current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt.  As of September 30, 2016,
the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $10,758,000,000.   

Item 4.   Controls
and Procedures    

   Disclosure
Controls and Procedures:  Vornado s management, with the participation of
Vornado s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated
the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such
term is defined in Rule 13a 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
on such evaluation, Vornado s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, such disclosure controls
and procedures were effective.

Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal
control over financial reporting.
