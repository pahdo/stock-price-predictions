1. Organization and Business

The Blended Strategies Portfolio (the  Fund ) is a series of Graham Alternative Investment Fund I LLC ( GAIF I ), a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company established through an amendment to the certificate of formation, effective March 28, 2013. Prior to March 28, 2013, GAIF I was organized as a Delaware Limited Liability Company which was formed on May 16, 2006 and commenced operations on August 1, 2006. GAIF I has one other active series in addition to the Fund, the Systematic Strategies Portfolio. GAIF I is registered as a commodity pool and as such is subject to the oversight and jurisdiction of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ).

As a Series Limited Liability Company each series is legally segregated, and the assets associated with each series are held separately and accounted for in separate and distinct records from the assets of any other series of GAIF I. The debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular series are enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of GAIF I generally or any other series thereof. Further, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to GAIF I are enforceable against the assets of any other series.

The Fund offers investors Class 0 and Class 2 units. The Fund invests all of its assets dedicated to trading in Graham Alternative Investment Trading LLC ( GAIT ), a Delaware Limited Liability Company which was formed on May 18, 2006 and commenced operations on August 1, 2006. GAIT invests in various master trading vehicles ( Master Funds ) and Graham Cash Assets LLC ( Cash Assets ), all of which are managed by Graham Capital Management, L.P. (the  Advisor  or  Manager ). The Manager is the manager and the sole investment advisor of GAIT and the Fund. The Manager is registered as a Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor with the U.S. CFTC and is a member of the National Futures Association. The Manager is also registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser. The Fund s Units are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The investment objective of the Fund is to achieve long-term capital appreciation through professionally managed trading in both U.S. and foreign markets primarily in futures contracts, forwards contracts, spot currency contracts, and associated derivative instruments, such as options and swaps, through its investment in GAIT, which in turn invests in various Master Funds. The Master Funds seek to profit from opportunities in the global financial markets, including interest rate futures, foreign exchange, global stock indices and energy, metals and agricultural futures, as professionally managed multi-strategy investment vehicles. Each of the investment programs consists of multiple trading strategies of the Manager, which the Manager has combined in an effort to diversify the Fund s investment exposure and to make the Fund s performance returns less volatile and more consistently profitable.

SEI Global Services, Inc. ( SEI ) is the Fund s independent administrator and transfer agent. SEI is responsible for certain matters pertaining to the administration of the Fund.

The Fund will terminate on December 31, 2050 or at an earlier date if certain conditions occur as outlined in the Limited Liability Company Agreement ( LLC Agreement ).

The performance of the Fund is directly affected by the performance of GAIT; therefore these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the attached financial statements of GAIT.

Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements (continued)

1. Organization and Business (continued)

Duties of the Manager

Subject to the terms and conditions of the LLC Agreement, the Manager has complete and exclusive responsibility for managing and administering the affairs of the Fund and for directing the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Fund and GAIT.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and all amounts are stated in U.S. dollars. The Fund applies specialized accounting guidance as outlined in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946,  Financial Services   Investment Companies,  and is an investment company within the meaning of such guidance. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investment in Graham Alternative Investment Trading LLC

The Fund records its investment in GAIT at fair value based upon the Fund s proportionate share of GAIT s reported net asset value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In determining its net asset value, GAIT records its investments in Master Funds at fair value based upon GAIT s proportionate share of the Master Funds  reported net asset value. The Fund records its proportionate share of GAIT s investment income and loss, expenses, fees, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on a monthly basis and includes them in the statements of operations. Purchases and sales of units in GAIT are recorded on a trade date basis. The accounting policies of GAIT are described in its attached financial statements.

GAIT charges its investors, including the Fund, an advisory fee, sponsor fee, and incentive allocation, all of which are described in detail in Note 4. The Fund does not charge any additional fees; however each investor in the Fund indirectly bears a portion of the advisory fee, sponsor fee, and incentive allocation charged by GAIT.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Fund owned 56.72% and 52.56%, respectively of GAIT.

Fair Value

The fair value of the assets and liabilities of the Fund and GAIT, which qualify as financial instruments under U.S. GAAP, approximates the carrying amounts presented in the statements of financial condition. Changes in these carrying amounts are included in the statements of operations.

The Fund follows U.S. GAAP for fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. The Fund reports the fair value of its investment related assets and liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy established under U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP uses a three level hierarchy for fair value measurement based on the activeness of the market and the transparency and independence of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.

Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements (continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Fair Value (continued)

The fair value hierarchy categorizes asset and liability positions into one of three levels, as summarized below, based on the inputs and assumptions used in deriving fair value.

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted closing or settlement prices for such assets or liabilities as published by the primary exchange upon which they are traded.

Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities obtained from independent brokers and/or market makers in each security.

Level 3 inputs are those which are considered unobservable and are significant in arriving at fair value.

The Fund s investment in GAIT has been valued at net asset value using the practical expedient. According to FASB Accounting Standards Update 2015-07    Disclosures for Investment in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)  ( ASU 2015-07 ), these investments are no longer categorized in the fair value hierarchy. There were no Level 3 assets or liabilities held at any point during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015 by the Fund, GAIT, or the Master Funds and there were no transfers between levels during those periods. Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that cause the transfer.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15    Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern  (Subtopic 205-40). The pronouncement determines management s responsibility regarding the assessment of the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern even if the Fund s liquidation is not imminent. Under this guidance, during each period in which financial statements are prepared, management will need to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Substantial doubt would exist if conditions or events indicate that the Fund will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due.   Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, however early adoption is permitted. The Manager is currently assessing the impact, if any, that this pronouncement will have on the disclosures within the financial statements which is expected to be minimal.

Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, the Master Funds, GAIT, Cash Assets, and the Fund enter into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. Such contracts may include those by Cash Assets and the Master Funds with their brokers and trading counterparties. The Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown; however, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses with respect to such indemnifications and considers the risk of loss to be remote. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no accruals have been recorded by the Fund for indemnifications.

3. Capital Accounts

The Fund offers two classes (each a  Class ) of Units (collectively the  Units ), being Class 0 Units and Class 2 Units. The Fund may issue additional Classes in the future subject to different fees, expenses or other terms, or to invest in other investment programs or combinations of investment programs managed by the Manager.

A separate capital account is maintained for each member with respect to each member s Class of Units. The initial balance of each member s capital account is equal to the initial contribution to the Fund by such member with respect to the Class to which such capital account relates. Each member s capital account is increased by any additional subscription, and decreased by any redemption by such member of Units of such Class to which the capital account relates. All income and expenses of the Fund are allocated among the members  capital accounts in proportion to the balance that each capital account bears to the balance of all capital as of the beginning of such fiscal period.

Subscriptions

Units may be purchased at a price equal to the Net Asset Value per Unit of the relevant Class as of the immediately preceding Valuation Day as defined in the LLC Agreement. The minimum initial subscription from each investor in each Class is $10,000. Members may subscribe for additional Units in a minimum amount of not less than $5,000.

Units are available for subscription as of the first business day of each month upon written notice of at least three business days prior to the last business day of the preceding month.

Redemption of Units

Units are not subject to any minimum holding period. Members may redeem Units at the Net Asset Value thereof as of each Valuation Day, as defined in the LLC Agreement, upon not less than three business days  prior written notice to the administrator. A partial redemption request for an amount less than $10,000 will not be accepted, nor will a redemption request be accepted to the extent that it would result in an investor owning less than $25,000. The redemption proceeds will normally be remitted within 15 days after the Valuation Day, without interest for the period from the Valuation Day to the payment date.

Redemption Fees

Class 2 Units are subject to a redemption fee equal to 2% of their Net Asset Value if redeemed within six months from their subscription date and a redemption fee equal to 1% of their Net Asset Value if redeemed more than six and less than twelve months from their subscription date. Class 0 Units are not subject to a redemption fee. Redemption fees are payable to the Manager upon redemption of Units from the proceeds of such redemption. There were $231 and $0 of redemption fees paid to the Manager for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

4. Fees and Related Party Transactions

Advisory Fees

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, each Class of GAIT other than Class M paid the Manager an advisory fee (the  Advisory Fee ) at an aggregate annual rate equal to 1.75% of the Net Asset Value of such Class. The Advisory Fee is payable monthly in arrears calculated as of the last business day of each month and any other date the Manager may permit, in its sole and absolute discretion, as of which any subscription or redemption is effected with respect to Units of such Class during the month.

Sponsor Fees

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, each Class of GAIT other than Class M paid the Manager a sponsor fee (the  Sponsor Fee ) at an annual rate of the Net Asset Value specified in the table below. The Sponsor Fee is payable monthly in arrears calculated as of the last business day of each month in the same manner as the Advisory Fee.

Incentive Allocation

At the end of each calendar quarter, Graham Capital LLC, an affiliate of the Manager, will receive a special allocation of net profits (the  Incentive Allocation ) in an amount equal to 20% of the New High Net Trading Profits of each Class of GAIT, as defined in the LLC Agreement. The Incentive Allocation is also accrued and allocable on the date of redemption with respect to any Units that are redeemed prior to the end of a calendar quarter. Additionally, any loss carryforward attributable to any class of GAIT shall be proportionately reduced, effective as of the date of any redemption of any Units of such class, by multiplying the loss carryforward by the ratio that the amount of assets redeemed from such class bears to the net assets of such class immediately prior to such redemption. The loss carryforward of a class must be recouped before any subsequent Incentive Allocation can be made. The total Incentive Allocation allocated to the Fund by GAIT for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $1,550,824, respectively.

Administrator s Fee

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, GAIT paid SEI a monthly administrator s fee based on GAIT s net asset value, calculated as of the last business day of each month. In addition, GAIT reimbursed SEI for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of GAIT. The total administrator s fees, including out-of-pocket expenses, allocated to the Fund by GAIT for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $82,004 and $97,678, respectively.

Any portion of any of the above fees, including the Incentive Allocation, may be paid by the Manager to third parties as compensation for selling activities in connection with the Fund.

5. Income Taxes

No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements, as members are individually responsible for reporting income or loss based upon their respective share of the Fund s revenues and expenses for income tax purposes.

U.S. GAAP provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. U.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year and the Fund identifies its major tax jurisdictions as U.S. Federal and Connecticut State. The Manager has evaluated the Fund s tax positions and has concluded that there are no significant tax positions requiring recognition, measurement or disclosure in the financial statements for open tax years 2013 through 2015 or expected to be taken in the Fund s 2016 tax returns. The Manager is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax expense will change materially in the next twelve months. Tax years which are considered open by the relevant jurisdiction are subject to potential examination.

6. Financial Highlights (continued)

The following represents ratios to average members  capital, excluding the Managing Member, and total return for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Total return is calculated for Class 0 and Class 2 Units taken as a whole. Total return is calculated as the change in total members  capital adjusted for subscriptions or redemptions during the period. An individual member s return may vary from these returns based on the timing of capital transactions and the applicability of Advisory Fees, Sponsor Fees, Administrator s Fees, and the Incentive Allocation. The net investment loss and total expense ratios (including Incentive Allocation) are calculated for Class 0 and Class 2 Units taken as a whole and include net amounts allocated from GAIT. The computation of such ratios is based on the amount of net investment loss, expenses and Incentive Allocation. Net investment loss and total expense ratios have not been annualized and are computed based upon the weighted average of members  capital for Class 0 and Class 2 Units of the Fund for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

7. Subsequent Events

The Fund had subscriptions of approximately $0.2 million and redemptions of approximately $0.9 million from October 1, 2016 through November 14, 2016, the date through which subsequent events were evaluated by management. These amounts have not been included in the financial statements.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and all amounts are stated in U.S. dollars. GAIT applies specialized accounting guidance as outlined in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946,  Financial Services   Investment Companies , and is an investment company within the meaning of such guidance.

Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements (continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Due from/to Brokers

Due from/to brokers on the Master Funds  and Graham Cash Assets LLC s ( Cash Assets ) financial statements primarily consist of cash balances carried as margin deposits with clearing brokers for the purpose of trading in futures contracts, foreign currency contracts and other derivative instruments and securities, and receivables/payables for unsettled transactions. Substantially all of the Master Funds  and Cash Assets  cash and investments are held as collateral by its brokers to secure derivative instruments and securities.

Revenue Recognition

All financial instruments are recorded on the trade date at fair value. Net unrealized gain or loss on open derivative instruments is included in the Master Funds  statements of financial condition as the difference between the original purchase price and the current market value at the end of the period. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the Master Funds  statements of operations. Interest income and expense are recorded on the accrual basis. Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are net of related withholding taxes. All other expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.

Brokerage Commissions and Fees

Brokerage commissions and fees on the Master Funds  financial statements represent all brokerage commissions and other fees incurred in connection with the Master Funds  trading activity and are recorded on the accrual basis.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are calculated using daily exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. The Master Funds do not isolate the portion of results of operations from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments and cash from fluctuations arising from changes in market prices held. Currency translation gains and losses are included in the statement of operations within net realized gain (loss) and net increase (decrease) in unrealized appreciation on investments.

Fair Value

The fair value of GAIT s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under U.S. GAAP, approximates the carrying amounts presented in the statements of financial condition. Changes in these carrying amounts are included in the statements of operations and incentive allocation.

GAIT follows U.S. GAAP for fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. GAIT reports the fair value of its investment related assets and liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy established under U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP uses a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement based on the activeness of the market and the transparency and independence of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.

Fair Value (continued)

The fair value hierarchy categorizes asset and liability positions into one of three levels, as summarized below, based on the inputs and assumptions used in deriving fair value.

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted closing or settlement prices for such assets or liabilities as published by the primary exchange upon which they are traded.

Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities obtained from independent brokers and/or market makers in each security.

Level 3 inputs are those which are considered unobservable and are significant in arriving at fair value.

GAIT s investments in Master Funds and Graham Cash Assets LLC ( Cash Assets ) have been valued at net asset value using the practical expedient. According to FASB Accounting Standards Update 2015-07    Disclosures for Investment in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)  ( ASU 2015-07 ), these investments are no longer categorized in the fair value hierarchy. GAIT s investments in Master Funds and Cash Assets are discussed in Notes 3 and 4. There were no Level 3 assets or liabilities held at any point during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015 by GAIT, the Master Funds, or Cash Assets, and there were no transfers between levels during those periods. Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that cause the transfer.

Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of business, the Master Funds utilize derivative financial instruments in connection with their trading activities. Derivative instruments derive their value from underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors. Investments in derivative financial instruments are subject to additional risks that can result in a loss of all or part of an investment. The Master Funds  derivative financial instruments are classified by the following primary underlying risks: interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price, and equity price risks. These risks can be in excess of the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition. In addition, the Master Funds are also subject to additional counterparty risk should their counterparties fail to meet the terms of their contracts. Management of counterparty risk involves a number of considerations, such as the financial profile of the counterparty, specific terms and duration of the contractual agreement, and the value of collateral held, if any. The Master Funds have established initial credit approval, credit limits, and collateral requirements and may reduce their exposure to any counterparties they deem necessary. Trading in non-U.S. dollar denominated derivative instruments may subject the value of, and gains and losses associated with, such contracts to additional risks related to adverse changes in the applicable exchange rates.

Unrealized gains and losses from derivative financial instruments are recorded based on changes in their fair value. Realized gains and losses are recorded when the positions are closed. All unrealized and realized gains and losses related to derivative financial instruments are included in net gain (loss) on investments in the Master Funds  statements of operations.

Futures Contracts

The Master Funds use futures contracts in an attempt to take advantage of changes in the value of equities, commodities, interest rates, bonds and foreign currencies. Futures contracts are valued based upon the closing price as of the valuation date established by the primary exchange upon which they are traded.

A futures contract represents a commitment for the future purchase or sale of an asset or cash settlement based on the value of an asset on a specified date. The purchase and sale of futures contracts are executed on an exchange which requires margin deposits with a Futures Commission Merchant ( FCM ). Subsequent payments are made or received by the Master Funds each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract. These changes in valuation are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Master Funds. Relative to over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, futures contracts provide reduced counterparty risk to the Master Funds since futures are exchange-traded and the exchanges  clearing house guarantees the futures against default. However, some non-U.S. exchanges are  principals  markets  in which no common clearing facility exists and the Master Funds may look only to the clearing broker for performance of the contract. The U.S. Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all funds received from such FCM s customers in respect of regulated futures transactions. If the FCM were not to do so to the full extent required by law, the assets of the Master Funds might not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the FCM. In that case, the Master Funds would be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the FCM s combined customer accounts, even though certain property specifically traceable to the Master Funds was held by the FCM. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of an exchange or an affiliated clearing house, the Master Funds might experience a loss of funds deposited through its FCM as margin with such exchange or affiliated clearing house, the loss of unrealized profits on its open positions, and the loss of funds owed to it as realized profits on closed positions.

Forward Contracts

The Master Funds enter into foreign currency forward contracts in an attempt to take advantage of changes in exchange rates. Forward currency transactions are contracts or agreements for delivery of specific currencies or the cash equivalent value at a specified future date and an agreed upon price. Forward contracts are not guaranteed by an exchange or clearing house and therefore the risks include the inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the terms of the contracts as well as the risks associated with movements in fair value.

Exchange traded forward contracts are valued based upon the settlement prices as of the valuation date, established by the primary exchange upon which they are traded. All other forward contracts are valued based upon a forward curve constructed using independently quoted forward points. Changes in fair value of each forward contract are recognized as unrealized gains or losses.

Swap Contracts

The Master Funds may enter into various swap contracts in an attempt to take advantage of changes in interest rates and asset values. Exchange traded interest rate swap contracts are executed on an exchange which requires margin deposits with a Central Clearing Counterparty ( CCP ). Subsequent payments are made or received by the Master Funds each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract. These changes in valuation are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Master Funds. Relative to over-the-counter interest rate swap contracts, exchange traded interest rate swap contracts provide reduced counterparty risk since they are exchange-traded and the exchange s clearinghouse guarantees against default. The Commodity Exchange Act requires a CCP to segregate all funds received from such CCP s customers in respect of exchange traded interest rate swaps. If the CCP were not to do so to the full extent required by law, the assets of the Master Funds might not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the CCP. In that case, the Master Funds would be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the CCP s combined customer accounts, even though certain property specifically traceable to the Master Funds is held by the CCP. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of an exchange or an affiliated clearing house, the Master Funds could experience a loss of funds deposited through its CCP as margin with such exchange or affiliated clearing house, the loss of unrealized profits on its open positions, and the loss of funds owed to it as realized profits on closed positions. All funds deposited with both U.S. and non-U.S. CCPs are included in due from brokers on the statements of financial condition. Over the counter swap contracts are not guaranteed by an exchange or an affiliated clearing house or regulated by any U.S. or foreign government authorities. Failure of a counterparty to meet its obligation under the terms of the swap contract could result in the loss of any unrealized gains on open positions. It may not be possible to dispose of or close out a swap position without the consent of the counterparty, and the Master Funds may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover its risk.

An interest rate swap contract is an agreement that obligates two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified rates for a specified notional amount of the underlying assets. The payment flows are usually netted against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to another. Interest rate swap positions are generally valued as the present value of the net future cash flows as estimated by the Advisor using a discount curve constructed from independently obtained future interest rate assumptions.

A total return swap contract is an agreement that obligates two parties to exchange cash flows calculated by reference to changes in specified prices for a specified notional amount of the underlying assets. The payment flows are usually netted against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to another. Total return swaps are generally valued based upon the value of the underlying instruments as determined by the primary exchange on which they are traded.

Exchange traded swaps are valued based upon the last traded prices established by the primary exchange upon which they are traded. Changes in fair value of each swap are recognized as unrealized gains or losses. The Master Funds record realized gains or losses when a swap contract is terminated.

Options

The Master Funds may buy and sell covered and uncovered exchange traded and over-the-counter options on futures, foreign currencies, commodities, interest rates and equities to take advantage of the price movements of the financial instrument underlying the option or to hedge positions in the underlying assets. Option contracts give one party the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a limited time or on a specified date, a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price. Options may also be settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices or prices.

When purchasing options, the Master Funds are exposed to counterparty risk to the extent that a seller of an over-the-counter option does not meet its obligations under the terms of the option contract. The maximum risk of loss to the Master Funds is the unrealized gains of the contracts and the premiums paid to purchase its open option contracts. Relative to over-the-counter options, exchange traded options provide reduced counterparty risk to the Master Funds since the exchanges  clearinghouse guarantees the option against default.

Selling uncovered options may subject the Master Funds to unlimited risk of loss. As the writer of an option, the Master Funds bear the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the underlying instrument.

Exchange traded options are valued based upon the settlement prices published as of the valuation date by the principal exchange upon which they are traded. In the absence of an exchange published settlement price, the option will be valued using the last reported sales price reported on the exchange for the valuation date. Over-the-counter options and exchange traded options with no reported sales price on the valuation date will generally be valued at the average of last reported bid and offer quotes from independent brokers or from the exchange, respectively.

Credit Risk Related Contingent Features

OTC Derivative Instruments are subject to ISDA Master Agreements which generally require among other things, that the Master Funds maintain a predetermined level of net assets or rate of return, and provide limits with respect to any decline in value over 1-month, 3-month and 12-month periods. If the Master Funds were to violate such provisions, the counterparty to these instruments could demand liquidation of the outstanding positions. There were no events that occurred throughout the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or for the year ended December 31, 2015 which caused any counterparty to demand liquidation of any outstanding positions. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no Derivative Instruments subject to credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position for either of the Master Funds in which GAIT invests except for Graham Commodity Strategies LLC. Graham Commodity Strategies LLC had Derivative Instruments subject to credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position in the amount of $12,136,407 and $102,519 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15    Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern  (Subtopic 205-40). The pronouncement determines management s responsibility regarding the assessment of GAIT s ability to continue as a going concern even if GAIT s liquidation is not imminent. Under this guidance, during each period in which financial statements are prepared, management will need to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about GAIT s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Substantial doubt would exist if conditions or events indicate that GAIT will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due.   Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, however early adoption is permitted. The Manager is currently assessing the impact, if any, that this pronouncement will have on the disclosures within the financial statements. Any impact is expected to be minimal.

Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, the Master Funds, Cash Assets, and GAIT enter into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. Such contracts may include those by Cash Assets and the Master Funds with their brokers and trading counterparties. GAIT s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown; however, GAIT has not had prior claims or losses with respect to such indemnifications and considers the risk of loss to be remote. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no accruals have been recorded by GAIT for indemnifications.

4. Graham Cash Assets LLC

GAIT invests a portion of its excess liquidity in Cash Assets, an entity for which the Manager is also the sole investment advisor. Cash Assets commenced operations on June 22, 2005, and was formed as a Delaware Limited Liability Company for the purpose of consolidating investment activity of multiple funds managed by the Manager. Its objective is to preserve capital while enhancing return on cash balances and providing daily liquidity. It invests in debt obligations guaranteed by the U.S. federal government which range in maturity from one to twenty-six months. Cash Assets also maintains cash and cash equivalents on deposit with major U.S. institutions. Cash Assets values all fixed income securities at amortized cost which approximates fair value. GAIT s investment in Cash Assets is valued in the accompanying statements of financial condition at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP based upon GAIT s proportionate share of Cash Assets  reported net asset value. GAIT records its proportionate share of Cash Assets  investment income and expenses on a monthly basis. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the total amount recognized by GAIT with respect to its investment in Cash Assets was $177,535 and $532,422, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the total amount recognized by GAIT with respect to its investment in Cash Assets was $146,750 and $390,857, respectively. These amounts are included in interest income in the statements of operations and incentive allocation. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, GAIT owned approximately 2.89% and 4.02%, respectively, of Cash Assets.

5. Capital Accounts

GAIT offers Class 0 Units and Class 2 Units (collectively, the  Units ). GAIT may issue additional classes in the future subject to different fees, expenses or other terms, or to invest in other investment programs or combinations of investment programs managed by the Manager. GAIT also has Management Units ( Class M units ) which are solely for the investment of the Manager.

A separate capital account is maintained for each member with respect to each Class of Units held by such member. The initial balance of each member s capital account is equal to the initial contribution to GAIT with respect to the Class to which such capital account relates. Each member s Capital Account is increased by any additional subscription, and decreased by any redemption by such member of Units of such Class to which the capital account relates. All income and expenses of GAIT are allocated among the capital accounts of the members in proportion to the balance that each capital account bears to the balance of all capital accounts as of the beginning of such fiscal period.

Subscriptions

Units may be purchased at a price equal to the Net Asset Value per Unit of the relevant Class as of the immediately preceding Valuation Day, as defined in the LLC Agreement. There is no minimum subscription amount.

Units are available for subscription as of the first business day of each month upon written notice of at least three business days prior to the last business day of the preceding month.

Redemptions

Units are not subject to any minimum holding period. Members may redeem Units at the Net Asset Value thereof as of the last business day of each month upon not less than three business days  prior written notice to the administrator.

6. Fees and Related Party Transactions

Advisory Fees

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, each Class of GAIT other than Class M paid the Manager an advisory fee (the  Advisory Fee ) at an aggregate annual rate equal to 1.75% of the Net Asset Value of such Class. The Advisory Fee is payable monthly in arrears calculated as of the last business day of each month and any other date the Manager may permit, in its sole and absolute discretion, as of which any subscription or redemption is effected with respect to Units of such Class during the month.

6. Fees and Related Party Transactions (continued)

Sponsor Fees

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, each Class of GAIT other than Class M paid the Manager a sponsor fee (the  Sponsor Fee ) at an annual rate of the Net Asset Value specified in the table below. The Sponsor Fee is payable monthly in arrears calculated as of the last business day of each month in the same manner as the Advisory Fee.

Incentive Allocation

At the end of each calendar quarter, Graham Capital LLC, an affiliate of the Manager, will receive a special allocation of net profits (the  Incentive Allocation ) in an amount equal to 20% of the New High Net Trading Profits of each Class as defined in the LLC Agreement. The Incentive Allocation is also accrued and allocable on the date of redemption with respect to any Units that are redeemed prior to the end of a calendar quarter. Additionally, any loss carryforward attributable to any class of GAIT shall be proportionately reduced effective as of the date of any redemption of any Units of such class by multiplying the loss carryforward by the ratio that the amount of assets redeemed from such class bears to the net assets of such class immediately prior to such redemption. The loss carryforward of a class must be recouped before any subsequent Incentive Allocation can be made. The Incentive Allocation was $0 and $2,920,022 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Administrator s Fee

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, GAIT paid SEI a monthly administrator s fee based on GAIT s net asset value, calculated as of the last business day of each month. In addition, GAIT reimbursed SEI for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of GAIT. The total administrator s fees, including out-of-pocket expenses, incurred by GAIT for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $154,756 and $184,141, respectively, of which $12,700 and $19,836 was accrued as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Any portion of any of the above fees, including the Incentive Allocation, may be paid by the Manager to third parties as compensation for selling activities in connection with GAIT.

7. Income Taxes

No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements, as members are individually responsible for reporting income or loss based upon their respective share of GAIT s revenues and expenses for income tax purposes.

7. Income Taxes (continued)

U.S. GAAP provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. U.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing GAIT s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year and GAIT identifies its major tax jurisdictions as U.S. Federal and Connecticut State. The Manager has evaluated GAIT s tax positions and has concluded that there are no significant tax positions requiring recognition, measurement or disclosure in the financial statements for open tax years 2013 through 2015 or expected to be taken in GAIT s 2016 tax returns. The Manager is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax expense will change materially in the next twelve months. Tax years which are considered open by the relevant jurisdiction are subject to potential examination.

The following represents ratios to average members  capital, excluding the Managing Member, and total return for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Total return is calculated for Class 0 and Class 2 units taken as a whole. Total return is calculated as the change in total members  capital, excluding that of the Managing Member, adjusted for subscriptions or redemptions during the period. An individual member s return may vary from these returns based on the timing of capital transactions and the applicability of Advisory Fees, Sponsor Fees, Administrator s Fees, and the Incentive Allocation. The net investment loss and total expense ratios (including Incentive Allocation) are calculated for the Class 0 and Class 2 units taken as a whole and include amounts from GAIT and net investment loss and expenses allocated from Master Funds and investment income from Cash Assets. The computation of such ratios is based on the amount of net investment loss, total expenses and Incentive Allocation. Net investment loss and total expense ratios have not been annualized and are computed based upon the weighted average of members  capital of GAIT, excluding that of the Managing Member, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

9. Subsequent Events

GAIT had subscriptions of approximately $7.4 million and redemptions of approximately $1.3 million from October 1, 2016 through November 14, 2016, the date through which subsequent events were evaluated by management. These amounts have not been included in the financial statements.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following is a discussion of our current financial position and results of operations. This discussion should be read together with our annual financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016. This discussion should also be read in conjunction with  Item 1: Financial Statements.  The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis. For the purposes of this filing beginning with Item 2, the term  Fund  shall include the Blended Strategies Portfolio of GAIF I, GAIT and the Master Funds in which they invest, unless the context implies otherwise. The Fund does not engage in the sale of goods or services. The Fund s capital consists of capital contributions of the members, as increased or decreased by gains and losses from its investments in the Master Funds, interest, expenses and redemptions. Its only assets are its investments in the Master Funds. The Master Funds do not engage in the sale of goods or services. Their assets are comprised of the equity in their accounts with clearing brokers and OTC counterparties, in each case consisting of cash, open trade equity on derivatives and the net option premium paid or received. In the case of Graham Cash Assets LLC ( Cash Assets ), the assets consist of investments in debt obligations guaranteed by the U.S. federal government, as well as cash and cash equivalents.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Blended Strategies Portfolio s net asset value decreased by $8,250,693 or -10.2%. The net decrease in the Blended Strategies Portfolio was attributable to redemptions totaling $5,017,818 or -6.2 % and a net loss of $3,482,875 or -4.3% partially offset by total subscriptions of $250,000 or 0.3%, for the period.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Blended Strategies Portfolio s net asset value decreased by $13,427,410 or -15.6%. The net decrease in the Blended Strategies Portfolio was attributable to redemptions totaling $9,724,150 or -11.3% and a net loss of $5,137,999 or -6.0% partially offset by total subscriptions of $1,434,739 or 1.7%, for the period.

For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Blended Strategies Portfolio s net asset value increased by $594,530 or 0.7%.  The net increase in the Blended Strategies Portfolio was attributable to total subscriptions of $2,038,000 or 2.3% and net income of $540,440 or 0.6% partially offset by redemptions totaling $1,983,910 or -2.2% , for the period.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Blended Strategies Portfolio s net asset value increased by $2,145,961 or 2.4%. The net increase in the Blended Strategies Portfolio was attributable to total subscriptions of $5,780,000 or 6.5% and net income of $262,083 or 0.3% partially offset by redemptions totaling $3,896,122 or -4.4%, for the period.

2016 Summary

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Blended Strategies Portfolio experienced net trading losses of $2,794,857. The trading results are attributable to the following sectors:

The Blended Strategies Portfolio recorded a net loss for the third quarter of 2016. Losses resulted primarily from trading commodities, particularly from positions in the energy complex with smaller losses in agricultural commodities and metals. The portfolio also experienced losses in U.S. fixed income futures as well as in foreign exchange, most notably from positions in the euro, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. Positions in equity index futures led to gains for the portfolio, including U.S., European and Asian benchmark indices, which offset a portion of the overall losses during the quarter.

Advisory, Sponsor, and Administrator s Fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund s net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, interest income, subscriptions into and redemptions out of the Fund. Accordingly, the fluctuations in these amounts are directly correlated to the changes in net asset value which are discussed in detail herein.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, Advisory Fees decreased by $67,123 or -16.4%, Sponsor Fees decreased by $43,523 or -13.8%, and Administrator s Fees decreased by $7,228 or -22.2% in the Fund over the corresponding period of the preceding year. These decreases are all attributable to lower net assets of the portfolio resulting from redemptions and a net loss partially offset by subscriptions for the period. During the same period, interest income increased by $18,454 or 23.6%. Interest was earned on free cash at an average annualized yield of 0.55% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.40% for the same period in 2015.

The Incentive Allocation is based on the New High Net Trading Profits of the portfolio. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the portfolio has not yet recovered previous losses. As a result, there was no Incentive Allocation for those periods.

Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Blended Strategies Portfolio experienced net trading losses of $2,952,532. The trading results are attributable to the following sectors:

The Blended Strategies Portfolio recorded a net loss year-to-date through the third quarter of 2016. The portfolio has experienced losses in foreign exchange, primarily from trading the euro and Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar. The portfolio has recorded losses in commodities as profits from trading coffee, gold and silver were more than offset by losses from positions across the energy complex and in copper. In equity index futures, the portfolio has experienced losses from trading in U.S., European and Asian benchmark indices. In fixed income futures, gains from positions on the long end of the yield curve in Europe and Asia were more than offset by losses from positions in the Eurodollar.

Advisory, Sponsor, and Administrator s Fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund s net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, interest income, subscriptions into and redemptions out of the Fund. Accordingly, the fluctuations in these amounts are directly correlated to the changes in net asset value which are discussed in detail herein.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Advisory Fees decreased by $168,665 or -13.7%, Sponsor Fees decreased by $104,108 or -11.0%, and Administrator s Fees decreased by $15,674 or -16.0% in the Fund over the corresponding period of the preceding year. These decreases are all attributable to lower net assets of the portfolio resulting from redemptions and a net loss partially offset by subscriptions for the period. During the same period, interest income increased by $75,139 or 36.2%. Interest was earned on free cash at an average annualized yield of 0.52% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.34% for the same period in 2015.

The Incentive Allocation is based on the New High Net Trading Profits of the portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Incentive Allocation decreased by $1,550,824 over the corresponding period of the preceding year. This was the result of a net loss before incentive allocation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net gain before incentive allocation for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

The following table illustrates the sector distribution of the Fund s investments in Master Funds as of September 30, 2016 based on the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities in each Master Fund including both long and short positions.

2015 Summary

Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Blended Strategies Portfolio experienced net trading gains of $1,396,336. The trading results are attributable to the following sectors:

The Blended Strategies Portfolio recorded a net gain for the third quarter of 2015. The Portfolio recorded gains from positions in commodity futures, particularly in energy and metals. In foreign exchange, trading commodity currencies versus the U.S. dollar contributed to the overall profits. In fixed income futures, the Portfolio recorded gains from positions on the short end of the yield curve in the U.S. and on the long end of the yield curve in Europe and Asia. Losses in equity index futures, most notably from long positions in Asian and European benchmark indices, offset a portion of the Portfolio s gains for the quarter.

Advisory, Sponsor, and Administrator s Fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund s net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, interest income, subscriptions into and redemptions out of the Fund. Accordingly, the fluctuations in these amounts are directly correlated to the changes in net asset value which are discussed in detail herein.

For the three months ended September 30, 2015, Advisory Fees increased by $28,196 or 7.4%, Sponsor Fees increased by $39,030 or 14.1%, and Administrator s Fees increased by $2,484 or 8.3% in the Fund over the corresponding period of the preceding year. These increases are all attributable to higher net assets of the portfolio resulting from subscriptions and net income partially offset by redemptions for the period. During the same period, interest income increased by $34,183 or 77.6%. Interest was earned on free cash at an average annualized yield of 0.40% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 0.26% for the same period in 2014.

The Incentive Allocation is based on the New High Net Trading Profits of the portfolio. For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 the portfolio had not yet recovered previous losses. As a result, there was no Incentive Allocation for those periods.

Nine months Ended September 30, 2015 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Blended Strategies Portfolio experienced net trading gains of $4,435,074. The trading results are attributable to the following sectors:

59 

Index 

The Blended Strategies Portfolio posted a net gain through the third quarter of 2015. The Portfolio recorded gains from foreign exchange trading, most notably from a long bias in the U.S. dollar versus the euro and commodity currencies. Gains also resulted from positions in equity index futures, particularly in Asia and Europe. Profits in European fixed income futures were offset by losses in the U.S. and Australia. In commodity futures, losses in agricultural commodities, most notably in soybeans and corn, offset the gains in metals and energy, in particular aluminum and crude oil.

Advisory, Sponsor, and Administrator s Fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund s net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, interest income, subscriptions into and redemptions out of the Fund. Accordingly, the fluctuations in these amounts are directly correlated to the changes in net asset value which are discussed in detail herein.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Advisory Fees increased by $66,567 or 5.7%, Sponsor Fees increased by $125,665 or 15.4%, and Administrator s Fees increased by $7,918 or 8.8% in the Fund over the corresponding period of the preceding year. These increases are all attributable to higher net assets of the portfolio resulting from subscriptions and net income partially offset by redemptions for the period. During the same period, interest income increased by $66,197 or 46.9%. Interest was earned on free cash at an average annualized yield of 0.34% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 0.25% for the same period in 2014.

The Incentive Allocation is based on the New High Net Trading Profits of the portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Incentive Allocation increased by $1,550,824. This was the result of a higher net gain before incentive allocation for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the portfolio had not yet recovered previous losses. As a result, there was no Incentive Allocation for that period.

The following table illustrates the sector distribution of the Fund s investments in Master Funds as of September 30, 2015 based on the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities in each master fund including both long and short positions. Positive percentages represent net assets whereas negative percentages represent a net liability.

Variables Affecting Performance

The Fund s performance is affected by net profitability resulting from the trading operations of the Master Funds, the fees charged by the Fund, and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents. The Master Funds acquire and liquidate long and short positions in futures contracts, forwards contracts, spot currency contracts and associated derivative instruments such as options and swaps. These instruments are carried at fair value, which is heavily influenced by a wide variety of factors including but not limited to, the level and volatility of exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices as well as global macro political events. These factors generate market movements affecting the fair value of these instruments and in turn the net gains and losses allocated from the Master Funds.

60 

Index 

Advisory, Sponsor, and Administrator s Fees are calculated based on a percentage of the Fund s net asset value. Changes in the net assets of the Fund resulting from subscriptions, redemptions, interest and trading profits allocated from the Master Funds can therefore have a material impact on the fee expense of the Fund.

A portion of the assets of the Fund is held in cash and cash equivalents. Changes in the net assets of the Fund as well as changes in the interest rates earned on these investments can have a material impact on interest income earned.

(ii) Liquidity

There are no known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or are reasonably likely to result in the Fund s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.

A portion of the Fund s assets is generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Fund s investments.   It is expected that the average margin the Fund will be required to post to support the Fund s trading may range between 10% and 30% of the Fund s total assets, which will be segregated or secured by the futures brokers in accordance with the CEA and with CFTC regulations or be maintained on deposit with over-the-counter counterparties. In exceptional market conditions, this amount could increase. The Master Funds are subject to margin calls on a constant daily and intra-day basis, whether in connection with initiating new investment positions or as a result of changes in the value of current investment positions. These margin requirements are met through the posting of additional margin with the applicable futures or FX clearing broker, on an almost daily basis. The Manager generally expresses its margin requirements for the portfolios in terms of the aggregate of the margin requirements for the underlying strategies plus the net option premium costs for the underlying strategies. The following table shows these amounts as of the date indicated:

Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Fund s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so. Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Fund s futures trading. Through September 30, 2016, the Fund experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Manager on behalf of the Fund.

(iii) Capital Resources

The Fund raises additional capital through the sale of Units and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income. The Fund may borrow money from brokers or their affiliates and other lenders. Units may be offered for sale as of the beginning, and may be redeemed as of the end, of each month. The amount of capital raised for the Fund should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Fund has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for monies to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.

The Fund participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements. The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges. Further, the Fund s brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements. The Fund bears the risk of financial failure of the brokers through which it clears trades and maintains margin in respect of any such trades and of its counterparties for its foreign exchange and swap trades with whom it also maintains margin.

(iv) Critical Accounting Policies

Presentation    Graham Alternative Investment Fund I LLC is a series Limited Liability Company under Delaware law. The financial statements and corresponding footnotes are presented solely for the Blended Strategies Portfolio, except where otherwise noted.

Use of Estimates    The Fund s financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and all amounts are stated in U.S. dollars except where noted. The preparation of the financial statements requires the Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Fund s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2 of the financial statements.

Fair Value Measurement    The Fund follows U.S. GAAP for fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. U.S. GAAP uses a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement based on the transparency and independence of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The Fund reports the fair value of its investment-related assets and liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy established under U.S. GAAP.

The Fund records its investments in GAIT at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In determining its net asset value, GAIT records its investments in Master Funds at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Fund records its proportionate share of GAIT s investment income and loss, expenses, fees, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on a monthly basis. Purchases and sales of units in GAIT are recorded on a trade date basis. The accounting policies of GAIT are described in its attached financial statements.

The Master Funds record all their financial instruments at fair value, which is derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Unrealized gains and losses from these instruments are recorded based on changes in their fair value. Realized gains and losses are recorded when the positions are closed. All unrealized and realized gains and losses related to derivative financial instruments are included in net gain (loss) on investments in the Master Funds  statements of operations.

Investment Company      The Fund applies specialized accounting guidance as outlined in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update 2013-08, Financial Services   Investment Companies (Topic 946),  Amendments to the Scope, Measurement, and Disclosure Requirements , and is an investment company within the meaning of such guidance. The Manager has evaluated this guidance and has determined the Fund meets the criteria to be classified as an investment company.

Cash Assets    GAIT invests a portion of its excess liquidity in Cash Assets, an entity for which the Manager is also the sole investment advisor. The financial information of Cash Assets is included in the notes to the Financial Statements of GAIT.

Income Taxes      No provision for income taxes has been made in the Fund s financial statements, as each member is responsible for reporting income or loss based upon the member s respective share of the Fund s revenues and expenses for income tax purposes.

U.S. GAAP provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. U.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year and the Fund identifies its major tax jurisdictions as U.S. Federal and Connecticut State. The Manager has evaluated the Fund s tax positions and has concluded that there are no significant tax positions requiring recognition, measurement or disclosure in the financial statements for open tax years 2013 through 2015 or expected to be taken in the Fund s 2016 tax returns. The Manager is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax expense will change materially in the next twelve months. Tax years which are considered open by the relevant jurisdiction are subject to potential examination.

(v)           Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Fund does not engage in off-balance sheet arrangements with other entities.

    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures 

The Fund has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Fund in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Manager and the Fund s management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2016, the Manager, along with the Manager s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
