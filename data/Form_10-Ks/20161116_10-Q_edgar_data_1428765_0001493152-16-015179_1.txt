CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION   

Statements
in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q may be  forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include, but
are not limited to, statements that express our intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements
relating to our future activities or other future events or conditions. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates
and projections about our business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results
may, and are likely to, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerous
factors, including those described above and those risks discussed from time to time in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including
the risks described under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in other documents which we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition,
such statements could be affected by risks and uncertainties related to our ability to raise any financing which we may require
for our operations, competition, government regulations and requirements, pricing and development difficulties, our ability to
make acquisitions and successfully integrate those acquisitions with our business, as well as general industry and market conditions
and growth rates, and general economic conditions. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are
made, and, except as may be required under applicable securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking
statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

    NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Note 1     Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies:   

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our Company and our new subsidiary, Smart Fuel Solutions, Inc. On September
28, 2016, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Smart Fuel Solutions, Inc., (Smart Fuel) a Florida Corporation, established
and staffed as a service company. Smart Fuel will undertake and/or assist with the operational responsibilities of the Company.
Smart Fuel is a private company, majority owned by us. Our management will continue to focus on business development as its major
priority. We will utilize Smart Fuel s abilities to assist us with management, engineering and development of proposed plant
projects and promotion of the Company. The ownership interest in Smart Fuel, held by third parties, are presented in the consolidated
balance sheet within the equity section as a line item identified as  non-controlling interest , separate from the
parent s equity. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation. Please
refer to note 5 for further information concerning Smart Fuel Solutions, Inc.  

The
Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared by us in accordance with the accounting policies described in our December
31, 2015 and 2014 audited financial statements included in Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with the Notes to the Financial
Statements which appear in that report.  

The
preparation of these unaudited financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including related
intangible assets, income taxes, insurance obligations and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other resources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

In
the opinion of management, the information furnished in these interim unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary
for a fair statement of the financial position and results of operations and cash flows as of and for the nine-months - ended
September 30, 2016, and 2015. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the interim
period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which
would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period,
as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.  

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior period s financial statements to conform to the current period s presentation.  

Note
2 Going Concern    

These
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes we will be able to realize our assets and discharge
our liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we
had a net loss of $1,441,647. The majority of this loss consisted of $763,241 in warrants issued for services rendered; it also
included $126,870 in losses from debt being converted into common stock of the Company. We also have a working capital deficit
of $2,655,896. This deficit represents a decrease in the working capital deficit from last quarter ended June 30, 2016 by $1,650,143.
This reduction of working capital deficit from the previous quarter was due to accrued wages of current and past employees being
converted into common stock warrants. It also included $152,905 of notes payable being converted into common stock. We have accumulated
a deficit of $22,035,630 since inception. This factor raises doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

GREEN
ENVIROTECH HOLDINGS CORP.  

  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts,
or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from a future uncertainty. Our working capital deficit is dropping
and and our note holders are receptive to converting debt for equity in our Company when certain milestones are met. We have already
converted $152,904 of our notes payable into our common stock. We are also receiving positive feedback from our old vendors interested
in converting into our stock for their debt. Please see the note on subsequent events. We already have commitments to convert
$144,845 in accounts payable into our common stock.  

Note
3 Loan Payable   Related Party    

We have an unsecured line
of credit with H. E. Capital, S. A., a related party. The line of credit accrues interest at the rate of 8% per annum. The due
date of the line of credit has been extended to December 31, 2016. Balance of the line of credit at September 30, 2016 was $385,677
with accrued interest in the amount of $115,572. We also have an agreement with H.E. Capital wherein we pay $5,000 monthly for
financial services. As of September 30, 2016, $45,000 was due under these terms. H. E. Capital during the year assigned $215,405
of its debt to third parties of which $115,405 was converting into 1,154,054 shares of the Company s stock. A schedule of
the H. E. Capital loan activity with use for 2016 is as follows:

       $53,500. Smart Fuel satisfied an accrued liability for the Company in the amount of $25,000 and paid $28,500 to the Company
       which was used for working capital. This note was paid in full on June 2, 2016 from an increase in the line of credit from
       H. E. Capital, S.A.  

On
December 29, 2015, we approved H.E. Capital S.A. s (HEC) request to assign to a private individual $12,500 of its Line of

intended for the use of Smart Fuel Solutions. We intend to be a majority owner of Smart Fuel Solutions in the future by issuing
licensing agreements for the use of our technology. In March 2016, we requested and Smart Fuel Solutions agreed to be totally
responsible for the $134,000 note. The note was assigned and accepted by Smart Fuel Solutions. On September 28, 2016 when we acquired
controlling interest in Smart Fuel Solutions, Inc. (see Note 6) we assumed the note again. As of September 30, 2016, the accrued
interest on this note was $6,902.  

On

on the line of credit. There was no accrued interest. $10,000 in interest expense had been paid by September 30, 2016.  

The

4 Loan Payable   Other   

We
issued an 8% promissory note in the amount of $150,000 on March 19, 2013 to a private investor. This note is extended to December
31, 2016. The Company used the proceeds from this note for working capital. As of September 30, 2016 this loan has an outstanding
balance of $150,000 and accrued interest in the amount of $45,616.   

On
January 24, 2011, we entered into a series of securities purchase agreements with accredited investors pursuant to which we sold
an aggregate of $380,000 in 12% secured debentures. The Debentures are secured by the assets of the Company pursuant to security
agreements entered into between us and the investors.    As
of September 30, 2016 these secured debentures have an outstanding balance of $305,000 and accrued interest in the amount of $227,867.
These debentures are in default and the Company is in negotiations with the holders for extensions.   

On May 16, 2016, we approved H.E.
Capital S.A. s (HEC) request to assign to a private company $200,000 of its Line of Credit Note. We approved the request
and reduced HEC s Line of Credit Note for that amount and record a new note. On July 19, 2016, the private company converted
$100,000 of its note into 1,000,000 common shares of the Company s stock. As of September 30, 2016, the accrued interest
on this note was $4,427. 

On May 18, 2015, we approved the
Debt Assignment Agreement dated 5/18/2015 between H.E. Capital S.A. and Valuecorp Trading Company (Valuecorp). We also approved
the Debt Settlement Agreement dated 5/19/2015 between the Company and Valuecorp wherein the Company will settle its debt of $12,500
to Valuecorp by issuing 416,667 shares of common stock to Valuecorp at $0.03 per share. To date, this note has not been presented
for conversion. As of September 30, 2016, the accrued interest on this note was $1,318. 

We have two other notes outstanding.
We issued note in the amount of $7,500 on February 25, 2010 and the other note for $170,000 was issued on November 16, 2012. These
notes are to private parties and accrue interest at the rate of 8%. Both notes have been extended to December 31, 2016. As of
September 30, 2016, their accrued interest was $6,533 and $4,422 respectively. The accrued interest in the amount of $49,295 reported
for the $170,000 on June 30, 2016 was converted into a new note dated July 1, 2016 under the same conditions as the original note,
accruing interest at 8%. 

The
total in loans payable as of September 30, 2016 was $794,295, and accrued interest was $290,183.  

Note
5 Commitment and Contingency   

During
the fourth quarter 2014, we were faced with satisfying a disputed obligation with one of our vendors by issuing 150,000 free trading
shares of the Company. The debt had not matured for the amount of time required for the obligation to receive free trading shares.
In order to satisfy the debt, we entered into an agreement with H. E. Capital, S.A. to convert $30,000 of its Line of Credit Note
with us into 150,000 of our free trading shares. H. E. Capital S.A. converted the required portion of its debt from us into the
shares needed and issued 25,000 free trading shares in December 2014 and the balance of 125,000 free trading shares in February
2015. We accrued the $30,000 liability on our books until the debt was totally satisfied in February 2015. On or about June 18,
2015, the Plaintiff moved for a judgment alleging we defaulted under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The Plaintiff s
position was that the Settlement Shares were unsellable since we were delinquent in our periodic filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On June 23, 2015, we filed an opposition to the Plaintiff s pleadings. On June 29, 2015
the Court entered a judgment in favor of the Plaintiff in the amount of $42,111. GETH intends to appeal the judgement as Defendant
has satisfied the outstanding amount.

TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

On
May 13, 2015, we agreed with EraStar, one of our vendors, to resolve the outstanding balance of $120,000 owed to EraStar by us
for an amount of $20,000 or issue 20,000 free trading shares on or before December 31, 2016. On October 1, 2015, we agreed with
EraStar to an amendment to the May 13, 2015 Settlement wherein for the 350,000 shares currently issued to EraStar for services
rendered, GETH may cancel these shares and reissue a total of 370,000 shares to EraStar or its assigns as directed for full consideration
of contractual obligations. To date these shares have not been issued. These shares will be issued in the fourth quarter 2016.  

On
August 17, 2016, we were notified we had won a judgement against Naranza Capital Partners, LLC and/or Lee V. Partee in the amount
of $170,661. On November 23, 2010, we signed a lease agreement with Naranza for equipment to be used in our Riverbank, CA plant
being developed at that time. We invested $261,890 in the lease of the equipment and recorded the lease on our financial statements.
When it became apparent we were not going to get the equipment or the refund of our deposit, we provided all our transaction information
to the authorities. We wrote off the deposit during the year ended December 31, 2012, which was reflected on our financial statements
for that year. We will record the settlement amount as other income when we receive it.

Overview
of Our Business   

Green
EnviroTech Holdings Corp. (the  Company ) is a pioneer in sustainable development. We integrate and commercialize
proven technologies and pioneer proprietary technologies to convert waste into valuable products and help to protect the planet.  

Our
mission is to find and implement practical, economical solutions that will clean up the environment, create local jobs and stimulate
economic growth in the communities where we do business.  

Corporate
History   

On
November 20, 2009, the Company, formerly known as Wolfe Creek Mining, Inc., entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
 Merger Agreement ) with Green EnviroTech Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation, and Green EnviroTech Corp. On July
20, 2010, the Company changed its name to Green EnviroTech Holdings Corp.  

Recent
Developments   

On
September 28, 2016 The Company established a controlling interest in Smart Fuel Solutions, Inc. (Smart Fuel), a Florida Corporation
formed on November 20, 2015, when we received 17,000,000 shares of their common stock. We received the shares in exchange for
providing the technology and $53,710 for operating capital.  

Smart
Fuel is an operating company whose team has 50 years of combined experience in the waste recycling sector. The Company recruited
Chris Bowers to become CEO of Smart Fuel. Smart Fuel will undertake research and development, engineering, and provide the staffing,
maintenance and management of the facilities.  

In
September 2016, the Company received a process performance certification for their Generation 1 (Gen 1) end of life Tire Processing
Solution from BHP Engineering   Construction LP. This is a momentous achievement as the Company can now secure financing for
projects that will recycle end of life tires anywhere in the world. Not only is the Gen 1 end of life Tire Processing Solution
fundable, it also produces excellent financial returns to funding partners. We look forward to being able to announce in the near
future we have installed and been commissioned to operate a Gen1 end of life tire processing plant.  

We
continue to be in investment mode; we anticipate these investments will generate revenues in 2017.

Critical
Accounting Policy and Estimates   

Our
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation
of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition,
accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates
inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets
and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources.  

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, together with notes thereto as previously filed with our Annual Report
on Form 10-K. In addition, these accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in
the notes to the financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for prior quarter filings.

We
will seek to raise additional funds to meet our working capital needs principally through the additional sales of our securities.
However, we cannot guaranty that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed, or that such funds, if available,
will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us.  

We
had cash of $106,370 as of September 30, 2016. In the opinion of management, our available funds will not satisfy our working
capital requirements for the next twelve months. Our forecast for the period for which our financial resources will be adequate
to support our operations involves risks and uncertainties and actual results could fail as a result of a number of factors. We
will need to raise additional capital to expand our operations to the point at which we are able to generate revenues and operate
profitably. At present, we have no operations to generate revenue.  

We
intend to pursue capital through public or private financing as well as borrowings and other sources, such as our officers, directors
and principal shareholders. We cannot guarantee that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate
funds are not available, then our ability to expand our operations may be significantly hindered. If adequate funds are not available,
we believe that our officers, directors and principal shareholders will contribute funds to pay for our expenses to achieve our
objectives over the next twelve months. However, our officers, directors and principal shareholders are not committed to contribute
funds to pay for our expenses.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.

information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) (principal executive and financial
officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Management
designed the disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.
Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
are ineffective until such time the first plant is funded and the Company has operations. Once the Company has operations, it
will have sufficient resources to address the inefficiencies.  

Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting   

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during the six months ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
