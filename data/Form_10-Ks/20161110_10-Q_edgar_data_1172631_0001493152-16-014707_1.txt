BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management, which is responsible for
their integrity and objectivity. In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair
presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sunworks and its wholly owned operating Subsidiaries.
All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  

Table
of Contents   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair
presentation have been included. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates
used to review the Company s goodwill, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage
of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory valuation, valuations of non-cash capital stock
issuances and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenues
and related costs on construction contracts are recognized using the  percentage of completion method  of accounting
in accordance with Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts ( ASC 605-35 ).
Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct
proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct
material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general
and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred. However, in the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company
recognizes the loss, as it is determined.  

The
Asset,  Costs in excess of billings , represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on contracts in progress.
The Liability,  Billings in excess of costs , represents billings in excess of revenues recognized on contracts in
progress. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the costs in excess of billings balance were $8,108,000 and $2,130,000
and the billings in excess of costs balance were $3,800,000 and $1,990,000 respectively.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalent   

The
Company considers all liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
had $37,000 of restricted cash at September 30, 2016.  

Concentration
Risk   

The
Company maintains several bank accounts at multiple financial institutions for its operations. These accounts are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $250,000 per institution. Management believes the Company is not exposed
to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which these deposits are held. As of
September 30, 2016, the cash balance in excess of the FDIC limits was $6,258,000.  

Contracts
Receivable   

The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers. Management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors
surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, age of receivables and other information, and records bad
debts using the allowance method. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $50,000 at September
30, 2016, and $0 at December 31, 2015.

Inventory   

Inventory
is valued at the lower of cost or market and is determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventory consists primarily of
solar panels and other materials.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is recorded on the straight-line method over the respective
useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the initial term of the leases.

Depreciation
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $215,000 and $26,000 respectively.  

Long-Lived
Assets   

The
Company reviews its property and equipment and any identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The test for impairment is required to be performed by management
at least annually. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to the future undiscounted operating cash flow expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of
the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.  

Indefinite
Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets   

The
Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805,  Business
Combinations,  where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available,
and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset
valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the
tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.  

The
Company tests for indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events
or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance
with its policies, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill at December 31,
2015 and determined there was no impairment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Disclosures
about fair value of financial instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the
balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of September 30, 2016, the amounts reported for cash, accrued
interest and other expenses, and notes payable approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.  

Table
of Contents   

We
adopted ASC Topic 820 as of January 1, 2008 for financial instruments measured as fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820
defines fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes
the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (level 1measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
These tiers include:  

Level
    1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;   

Level
    2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as
    quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that
    are not active; and   

Level
    3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
    assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value
    drivers are unobservable.   

Warranty
Liability   

The
Company establishes warranty liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of installation and product
defects, product recalls and litigation incidental to the Company s business. Liability estimates are determined based on
management s judgment, considering such factors as historical experience, the likely current cost of corrective action,
manufacturers  and subcontractors  participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third
party experts such as engineers, and discussions with the Company s general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle
specific product liability cases. Solar panel manufacturers currently provide substantial warranties between ten to twenty-five
years with full reimbursement to replace and install replacement panels while inverter manufacturers currently provide warranties
covering ten to fifteen-year replacement and installation. Warranty costs and associated liabilities for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and $0, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $13,000
and $0, respectively.  

Selling
and Marketing   

The
Company expenses selling and marketing costs as incurred. Selling and marketing costs include printed material, direct mail, radio,
telemarketing, tradeshow costs, magazine and catalog advertisements. Selling and marketing costs for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,145,000 and $1,835,000 respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were
$7,932,000 and $5,179,000 respectively.  

Research
and Development Costs   

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs consist primarily of consulting fees, salaries and direct payroll
related costs. The costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and $6,000 respectively, and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and $53,000 respectively.

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC 718, which requires the measurement and
recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to be based on estimated fair values. The Company uses
the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes
option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options. For restricted stock
units, the value of the award is based on the Company s stock price at the grant date. For performance-based restricted
stock unit awards, the value of the award is based on the Company s stock price at the grant date, with consideration given
to the probability of the performance condition being achieved. The Company uses historical data and other information to estimate
the expected price volatility for stock option awards and the expected forfeiture rate for all awards. Expense is recognized over
the vesting period for all awards, and commences at the grant date for time-based awards and upon the Company s determination
that the achievement of such performance conditions is probable for performance-based awards. This determination requires significant
judgment by management.  

Basic
and Diluted Net (Loss) Income per Share Calculations   

(Loss)
Income per Share dictates the calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share
are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted
earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional
common shares were dilutive. The shares for employee options, warrants and convertible notes were used in the calculation of the
income per share.  

For
the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company has excluded 938,188 options and 2,997,000 warrants outstanding because they
are below the period ending stock price. The Company has also excluded Series B preferred stock convertible into 1,506,024 shares
of common stock due to trading restrictions. For the prior period ended September 30, 2015, the Company excluded 899,574 options,
2,997,000 warrants outstanding, and notes convertible into 5,168,639 shares of common stock because their impact on the loss per
share is anti-dilutive.  

Segment
Reporting   

Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly
by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance.
The Company currently has one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes, which represents the Company s core business.  

Recently
adopted pronouncements   

In
January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-1 which amended the guidance for recognition and measurement of financial assets and
liabilities. These amendments address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
The adoption of this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those years. Early adoption of certain provisions of this guidance is permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
Entities should apply these amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of
the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair value should be applied
prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a
significant impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, which creates ASC Topic 842,  Leases.  This update increases transparency

ACQUISITION CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES

January 31, 2014, the Company issued 4% convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,750,000 as part of
the consideration paid to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of Sunworks United. The notes are convertible into
shares of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock. The conversion price was $0.52 per share until March 30, 2015,
which was amended to extend to March 31, 2016. The Notes were five (5) year notes and bore interest at the rate of 4% per annum.
In February and March 2014, $625,000 of the notes was converted into 1,201,923 shares of common stock, leaving a remaining note
balance of $1,125,000 as of December 31, 2014. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued 721,154 shares

On
February 28, 2015, the Company issued a 4% convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $2,650,000 as part
of the consideration paid to acquire 100% of the total outstanding stock of MD Energy. The note is convertible into shares of
common stock on or after each of the following dates: November 30, 2015, November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2017. The conversion
price is $2.60 per share. A beneficial conversion feature of $3,261,500 was calculated but capped at the $2,650,000 value of the
note. The beneficial conversion feature was calculated by multiplying the difference between the fair value of stock at the date
of the note $5.80 less the conversion price of $2.60 multiplied by the maximum number of share subject to conversion, 1,019,231.
In November 2015, the Company issued 339,743 shares of common stock upon conversion of the principal amount of $883,000. Commencing
on March 31, 2015, and each quarter thereafter during the first two (2) years of the note, the Company will make quarterly interest
only payments to the shareholder for accrued interest on the Note during the quarter. Commencing with the quarter ending on June
30, 2017, the Company will make quarterly payments of interest accrued on the convertible note during the prior quarter plus $221,000
with the final payment of all outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the convertible note due and payable on
February 28, 2020 (the maturity date). The Company recorded amortization of the beneficial conversion feature as interest expense
in the amount of $210,000 and $240,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $693,000 and
$565,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The debt discount will be amortized over the
life of the convertible note, or until such time that the convertible note is converted, in full or in part, into shares of common
stock of the Company with any unamortized debt discount continuing to be amortized in the event of any partial conversion thereof
and any unamortized debt discount being expensed at such time of full conversion thereof.  

We
evaluated the foregoing financing transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 470, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, and determined
that the conversion feature of the convertible promissory note was afforded the exemption for conventional convertible instruments
due to its fixed conversion rate. The convertible promissory notes have explicit limits on the number of shares issuable so they
did meet the conditions set forth in current accounting standards for equity classification. The convertible promissory notes
were issued with non-detachable conversion options that are beneficial to the investors at inception, because the conversion option
has an effective strike price that is less than the market price of the underlying stock at the commitment date. The accounting
for the beneficial conversion feature requires that the beneficial conversion feature be recognized by allocating the intrinsic
value of the conversion option to additional paid-in-capital, resulting in a discount on the convertible notes, which will be
amortized and recognized as interest expense.

originally matured on October 28, 2014, was extended three months to January 31, 2015, was extended to September 30, 2016, and
in March 2016 was subsequently extended to June 30, 2019 with zero interest. The Company recorded interest expense in the amount

note in the principal amount of up to $100,000. Upon execution of the note, the Company received an initial advance of $20,000.
In February and March, the Company received additional advances in an aggregate amount of $80,000 for an aggregate total of $100,000.
The note was convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a price equal to a variable conversion price equal to the
lesser of $1.30 per share, or fifty percent (50%) of the lowest trading price after the effective date. As of September 30, 2014,
the note was exchanged for a new note with a fixed price of $0.338, and convertible into shares of common stock. Per ASC 815,
the derivative liability on the note was extinguished and the new note was re-valued per ASC 470 as a beneficial conversion feature.
The note matured on various dates from the effective date of each advance with respect to each advance. At the sole discretion
of the lender, the lender was able to modify the maturity date to be twelve (12) months from the effective date of each advance.
The note matured on various dates in 2014, and was extended to September 30, 2016, and in March 2016 was subsequently extended
to June 30, 2019 with zero interest. The Company recorded interest expense in the amount of $0 and $8,000 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

At
the time of issuance, the Company evaluated the financing transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging,
and determined that the conversion feature of the convertible promissory note was not afforded the exemption for conventional
convertible instruments due to its variable conversion rate. The notes had no explicit limit on the number of shares issuable
so they did not meet the conditions set forth in current accounting standards for equity classification. The Company elected to
recognize the note under paragraph 815-15-25-4, whereby, there would be a separation into a host contract and derivative instrument.
The Company elected to initially and subsequently measure the note in its entirety at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized
in earnings. The derivative liability was adjusted periodically according to the stock price fluctuations.

Restricted
Stock CEO   

During

when the Company s market capitalization exceeded $10 million and the consolidated gross revenue, calculated in accordance
with GAAP, equaled or exceeded $10 million for the trailing twelve-month period. The Company issued 384,615 shares of common stock
to Mr. Nelson at fair value of $786,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014. If the Company s consolidated net profit,
calculated in accordance to GAAP, equals or exceeds $2 million for a trailing twelve-month period and the sooner of Mr. Nelson s

entity or an acquisition of the Company that results in the existing shareholders of the Company owning less than fifty percent
(50%) of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving entity following such transaction.

the Company will issue to each employee 12,821 shares of common stock and 64,105 shares in the aggregate; b) If the Company s
aggregate net income from operations, for any trailing four (4) quarters exceeds $3 million, the Company will issue each employee
12,821 shares of common stock and 64,105 shares in the aggregate; c) If the Company s aggregate net income from operations,
for any trailing four (4) quarters exceeds $4 million, the Company will issue each employee 12,820 and 51,280 shares in the aggregate.
Based on the probability that the first milestone would be achieved the Company recognized $33,000 in stock compensation expense
during the year 2015. As of September 30, 2016 the Company achieved each of the three milestones. During the quarter ended June
30, 2016 the Company issued 64,105 shares in aggregate associated with the first milestone. The issuance of the remaining 115,385
shares will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. The stock based compensation expense associated with the achievement
of the second and third milestones totaled $591,000 and was recognized in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. No additional
compensation expense will be required with the issuance of the 115,385 shares.  

Restricted
Shares to Former CFO   

On
February 1, 2015, the Company entered into a RSGA with its former Chief Financial Officer, intended to provide incentive to the
former CFO to ensure certain economic performance of the Company. All shares issuable under the RSGA are performance-based shares
and are valued as of the grant date at $4.21 per share. The RSGA provides for the issuance of up to 115,385 shares of the Company s
common stock provided certain milestones are met in certain stages as follows: a) If the Company s aggregate net income
from operations, for any trailing four (4) quarters equals or exceeds $2 million, the Company will issue 38,462 shares of common
stock; b) If the Company s aggregate net income from operations, for any trailing four (4) quarters exceeds $3 million,
the Company will issued 38,462 shares of common stock; c) If the Company s aggregate net income from operations, for any
trailing four (4) quarters exceeds $4 million, the Company will issue 38,461. As of September 30, 2016 the Company achieved each
of the three milestones. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016 the Company issued 38,462 shares associated with the first milestone.
The issuance of the remaining 76,723 shares will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. The stock based compensation
expense associated with the achievement of the second and third milestones totaled $324,000 and was recognized in the quarter
ended September 30, 2016. No additional compensation expense will be required with the issuance of the 76,723 shares.  

Under
the terms of the RSGA, the Company issued 379,491 shares of restricted common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
Another 746,157 shares of restricted common stock vested and remain to be issued. The total combined option and restricted stock
compensation expense recognized, in the statement of operations, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
$5,764,000 and $107,000 respectively.  

Warrants   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had 2,997,000 common stock purchase warrants outstanding with an exercise price of $4.15 per
share.

Business
Introduction / Overview   

We
provide photo voltaic ( PV ) based power systems for the commercial, agricultural and residential markets in California,
Nevada and Oregon. Through our operating subsidiaries, we design, arrange financing, integrate, install and manage systems ranging
in size from 2kW (kilowatt) for residential loads to multi MW (megawatt) systems for larger commercial or agricultural projects.
Commercial installations have included office buildings, manufacturing plants, and warehouses. Agricultural facilities include
farms, wineries and dairies. The Company provides a full range of installation services to our solar energy customers including
design, system engineering, procurement, permitting, construction, grid connection, warranty, system monitoring and maintenance.  

We
adhere to the business principles of:  

1.  
      Doing
    what is right for the customer;   

2.  
      Delivering
    the best value in our industry; and   

3.  
      Doing
    what we say we will do.   

Approximately fifty-seven percent (57%) of
our third quarter 2016 revenue ended September 30, 2016, was from sales to the commercial and agricultural market. Approximately
forty-three percent (43%) of our revenue was from sales to the residential market. 

Name
Change   

On
March 1, 2016, the Company changed its name from Solar3D, Inc. to Sunworks, Inc. with simultaneous NASDAQ stock symbol change
from SLTD to SUNW. Also, on February 26, 2016, the Company changed the name of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Solar United Network,
Inc. to Sunworks United, Inc.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and fair value
computation using the Black Scholes option pricing model. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions, such as the trading value of our common stock and estimated future undiscounted cash flows, that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates, including those for the above-described items, are reasonable.

Additionally,
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenues
and related costs on construction contracts are recognized using the  percentage of completion method  of accounting
in accordance with Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts ( ASC 605-35 ).
Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct
proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct
material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general
and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred. However, in the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company
recognizes the loss, as it is determined. The Asset,  Costs in excess of billings , represents revenues recognized
in excess of amounts billed on contracts in progress. The Liability,  Billings in excess of costs , represents billings
in excess of revenues recognized on contracts in progress.  

At
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the costs in excess of billings balance was $8,108,000 and $1,972,000 and the billings in excess
of costs balance was $3,800,000 and $1,366,000 respectively.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Three
months of Sunworks United (f/k/a Solar United Network), MD Energy and Plan B operations were consolidated into the Company s
financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016. Three months of Sunworks and MD Energy operations were consolidated
into the Company s financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2015.  

REVENUE
AND COST OF SALES  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenue for the Company declined to $17,563,000 compared to $19,730,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $12,827,000 compared to $14,400,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenues and cost of sales decreased primarily due to procedural delays in receiving
various approvals from authorities that have jurisdiction for larger commercial and agricultural contracts. These authorities
include Federal, state and county governments and electrical utilities. These authorities include the Army Corp of Engineers for
installations in areas designated as being flood plains. Approvals are pending from the Division of State Architecture for projects
on school sites. Other projects are awaiting approvals for utility or transformer upgrades from Pacific Gas   Electric and
other electrical service providers. As Sunworks  geographical footprint expands, each county has its own unique requirements
some more intricate to comply with than other counties. The delays are considered temporary and result in these project revenues
being pushed into future months.  

Gross profit for the Company declined to $4,736,000
compared to $5,330,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The gross margin percentage was 26.9%
in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 27.0% in the same quarter of 2015. Commercial jobs were 57% of sales in the third quarter
of 2016 compared to 65% of sales in the same period the prior year. Commercial jobs in general have lower gross profit margins
compared to residential jobs. The decrease in gross margin percentage is the result of a combination of labor and subcontracted
costs being expensed as period costs compared to prior quarters. As jobs are delayed by a lack of governmental approvals or weather,
direct labor and subcontractor efficiencies drop. While material prices are declining the realization of the benefit is delayed
as the company completes utilizing its higher-cost existing inventories.

SELLING
AND MARKETING EXPENSES  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company had selling and marketing or S M expenses of $2,145,000 compared to $1,835,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. S M expenses increased primarily due to increases in media advertising expenses and in commercial sales related
personnel costs. During the third quarter, the decision was made to shift the focus of the residential sales effort from media
advertising and from staffing a call center to a direct sales approach. The call center was closed and new media advertising was
significantly reduced. The larger portion of these cost reductions will not be experienced until the 4 th  quarter. We
have substantially increased the number of commercial and agricultural sales team members and their compensation. As a percentage
of revenue, S M expenses were 12% of third quarter revenues in 2016 compared to 9% in the third quarter of 2015. We have specially-designed
marketing efforts and tracking systems in place that enable us to attract new customers at a lower cost and higher conversion
rate than what we believe to be the industry average. This same tracking system also helps to identify which marketing efforts
are productive and was a basis for determining that the residential direct sales marketing approach may be more cost effective. 

GENERAL
AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  

Total general and administrative or G A
expenses increased to $4,250,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,744,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Some of the increase in G A expenses was due to the costs associated with acquisition of Elite Solar.
Furthermore, there are additional costs associated with opening four new offices, additional personnel, vehicles, insurance and
a variety of professional expenses driven by the significant organic growth realized by the Sunworks operations compared to the
prior year. As a percentage of revenue, G A expenses increased to 24% in the third quarter compared to 9% in the third quarter
of 2015. Certain G A expenses are fixed costs, over the short term which results in a the costs being a higher percentage
of revenue when calculated based upon a lower revenue amount. 

With
each acquisition, we also look to transition most back office functions to our corporate headquarters to control costs and make
our operations consistent across our subsidiaries. We believe that the strategy of centralizing certain functions such as purchasing,
supplier relations, accounting, human resources and other basic functions help to more effectively support operations, realize
strategic synergies and reduce the need to increase costs as sales continue to grow.  

STOCK
BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred $3,902,000 in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The majority or
$3,752,000 of the non-cash stock compensation expense is the result of the Company meeting the second and third milestones of
the 2014 Restricted Stock Grant Agreements for the Sunworks United employees and includes restricted shares for the former CFO.
The respective performance milestones that were achieved include reaching $3 million and $4 million in aggregate net income from
operations for the trailing four (4) quarters. With the achievement of these final two milestones, the Company will issue an additional
746,157 shares of common stock in the aggregate. The weighted average value of the shares expensed during the quarter is calculated
as of the 2014 and 2015 historical grant dates. The historical grant date weighted-average value is $5.03 per share.  

Approximately
$14,000 of additional stock based compensation was expensed for the August 31, 2016 grant of 250,000 restricted shares to the
CEO at the per share value at the date of grant of $2.90. This grant is being expensed on a straight-line basis over 52 months.  

Stock
based compensation related to the employee options totaled $135,000 during the quarter. This compares to $32,000 in non-cash stock
based compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to stock options.  

RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT  

Research
and development costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and $6,000 respectively. These costs were
associated with research and patent work for a 3-dimensional solar cell. The novel 3D cell is theoretically superior to conventional
panels but is still in the development stage, needing to be manufactured and field tested on a larger scale. Whether the Company
can find a PV panel manufacturer willing to invest the time and productive resources to manufacture such panels is unknown.  

NET
(LOSS) INCOME BEFORE OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES)  

Net
(loss) before other income (expenses) for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016, was $5,662,000 compared to a net income
of $1,703,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The significant decrease year over year was primarily the result
of the recognition of $3,902,000 of non-cash stock based compensation, higher selling and marketing costs, general and administrative
costs and lower commercial sale revenues. The commercial revenues declined as the result of delays in receiving governmental and
utility approvals necessary to allow for the installation, completion and connection of several larger commercial jobs.  

OTHER
INCOME/(EXPENSES)  

Other
expenses were $423,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $301,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Interest expense for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016, decreased to $209,000 from $301,000 for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is attributable to the conversion of a 4% interest-bearing convertible note to common stock
in November 2015. The remaining interest expense is largely due to non-cash debt discount amortization treated as interest for
the same convertible promissory notes in both quarters.  

Table
of Contents   

NET
(LOSS) INCOME   

The
net (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $6,085,000 compared to net income of $1,402,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net income is also the result of revenues for the quarter being $2,167,000 less than
the prior year, while sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses have grown to support higher sales volumes and
geographical expansion.  

Included
in the quarterly net loss is $3,902,000 of non-cash stock based compensation. $3,752,000 of the non-cash stock compensation expense
is a one-time expense due to the 2014   2015 Restricted Stock Grant Agreements performance targets being achieved in the second
quarter and vesting in the third current quarter.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Nine
months of Sunworks United (f/k/a Solar United Network), MD Energy and Plan B operations were consolidated into the Company s
financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016. Nine months of Sunworks and eight months of MD Energy operations
were consolidated into the Company s financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2015.  

REVENUE
AND COST OF SALES  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenue for the Company grew to $67,981,000 or 87% compared to $36,394,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of sales for the nine months of 2016 was $48,156,000 compared to $25,670,000 for the nine
months of 2015. Revenue and cost of sales increased primarily due to the addition of the Plan B operation acquired plus significant
organic growth realized by the Sunworks United operations compared to the prior year. Substantial efforts have been made year
over year to drive sales primarily in the commercial and agricultural markets.  

Gross
profit for the Company grew to $19,825,000. This is an increase of 85% compared to $10,724,000 for the nine months of 2016 and
2015, respectively. The gross margin percentage is nearly unchanged at 29% in the nine months of 2016 compared to 29% for the
nine months of 2015 even with a higher percentage of commercial versus residential jobs. Commercial jobs in general have smaller
gross profit margins compared to residential jobs.  

SELLING
AND MARKETING EXPENSES  

For
the nine months of 2016, the Company incurred S M expenses of $7,932,000, compared to $5,179,000 for the nine months of 2015.
Overall S M expenses increased primarily due to increases in media advertising, additional personnel and call center related
expenses. As a percentage of revenues S M expenses decreased to 12% in the nine months of 2016 compared to 14% in the nine
months of 2015. We have specially-designed marketing efforts and tracking systems in place that enable us to attract new customers
at a lower cost and higher conversion rate than what we believe to be the industry average. We utilize several marketing tools
and business strategies to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and attract new customers.  

GENERAL
AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  

G A
expenses increased to $10,322,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $4,534,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. G A expenses increased primarily due to the cost associated with the Plan B operations that were acquired
plus expenses required to generate and administer the significant organic growth realized by the Sunworks United operations compared
to the prior year. On a percentage of revenue, G A expenses increased to 15% of revenues in the nine months of 2016 compared
to 12% in the nine months of 2015. Some G A expenses are fixed costs which result in a lower percentage when spread over a
higher revenue amount.  

Several new initiatives also increased costs
in the nine months of 2016 compared to 2015. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, rebranding the company, adding
personnel and systems necessary to build more efficient front and back office operations. The Company added locations, personnel
and vehicles to expand both residential and commercial operations. New offices include Chico and the South Bay area of California,
White City, Oregon. A commercial office in Turlock, California was also added.

STOCK
BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES  

In
the nine months of 2016 we incurred approximately $5,764,000 in non-cash stock compensation costs associated with RSGAs and options
compared to $107,000 in the prior period. This 2016 amount was due to meeting the three milestones of the 2014 Restricted Stock
Grant Agreements for the Sunworks United employees and our former CFO. The milestones were the achievement of $2 million, $3 million
and $4 million in aggregate net income from operations for trailing four (4) quarters. To date, the Company issued 379,491 shares
of common stock in the aggregate during the nine months of 2016 following the achievement of the first of the three milestones.
With the achievement of the final two milestones, the Company will issue an additional 746,157 shares of common stock in the aggregate.
The weighted average value of the shares expensed during the year is calculated as of the 2014 and 2015 historical grant dates.
The historical grant date weighted-average value is $5.03 per share. This compares to $107,000 in non-cash stock compensation
expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to stock options.  

RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT  

Research
and development costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and $53,000 respectively. These costs were
associated with research and patent work for a 3-dimensional solar cell. The novel 3D cell is theoretically superior to conventional
panels but is still in the development stage, needing to be manufactured and field tested on a larger scale. Whether the Company
can find a PV panel manufacturer willing to invest the time and productive resources to manufacture such panels is unknown.  

NET
(LOSS) INCOME BEFORE OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES)  

Net
(loss) before other income (expenses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $4,408,000 compared to a net income of
$825,000 for the nine months of 2015. The $5,233,000 decrease in results year over year is primarily the result the year-to-date
stock compensation expense of $5,764,000.  

OTHER
INCOME/(EXPENSES)  

Other
expenses increased to $1,312,000 for the nine months of 2016, compared to $948,000 for the nine months of 2015. Interest expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased to $763,000 from $1,023,000 for the first nine months of 2015, primarily
due to a reduction in non-cash debt discount and amortization treated as interest for convertible promissory notes for both years.  

NET
(LOSS) INCOME   

Net
(loss) for the nine months of 2016, was $5,720,000 compared to a net (loss) of $123,000 for the nine months of 2015. While sales
grew 87% with the addition of Plan B operations and organic growth, the decrease in net income was primarily the result of the
$5,543,000 non-cash stock based compensation that the Company was required to recognize under the terms of the 2014 and 2015 Restricted
Stock Grants. The expense is being recognized at the weighted average grant date share value of $5.03 per share, well above the
current share price.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

We
had $6,661,000 in cash at September 30, 2016, as compared to $12,040,000 at December 31, 2015. We believe that the aggregate of
our existing cash, in addition to the funds available under our Credit Agreements and funds expected to be generated from accounts
receivable will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  

As
of September 30, 2016, our working capital surplus was $12,786,000 compared to a working capital surplus of $11,674,000 at December
31, 2015.  

Cash
flow used in operating activities was $2,711,000 for the nine months of 2016, compared to $1,794,000 used in the nine months of
2015. This cash used in operating activities during the nine months of 2016 was primarily attributable to higher costs in excess
of billings, accounts receivable, and inventory partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities and billings
in excess of costs.  

Cash
used in investing activities was $644,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $982,000 used in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. In 2016 our investing was primarily for property, plant and equipment compared to primarily acquisition
related in the nine months of 2015.  

Table
of Contents   

Net
cash used from financing activities during the nine months of 2016 was $2,024,000 resulting from net reductions in borrowing compared
to the nine months of 2015 where we generated $11,621,000 in net cash. The cash generated in 2015 was due to equity financing
through the issuance of 3 million new common shares.  

On
December 31, 2015, we entered into a $2.5 million Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Availability under the Credit
Facility is a Line of Credit with a Letter of Credit Sublimit up to $2.5 million. The Company had zero outstanding at September
30, 2016 compared to $1.8 million that was drawn on December 31, 2015 and repaid in 2016. The Credit Facility matures on November
30, 2017, but may be cancelled at any time by the Company. Loans are secured by a security interest in the Company s account
held with the Lender. Interest on any unpaid balance accrues at the Prime Rate; provided that, on any given day, shall not be
less than the Adjusted One Month LIBOR rate. Until the maturity date, the Company shall pay monthly interest only. While we currently

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Pursuant
to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15-d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), the Company
carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer ( CEO/CFO ) of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. The term  disclosure controls and procedures , as defined
under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.  

As
disclosed in our annual report filing for the year ended December 31, 2015, there was a material weakness in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting due to the fact that the Company had a lack of segregation of duties and failure to
implement accounting controls of acquired businesses. Based upon the evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures at the
end of the period covered by this report, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

To
address the material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure our
consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q fairly
present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15f of the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

Limitations
on Internal Controls   

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
