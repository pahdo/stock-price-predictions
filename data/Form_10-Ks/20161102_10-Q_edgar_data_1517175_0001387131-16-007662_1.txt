 (unaudited) 
(Amounts in thousands, except share amounts and per share data)  

Note 1  
      Operations and Basis of Presentation   
 
   Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   

 The financial statements include the consolidated accounts
of The Chefs  Warehouse, Inc. (the  Company ), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company s quarterly
periods end on the thirteenth Friday of each quarter. Every six to seven years the Company will add a fourteenth week to its fourth
quarter to more closely align its year end to the calendar year. Fiscal 2016 will include a fourteenth week in the fourth quarter.
The Company operates in one reportable segment, food product distribution, which is concentrated on the East and West Coasts of
the United States. The Company s customer base consists primarily of menu-driven independent restaurants, fine dining establishments,
country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, cruise lines, casinos and specialty food
stores. 

   Consolidation   

 The consolidated financial statements include all the
accounts of the Company and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. 

   Unaudited Interim Financial Statements   

 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and the related interim information contained within the notes to such unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP )
and the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim information and quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2015 filed as part of the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016. 

 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
appearing in this Form 10-Q have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016, and in the opinion of management include
all normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for the fair statement of the Company s interim period results. The year-end
condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures
required by GAAP. Due to seasonal fluctuations and other factors, the results of operations for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks
ended September 23, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from management s estimates. 

Reclassification   

 Changes have been made to the prior period presentation
in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income to conform to the current period presentation.
Amounts previously included in operating expenses are now included in net sales and cost of sales and amounts previously included
in sales have been netted against cost of sales. The impact of these reclassifications is included below: 

New Accounting Pronouncements   

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. This guidance includes the required steps
to achieve the core principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
On August 12, 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after that date. Early adoption of ASU 2014-09 is permitted but not before the original effective date (annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The Company expects to adopt this guidance when effective and is still evaluating the
impact this standard will have on its financial statements. 

 In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify
the subsequent measurement of inventory. This new guidance provides that inventory should be measured at lower of cost or net realizable
value. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017 and is required to be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted at the beginning of an
interim or annual reporting period. The Company expects to adopt this guidance when effective and adoption is not expected to have
a material effect on the financial statements. 

 In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify
the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax
assets and liabilities into current and non-current classifications. This guidance requires that all deferred tax liabilities be
classified as non-current. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be applied on
a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
The Company expects to adopt this guidance when effective and adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial
statements. 

 In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance to increase
the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Current GAAP does not require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities
arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance when effective and is evaluating the impact this
standard will have on its financial statements. 

 In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify
the accounting for stock compensation. This guidance requires that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recognized as income
tax expense in the period in which they occur and that they be reflected as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows.
Current GAAP requires excess tax benefits to be recognized as additional paid in capital and as a financing activity in the statement
of cash flows. In addition, the guidance gives companies the option of estimating the number of awards that will ultimately vest
or accounting for forfeitures as they occur. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance when effective and is evaluating the impact this standard will
have on its financial statements. 

 In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance to
clarify how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including
contingent consideration payments made after a business acquisition and debt extinguishment costs. Specifically, cash payments
to settle a contingent consideration liability which are not made soon after the acquisition date should be classified as
cash used in financing activities up to the initial amount of contingent consideration recognized with the remaining
amount classified as cash flows from operating activities. The guidance will be effective for the Company's annual and
interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this
guidance when effective and adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Guidance Adopted in 2016   

  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs .
In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires that debt issuance costs
related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that
debt liability. We adopted this guidance retrospectively during the first quarter of 2016. As a result of adopting this guidance,
total assets and total liabilities as of December 25, 2015 decreased as follows. 

Note 2  
      Earnings (Loss) Per Share   
 
 The following table sets forth the computation of basic
and diluted net income (loss) per share: 

Reconciliation of net income (loss) per common share: 

The weighted average shares outstanding for the thirteen
and thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016 did not include the impact of 158,539 and 309,922 Restricted Share Awards (RSAs),
respectively, or 1,237,374 shares from the convertible subordinated notes issued in connection with our acquisition of Del Monte
Capitol Meat Co. and certain related entities ( Del Monte ) as they were deemed to be anti-dilutive. The weighted average
shares outstanding for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015 did not include the impact of 45,106 RSAs as they were deemed
to be anti-dilutive. 

Note 3  
      Fair Value Measurements; Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 
 We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair
value. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of the following three levels based on the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety: 

 Level
1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 

Level
2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities include the following: 

a)  
      quoted prices for similar assets in active markets;   

b)  
      quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets;   

c)  
      inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and   

d)  
      inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   
 
 If the asset has a specified (contractual) term, the
Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset. 

 Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation
methodology are unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity) and significant to the fair value measure. 

   Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value   

 As of September 23, 2016, the Company s only
assets or liabilities measured at fair value were the contingent earn-out liabilities for the Del Monte and the M.T. Food Service,
Inc. ( MT Food ) acquisitions. These liabilities were estimated using Level 3 inputs and had fair values of $13,661
and $500 at September 23, 2016, respectively. These liabilities are reflected as accrued liabilities and other liabilities and
deferred credits on the balance sheet. The fair value of contingent consideration for the Del Monte acquisition was determined
based on a probability-based approach which includes projected results, percentage probability of occurrence and the application
of a discount rate to present value the payments. A significant change in projected results, discount rate, or probabilities of
occurrence could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Based on the short duration of the earn-out
period, the fair value of the contingent consideration for the MT Food acquisition was determined based on management s assessment
of the likelihood of achievement. On July 8, 2016, the Company and the former owners of Allen Brothers, reached an agreement and
paid $2,660 to settle the remaining earn-out payments related to the Allen Brothers acquisition. 

 On September 30, 2016, the Company made an earn-out
payment of $4,083 to the former owners of Del Monte (see Note 13). 

 The following table presents the changes in Level 3
contingent consideration liability: 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

 The carrying amounts reported in the Company s
consolidated balance sheets for accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value, due to the immediate to short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. The fair values of the current and former revolving credit facilities and term loans approximated
their book values as of September 23, 2016 and December 25, 2015, as these instruments had variable interest rates that reflected
current market rates available to the Company. The carrying amount of the Company s senior secured notes at December 25,
2015 approximates fair value, as the interest rate obtained by the Company approximates the prevailing interest rates available
to the Company for similar instruments. The fair value of these debt instruments were estimated using Level 3 inputs. 

 The following table presents the carrying value and
fair value of the Company s convertible subordinated notes. In estimating the fair value of these convertible secured notes,
the Company utilized Level 3 inputs including, prevailing market interest rates to estimate the debt portion of the instrument
and a Black Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the conversion option. The Black Scholes model utilizes the market
price of the Company s common stock, estimates of the stock s volatility and the prevailing risk free interest rate
in calculating the fair value estimate. 

Note 4  
      Acquisitions   
 
 The Company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with
ASC 805  Business Combinations . Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Results of operations are included in the Company s financial
statements from the date of acquisition. For the acquisitions noted below, the Company used the income approach to determine the
fair value of the customer relationships, the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of trademarks and the comparison
of economic income using the with/without approach to determine the fair value of non-compete agreements. 

 On June 26, 2016, the Company acquired
substantially all of the assets of MT Food, based in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in the mid 1990's, MT Food is a wholesale
distributor of dairy, produce, specialty and grocery items in the metro Chicago area. The purchase price for the transaction
was $21,500, of which, $21,000 was paid in cash at closing with an additional $500 payable eighteen months after the closing
date. The aggregate purchase price paid by the Company was paid through cash-on-hand and the proceeds from a draw down on its
delayed draw term loan facility (see Note 8). The final purchase price is subject to a customary working capital true-up. The
Company will also pay additional contingent consideration, if earned, in the form of an earn-out amount which totals $500 to
MT Food; the payment of the earn-out liability is subject to certain conditions, including the successful achievement of
Gross Profit targets for the MT Food entity during the period between the acquisition date and the date the MT Food
operations are transferred to the Company s existing Chicago facility, not to exceed one year. As of the acquisition
date, the Company estimated that this contingent consideration would be fully met and established a $500 contingent
consideration liability. This contingent liability will be adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis and is estimated to be
$500 at September 23, 2016. The Company is in the process of finalizing a valuation of the tangible and intangible assets of
MT Food as of the acquisition date. These assets will be valued at fair value using Level 3 inputs. Other intangible assets
are expected to be amortized over 5-15 years. Goodwill for the MT Food acquisition will be amortized over 15 years for tax
purposes. For the thirteen weeks ended September 23, 2016, the Company reflected net revenues and income before taxes of
$15,620 and $992, respectively for MT Food in its condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

 On April 6, 2015, the Company acquired substantially
all the equity interests of Del Monte Capitol Meat Co. and substantially all the assets of certain of its affiliated companies
(collectively  Del Monte ). Del Monte supplies high quality USDA inspected beef, pork, lamb, veal, poultry and seafood
products to Northern California. The aggregate purchase price paid by the Company was approximately $184,074. Approximately $123,893
was paid in cash initially, through cash-on-hand, the proceeds from the issuance of additional senior secured notes and additional
borrowings under the revolving portion of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as defined below). The remaining approximately
$61,439 consisted of (i) approximately 1.1 million shares of the Company s common stock totaling approximately $24,689 and
(ii) $36,750 in aggregate principal amounts of convertible subordinated notes with a six-year maturity bearing interest at 2.5%
with a conversion price of $29.70 per share issued to certain of the Del Monte entities. The Company will also pay additional contingent
consideration, if earned, in the form of an earn-out amount which could total approximately $24,500 to certain of the Del Monte
entities; the payment of the earn-out liability is subject to certain conditions, including the successful achievement of Adjusted
EBITDA targets for the Del Monte entities and improvements in certain operating metrics for the Company s existing protein
business and the business of any protein companies subsequently acquired by the Company over the six years following the closing
of the Del Monte acquisition. At April 6, 2015, the Company estimated the fair value of this contingent earn-out liability to be

by entering into a new senior secured term loan. The Company used the proceeds to pay down its revolving credit facility of $96,400,
its previous term loan of $1,681 and its senior secured notes of $125,000. The revolving credit facility and previous term loan
were originally due in April 2017. The senior secured notes had maturities of $50,000 in April 2018, $25,000 in October 2020 and
$50,000 in April 2023. The Company was required to pay the senior note holders make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early
retirement of these notes. In addition, the Company wrote off deferred financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured
notes, term loan, and revolving credit facility. The refinancing met the requirements of a debt extinguishment for accounting purposes
and the loss on extinguishment of debt of $22,310, inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees,
is reflected in interest expense. 

  Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility  

 On June 22, 2016, the Company entered into a credit
agreement (the  Term Loan Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders for which Jefferies Finance LLC ( Jefferies )
acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan B facility
(the  Term Loan Facility ) in an aggregate amount of $305,000 with a $50,000 six-month delayed draw term loan facility
(the  DDTL  the loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility (including the DDTL), the  Term Loans ).
Additionally, the Term Loan Facility includes an accordion which permits the Company to request that the lenders extend additional
Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50,000 (less the aggregate amount of certain indebtedness incurred to finance
acquisitions) plus an unlimited amount subject to the Company s Total Leverage Ratio not exceeding 4.90:1.00 on a pro forma
basis. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used to repay the Company s senior secured notes, as well as the prior
term loan and revolving credit facility. Remaining funds will be used for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working
capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. On June 27, 2016, the Company drew $14,000 from the DDTL to help pay for
the MT Food acquisition. On September 14, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement under which
the remaining portion of the DDTL was terminated, the Company s interest rate schedule was modified and the Company repaid
$25,000 of the outstanding balance of the Term Loans. The interest rate on this facility at September 23, 2016 was 6.75%. 

 The final maturity of the Term Loan Facility is June
22, 2022. Subject to adjustment for prepayments, the Company is required to make quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loans
in an amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans. 

 The interest rates per annum applicable to Term Loans,
will be, at the co-borrowers  option, equal to either a base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three, six or (if
consented to by the lenders) twelve-month interest periods chosen by the Company, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage.
A commitment fee is payable in respect of the amount of the undrawn DDTL commitments during the period the DDTL is available, equal
to a percentage equal to 50% of the interest rate with respect to Term Loans accruing interest based on the adjusted LIBO rate. 

 The Term Loan Facility contains customary affirmative
covenants, negative covenants (including restrictions, subject to customary exceptions, on incurring debt or liens, paying dividends,
repaying payment subordinated and junior lien debt, disposing assets, and making investments and acquisitions), and events of default
for a term loan B facility of this type, as more particularly described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. 

Asset Based Loan Facility  

 On June 22, 2016, the Company entered into a   credit
agreement (the  ABL Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders for which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acts as administrative
agent and collateral agent. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for an asset based loan facility (the  ABL Facility )
in the aggregate amount of up to $75,000. Availability under the ABL Facility will be limited to a borrowing base consisting of
the difference of (a) the lesser of: (i) the aggregate amount of commitments or (ii) the sum of specified percentages
of eligible receivables and eligible inventory, minus certain availability reserves minus (b) outstanding borrowings. The co-borrowers
under the ABL Facility are entitled on one or more occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an
increase in the commitments under the ABL Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25,000. The ABL Facility matures
on June 22, 2021. 

 The interest rates per annum applicable to loans, other
than swingline loans, under the ABL Credit Facility will be, at the co-borrowers  option, equal to either a base rate or
an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month, interest periods chosen by the
Company, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. The Company will pay certain recurring fees with respect to the ABL
Facility, including fees on the unused commitments of the lenders. 

 The ABL Facility contains customary affirmative covenants,
negative covenants and events of default as more particularly described in the ABL Credit Agreement. The ABL Facility will require
compliance with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 if the amount of availability under the ABL Facility
falls below a specified dollar amount or percentage of the borrowing base. 

 There were no outstanding balances under the ABL as
of September 23, 2016. Borrowings under the ABL Facility will be used, and are expected to be used, for capital expenditures, permitted
acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. As of September 23, 2016, the Company was in compliance
with all debt covenants and the Company had reserved $7,670 of the ABL facility for the issuance of letters of credit. As of September
23, 2016, funds totaling $67,330 were available for borrowing under the ABL facility. 

Note 9  
      Stockholders  Equity   
 
 During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016,
the Company granted 186,969 restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) to its employees and independent directors at a weighted
average grant date fair value of $18.47 each. These awards are a mix of time and performance based grants which will vest over
periods of two to four years. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016, the Company recognized expense
totaling $110 and $357 on these RSAs, and $309 and $1,160 of expense for RSAs issued in prior years. 

 During March 2016, the Company granted 259,577 non-qualified
stock options with market condition provisions to its employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $9.44 each. These
awards vest over a period of three years and require the Company s stock to trade at or above $30 per share for 20 consecutive
days within four years of issuance to meet the market condition threshold. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September
23, 2016, the Company recognized expense totaling $120 and $392 on these options, respectively. 

 At September 23, 2016, the Company had 309,922 unvested
RSAs outstanding. At September 23, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost for these unvested RSAs was $4,921 and the weighted-average
remaining useful life was approximately 20 months. Of this total, $3,596 related to RSAs with time-based vesting provisions and
$1,325 related to RSAs with performance-based vesting provisions. At September 23, 2016, the weighted-average remaining useful
lives for time-based vesting RSAs and performance-based vesting RSAs were both approximately 20 months. No compensation expense
related to the Company s RSAs has been capitalized. 

 As of September 23, 2016, there were 603,789 shares
available for grant under the Company s 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan.

      Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information   

Note 12  
      Commitments and Contingencies   
 
 Until February 29, 2016, the Company sublet a distribution
facility from Leasing (an entity controlled by the Company s founders). Leasing leases the distribution center from the
New York City Industrial Development Agency. In connection with this sublease arrangement and Leasing s obligations under
a related mortgage to its mortgage lender, the Company, Dairyland and another of the Company s subsidiaries initially were
required to act as guarantors of Leasing s mortgage obligation on the distribution center. The mortgage payoff date is December
2029 and the potential obligation under this guarantee totaled $5,362 at September 23, 2016. By agreement dated July 1, 2005,
the lender released the Company and its subsidiaries from their guaranty obligations, provided the sublease between Dairyland
and Leasing remained in full force and effect. As of February 29, 2016, Dairyland exited the sublease arrangement with Leasing,
triggering the guarantee obligation. The Company believes that the fair value of the building securing the mortgage more than
offsets any potential obligation. In addition, Leasing is in the process of refinancing its mortgage with another lender. The
Company, upon completion of the refinancing, expects that the Company and its subsidiaries will be unconditionally and fully released
from any guaranty of Leasing s mortgage loan.

financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in our financial condition
and results of operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with information included in our Annual Report

  OVERVIEW  

 We are a premier distributor of specialty foods in
eight of the leading culinary markets in the United States. We offer more than 35,000 SKUs, ranging from high-quality specialty
foods and ingredients to basic ingredients and staples and center-of-the-plate proteins. We serve more than 26,500 customer locations,
primarily located in our 15 geographic markets across the United States and Canada, and the majority of our customers are independent
restaurants and fine dining establishments. As a result of our acquisition of Allen Brothers, we also sell certain of our center-of-the-plate
products directly to consumers. 

 We believe several key differentiating factors of our
business model have enabled us to execute our strategy consistently and profitably across our expanding customer base. These factors
consist of a portfolio of distinctive and hard-to-find specialty food products, an extensive selection of center-of-the-plate proteins,
a highly trained and motivated sales force, strong sourcing capabilities, a fully integrated warehouse management system, a highly
sophisticated distribution and logistics platform and a focused, seasoned management team. 

 In recent years, our sales to existing and new customers
have increased through the continued growth in demand for specialty food products and center-of-the-plate products in general;
increased market share driven by our large percentage of sophisticated and experienced sales professionals, our high-quality customer
service and our extensive breadth and depth of product offerings, including, as a result of our acquisitions of Michael s
in August 2012, Allen Brothers in December 2013 and Del Monte in April 2015, meat, seafood and other center-of-the-plate products,
and, as a result of our acquisition of Qzina in May 2013, gourmet chocolate, pastries and dessert; the acquisition of other specialty
food and center-of-the-plate distributors; the expansion of our existing distribution centers; our entry into new distribution
centers, including the construction of a new distribution center and our acquisition of MT Food in Chicago; and the import and
sale of our proprietary brands. Through these efforts, we believe that we have been able to expand our customer base, enhance and
diversify our product selections, broaden our geographic penetration and increase our market share. 

  RECENT ACQUISITIONS  

 On June 27, 2016 the Company acquired
substantially all the assets of M.T. Foodservice, Inc. ( MT Food ), a specialty food distributor based out of
Chicago, IL. The purchase price for the transaction was $21,500 of which $21,000 was paid in cash at closing and an
additional $500 payable eighteen months after the closing date. The selling price may be increased by an additional $500
provided certain performance metrics are met in the post-acquisition period. The final purchase price is subject to a
customary working capital true-up. 

 On April 6, 2015, we acquired substantially all the
equity interests of Del Monte Capitol Meat Co. and substantially all the assets of certain of its affiliated companies (collectively,
 Del Monte ) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $184,074. Founded in 1926, Del Monte supplies high quality,
USDA inspected beef, pork, lamb, veal, poultry and seafood products to Northern California. The funding of the acquisition consisted
of the following: 

$123,893 was paid in cash initially, through cash-on-hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of $25,000 of additional senior secured notes. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company finalized the net working capital adjustment as included in the initial purchase agreement and in July 2016 received $1,258 out of escrow;   

approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock (valued at $22.17 per share); and  

$36,750 in convertible subordinated notes issued to certain entities affiliated with Del Monte with a six-year maturity bearing interest at 2.50% with a conversion price of $29.70 per share.   
 
 In addition, we have agreed to pay additional contingent
consideration of up to $24,500 upon the successful achievement of Adjusted EBITDA targets for the Del Monte entities and improvements
in certain operating metrics for our existing protein business and the business of any protein companies subsequently acquired
by the Company over the six years following the closing. On September 30, 2016, the Company paid $4,083 to the former owners of
Del Monte in consideration for Del Monte achieving its year-one EBITDA target. 

Our Growth Strategies and Outlook   

 We continue to invest in our people, facilities and
technology in an effort to achieve the following objectives and maintain our premier position within the specialty foodservice
distribution market: 

sales and service territory expansion;   

operational excellence and high customer service levels;   

expanded purchasing programs and improved buying power;   

product innovation and new product category introduction;   

operational efficiencies through system enhancements; and   

operating expense reduction through the centralization of general and administrative functions.   
 
 Our growth has allowed us to improve upon our organization s
infrastructure, open new distribution facilities and pursue selective acquisitions. Over the last several years, we have increased
our distribution capacity to approximately 1.2 million square feet in 22 distribution facilities at September 23, 2016. From the
second half of fiscal 2013 through the first nine months of fiscal 2016, we have invested significantly in acquisitions, infrastructure
and management. 

   Key Factors Affecting Our Performance   

 Due to our focus on menu-driven independent restaurants,
fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, cruise lines,
casinos and specialty food stores, our results of operations are materially impacted by the success of the food-away-from-home
industry in the United States and Canada, which is materially impacted by general economic conditions, weather, discretionary spending
levels and consumer confidence. When economic conditions deteriorate, our customers businesses are negatively impacted as fewer
people eat away-from-home and those who do spend less money. As economic conditions begin to improve, our customers  businesses
historically have likewise improved, which contributes to improvements in our business. Likewise, the direct to consumer business
of our Allen Brothers subsidiary is significantly dependent on consumers  discretionary spending habits, and weakness or
uncertainty in the economy could lead to consumers buying less from Allen Brothers. 

 Volatile food costs may have a direct impact upon our
profitability. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and results of operations
to the extent we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers. In addition, product cost
inflation may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending decisions within our customers  establishments, which could
adversely impact our sales. Conversely, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even
though our gross profit as a percentage of sales may remain relatively constant. However, some of our products, particularly certain
of our protein items, are priced on a cost plus a dollar markup, which helps mitigate the negative impact of deflation. 

 Given our wide selection of product categories, as
well as the continuous introduction of new products, we can experience shifts in product sales mix that have an impact on net sales
and gross profit margins. This mix shift is most significantly impacted by the introduction of new categories of products in markets
that we have more recently entered, the shift in product mix resulting from acquisitions, as well as the continued growth in item
penetration on higher velocity items such as dairy products. 

 The foodservice distribution industry is fragmented
but consolidating, and we have supplemented our internal growth through selective strategic acquisitions. We believe that the consolidation
trends in the foodservice distribution industry will continue to present acquisition opportunities for us, which may allow us to
grow our business at a faster pace than we would otherwise be able to grow the business organically. 

 On June 22, 2016, the Company refinanced its
debt structure by entering into a new senior secured term loan. The Company used the proceeds to pay down the revolving
credit facility of $96,400, the previous term loan of $1,681 and the senior secured notes of $125,000. The revolving credit
facility and previous term loan were originally due in April 2017. The senior secured notes had maturities of $50,000 in
April 2018, $25,000 in October 2020 and $50,000 in April 2023. The Company was required to pay the senior note holders
make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early retirement of these notes. In addition, the Company wrote off deferred
financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured notes, term loan, and revolving credit facility. The
refinancing met the requirements of a debt extinguishment for accounting purposes and the loss on extinguishment of debt of
$22,310, inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees, is reflected in interest expense. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The following table presents, for the periods indicated,
certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales: 

Management evaluates the results of operations and cash
flows using a variety of key performance indicators, including net sales compared to prior periods and internal forecasts, costs
of our products and results of our cost-control initiatives, and use of operating cash. These indicators are discussed throughout
the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this MD A. 

  Thirteen Weeks Ended September 23, 2016 Compared
to Thirteen Weeks Ended September 25, 2015  

   Net Sales   

 Our net sales for the thirteen weeks
ended September 23, 2016 increased approximately 7.8%, or $21,611, to $297,917 from $276,306 for the thirteen weeks ended
September 25, 2015. Organic growth contributed $5,992, or 2.2% to sales growth in the quarter. The remaining sales growth of
$15,619, or 5.7% resulted from the acquisition of MT Food on June 27, 2016. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, the
Company s case count grew approximately 7.5%, while the number of unique customers and placements grew 5.2% and 5.6%,
respectively, in the core specialty business in the third quarter of 2016. Pounds sold in our protein division decreased 1.8%
for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year quarter. Internally calculated deflation was approximately 2.2%
during the quarter, consisting of 1.6% deflation in our specialty division and deflation of 3.2% in our protein
division. 

   Gross Profit   

 Gross profit increased approximately 6.0%, or $4,220,
to $74,392 for the thirteen weeks ended September 23, 2016, from $70,172 for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2015. Gross
profit margin decreased approximately 43 basis points to 25.0% from 25.4%. Gross profit margins increased approximately 11 basis
points in the Company s specialty division. Gross profit margins decreased approximately 191 basis points in the protein
division due to challenges passing through beef prices as well as continued integration challenges at Del Monte. 

   Operating Expenses   

 Total operating expenses increased by
approximately 15.3%, or $8,787, to $66,106 for the thirteen weeks ended September 23, 2016 from $57,319 for the thirteen
weeks ended September 25, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 22.2% in the third quarter of 2016
compared to 20.7% in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in the Company s operating expense ratio is largely
attributable to the acquisition of MT Food, $2,481, as well as increased warehouse salary of $1,261 and occupancy costs of
$620 related to the Company s expanded warehouse capacity, higher delivery labor costs of $648, higher fleet
related expenses of $738 and additional amortization expense of $855. 

   Operating Income   

 Operating income for the thirteen weeks ended September
23, 2016 was $8,286 compared to $12,853 for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating
income was 2.8% for the thirteen weeks ended September 23, 2016 compared to 4.7% for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2015.
The decrease in operating income was driven primarily from the higher operating expenses discussed above partially offset by higher
gross profit. 

   Interest Expense   

 Total interest expense increased to $5,947 for the
thirteen weeks ended September 23, 2016 compared to $3,902 for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2015 due to higher levels
of debt as a result of the Company s previously disclosed refinancing completed on June 22, 2016. 

Provision for Income Taxes   

 For the thirteen weeks ended September 23, 2016, we
recorded an effective income tax rate of 41.6%. For the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2015, our effective income tax rate
was 41.6%. 

   Net Income   

 Reflecting the factors described above, net income
was $1,343 for the thirteen weeks ended September 23, 2016, compared to net income of $5,224 for the thirteen weeks ended September
25, 2015. 

  Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 23, 2016 Compared
to Thirty-nine Weeks Ended September 25, 2015  

   Net Sales   

 Our net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended September
23, 2016 increased approximately 12.8%, or $96,173, to $849,962 from $753,789 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015.
The increase in net sales was primarily the result of the Del Monte acquisition on April 6, 2015, the MT Food acquisition on June
27, 2016 and organic sales growth. Del Monte contributed approximately $48,219, or 6.4%, and MT Food contributed $15,619, or 2.1%,
to net sales growth for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016. Organic growth contributed the remaining approximately
$32,335, or 4.3%, of total net sales growth. 

   Gross Profit   

 Gross profit increased approximately 10.7%,
or $20,510, to $212,153 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016, from $191,643 for the thirty-nine weeks
ended September 25, 2015. Gross profit margin decreased approximately 46 basis points to 25.0% in the thirty-nine weeks
ended September 23, 2016 from 25.4% in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015. The decrease was primarily related to
the higher mix of protein sales in fiscal 2016 due to the acquisition of Del Monte in the second quarter of 2015. Gross
profit margins decreased approximately 14 basis points in the Company s specialty division and 84 basis
points in the protein division compared to strong margins in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015. 

   Operating Expenses   

 Total operating expenses increased by approximately
12.6%, or $21,002, to $187,318 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016 from $166,316 for the thirty-nine weeks ended
September 25, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 22.0% in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016
compared to 22.1% in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015. The increase in the Company s operating expenses is
largely attributable to the acquisitions of Del Monte and MT Food which accounted for year-on-year increases of $10,573 and $2,481,
respectively, and increased amortization expense of $1,950. 

   Operating Income   

 Operating income was $24,835 for the thirty-nine weeks
ended September 23, 2016 compared to $25,327 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015. As a percentage of net sales,
operating income was 3.0% for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016 compared to 3.4% for the thirty-nine weeks ended September
25, 2015. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily from the reduction in gross profit
margin as a percentage of sales discussed above. 

   Interest Expense   

 Total interest expense increased $25,929 to
$35,271 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016 from $9,312 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015.
The increase was primarily due to the refinancing of the Company s debt on June 22, 2016. As part of the refinancing,
the Company retired its previous revolving credit facility, term loan and senior secured notes. The Company was required to
pay the senior note holders make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early retirement of these notes. In addition, the
Company wrote off deferred financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured notes, term loan, and revolving
credit facility. This retirement was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and the loss on debt extinguishment of $22,310,
inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees is reflected in interest expense in the
thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016. In addition, the Company had higher overall debt levels in fiscal 2016 as a
result of financing the Del Monte acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. 

   Provision for Income Taxes   

 For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016,
we recorded an effective income tax rate of 41.6%. For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015, our effective income tax
rate was 41.6%. 

   Net (Loss) Income   

 Reflecting the factors described above, net income
decreased $15,673 to $(6,119) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016, compared to net income of $9,554 for the thirty-nine
weeks ended September 25, 2015. 

Product Category Sales Mix  

 The sales mix for the principal product categories
for thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015 is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 We finance our day-to-day operations and growth primarily
with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, operating leases, trade payables and bank
indebtedness. 

 On June 22, 2016, the Company refinanced its debt structure
by entering into a new senior secured term loan. The Company used the proceeds to pay down the revolving credit facility of $96,400,
the previous term loan of $1,681 and the senior secured notes of $125,000. The revolving credit facility and previous term loan
were originally due in April 2017. The senior secured notes had maturities of $50,000 in April 2018, $25,000 in October 2020 and
$50,000 in April 2023. The Company was required to pay the senior note holders make-whole payments totaling $21,144 for the early
retirement of these notes. In addition, the Company wrote off deferred financing fees totaling $1,091 relating to the senior secured
notes, term loan, and revolving credit facility. The refinancing met the requirements of a debt extinguishment for accounting purposes
and the loss on extinguishment of debt of $22,310, inclusive of the make-whole payments and write-off of deferred financing fees,
is reflected in interest expense. 

  Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility  

 On June 22, 2016, Chefs  Warehouse Parent, LLC
( CW Parent ) and Dairyland USA Corporation ( Dairyland ), as co-borrowers, and The Chefs  Warehouse,
Inc. (the  Company ) and certain other subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, entered into a credit agreement
(the  Term Loan Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders for which Jefferies Finance LLC ( Jefferies )
acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan B facility
(the  Term Loan Facility ) in an aggregate amount of $305,000 with a $50,000 six-month delayed draw term loan facility
(the  DDTL  the loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility (including the DDTL), the  Term Loans ).
On June 27, 2016, the Company drew $14,000 from the DDTL to help pay for the MT Food acquisition. On September 14, 2016, the Company
entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement under which the remaining portion of the DDTL was terminated, the Company s
interest rate schedule was modified and the Company repaid $25,000 of the outstanding balance of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.
The interest rate on this facility at September 23, 2016 was 6.75%. 

 Additionally, the co-borrowers under the Term Loan
Facility includes an accordion which permits the co-borrowers to request that the lenders extend additional Term Loans in an aggregate
principal amount of up to $50,000 (less the aggregate amount of certain indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions) plus an
unlimited amount subject to the Company s Total Leverage Ratio not exceeding 4.90:1.00 on a pro forma basis. 

 The final maturity of the Term Loan Facility is June
22, 2022. Subject to adjustment for prepayments, the Company is required to make quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loans
in an amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans. 

 All of the indebtedness outstanding under the Term Loan Facility
is guaranteed by the Company and the current and future domestic subsidiaries of CW Parent and Dairyland (other than Dairyland
HP, LLC). In addition, the Term Loan Facility is secured by a pledge of the equity interests of the Company s current and
future domestic subsidiaries (other than Dairyland HP, LLC) and by a first priority security interest (subject to certain permitted
liens) in substantially all of the personal property and other assets of the Company and its current and future domestic subsidiaries
(other than Dairyland HP, LLC), other than the assets and property securing the ABL Facility on a first priority basis described
above under  Asset-Based Loan Facility  (which assets secure the Term Loan Facility on a second priority basis). 

The interest rates per annum applicable to Term Loans,
will be, at the co-borrowers  option, equal to either a base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three, six or (if
consented to by the lenders) twelve-month, interest periods chosen by the Company, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. 

The Term Loan Facility contains customary affirmative covenants,
negative covenants (including restrictions, subject to customary exceptions, on incurring debt or liens, paying dividends, repaying
payment subordinated and junior lien debt, disposing assets, and making investments and acquisitions), and events of default for
a term loan B facility of this type, as more particularly described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. 

Asset Based Loan Facility  

 On June 22, 2016, CW Parent and Dairyland, as co-borrowers,
and the Company, The Chefs  Warehouse Mid-Atlantic, LLC, Bel Canto Foods, LLC, The Chefs  Warehouse West Coast, LLC,
The Chefs  Warehouse Of Florida, LLC, Michael s Finer Meats, LLC, Michael s Finer Meats Holdings, LLC, The Chefs 
Warehouse Midwest, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, entered into a   credit agreement
(the  ABL Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders for which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acts as administrative agent
and collateral agent. 

 The ABL Credit Agreement provides for an asset based
loan facility (the  ABL Facility ) in the aggregate amount of $75,000 of which up to $15,000 is available for letters
of credit and up to $10,000 is available for short-term borrowings on a swingline basis. Availability under the ABL Facility will
be limited to a borrowing base consisting of the difference of (a) the lesser of: (i) the aggregate amount of commitments
or (ii) the sum of specified percentages of eligible receivables and eligible inventory, minus certain availability reserves
minus (b) outstanding borrowings. The co-borrowers under the ABL Facility are entitled on one or more occasions, subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase in the commitments under the ABL Facility in an aggregate principal
amount of up to $25,000. The ABL Facility matures on June 22, 2021. 

 All of the indebtedness outstanding under the ABL Facility
is guaranteed by the Company and the current and future domestic subsidiaries of CW Parent and Dairyland (other than Dairyland
HP, LLC). In addition, the ABL Facility is secured by a first priority security interest (subject to certain permitted liens) in
certain property and assets, including accounts, inventory, deposit accounts, securities accounts and other personal property relating
to the accounts and inventory, of the Company and its current and future domestic subsidiaries (other than Dairyland HP, LLC),
and by a second priority security interest (ranking behind the security interest securing the Term Loan Facility and subject to
certain permitted liens) in substantially all of the other personal property and assets of the Company and such subsidiaries. 

 The interest rates per annum applicable to loans, other
than swingline loans, under the ABL Credit Facility will be, at the co-borrowers  option, equal to either a base rate or
an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) 12-month, interest periods chosen by the Company,
in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. The co-borrowers will pay certain recurring fees with respect to the ABL Facility,
including fees on the unused commitments of the lenders. 

 The ABL Facility contains customary affirmative covenants,
negative covenants and events of default as more particularly described in the ABL Credit Agreement. The ABL Facility will require
compliance with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio if the amount of availability under the ABL Facility falls below
a specified dollar amount or percentage of the borrowing base. 

   New Markets Tax Credit Loan   

 On April 26, 2012, Dairyland HP LLC ( DHP ),
an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, entered into a financing arrangement under the New Markets Tax Credit ( NMTC )
program under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pursuant to which a subsidiary of Chase, provided to DHP an $11,000
construction loan (the  NMTC Loan ) to help fund DHP s expansion and build-out of our Bronx, New York facility
and the rail shed located at that facility, which construction is required under the facility lease agreement. Borrowings under
the NMTC Loan are secured by a first priority secured lien on DHPs leasehold interest in our Bronx, New York facility, including
all improvements made on the premises, as well as, among other things, a lien on all fixtures incorporated into the project improvements. 

 Under the NMTC Loan, DHP is obligated to pay (i)
monthly interest payments on the principal balance then outstanding and (ii) the entire unpaid principal balance then due and owing
on April 26, 2017. So long as DHP is not in default, interest accrues on borrowings at 1.00% per annum. We may prepay the NMTC
Loan, in whole or in part, in $100 increments. 

 As of September 23, 2016, DHP was in compliance with
all debt covenants under the NMTC Loan. 

   Convertible Subordinated Notes   

 On April 6, 2015, the Company issued $36,750 principal
amount of convertible subordinated notes with a six-year maturity bearing interest at 2.5% and a conversion price of $29.70 per
share (the  Convertible Subordinated Notes ) to certain of the Del Monte entities as partial consideration in the Del
Monte acquisition. The holders of the Convertible Subordinated Notes may, in certain instances beginning one year after issuance,
redeem the Convertible Subordinated Notes for cash or shares of the Company s common stock. Moreover, the Company may pay
the outstanding principal amount due and owing under the Convertible Subordinated Notes at maturity in either cash or shares of
the Company s common stock. Interest is payable annually in cash with the first interest payment due on April 6, 2016. The
Convertible Subordinated Notes, which are subordinate to the Company s and its subsidiaries  senior debt, are convertible
into shares of the Company s common stock by the holders at any time at a conversion price of $29.70. 

Liquidity  

 We believe our capital expenditures, excluding cash
paid for acquisitions, for fiscal 2016 will be approximately $14,000. The significant decrease from $21,656 in fiscal 2015 in projected
capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 is the result of the completion of the renovation and expansion
of our new Bronx, NY and Las Vegas, NV distribution facilities. Recurring capital expenditures will be financed with
cash generated from operations and borrowings under our ABL Facility. Our planned capital projects will provide both new and expanded
facilities and improvements to our technology that we believe will produce increased efficiency and the capacity to continue to
support the growth of our customer base. Future investments and acquisitions will be financed through either internally generated
cash flow, borrowings under our credit facilities in place at the time of the potential investment or acquisition or through the
issuance of equity or debt securities, including, but not limited to, longer-term, fixed-rate debt securities and shares of our
common stock. 

 On June 27, 2016, the Company acquired
substantially all the assets of MT Food, a specialty food distributor based out of Chicago, IL. The purchase price for the
transaction was $21,500, of which, $21,000 was paid in cash at closing and an additional $500 payable eighteen months after
the closing date. The selling price may be increased by an additional $500 provided certain performance metrics are met in
the post-acquisition period. The acquisition was paid for with cash on hand and drawdown of our delayed draw term loan
facility. 

 In July 2015, we closed on a sale-leaseback transaction
of our new Las Vegas, NV distribution facility. The property was sold for $14,645, which approximated its cost. The related on-going
lease will be accounted for as an operating lease. 

 Net cash provided by operations was $21,208 for
thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016, an increase of $4,463 from the $16,745 provided by operations for thirty-nine
weeks ended September 25, 2015. The primary reasons for the increase in net cash provided by operations was increased cash
generated through net income from operations partially offset by cash used in working capital changes. During the first
thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2016 net income decreased by $15,673. The primary cause for this decrease in net income was a
loss on extinguishment of debt of $22,310, partially offset by the related tax impact on the loss of approximately $9,281.
Exclusive of the net impact of the loss on extinguishment, which is a cash flow from financing activities, net income from
operations decreased by $2,644. Embedded within the net income from operations decrease, non-cash charges increased by
$4,963, representing an overall increase of cash provided by operations through net income of $2,319. The primary cause for
this increase was the Company s organic growth as well as the cash generating impacts of the Del Monte and MT Food
acquisitions. The decrease in cash provided by changes in working capital was primarily due to an increase in cash used for
accounts payable changes of $9,548 and an increase in cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets changes of
$6,894 (exclusive of the tax impact of the loss on debt extinguishment, a financing activity), offset by increases in cash
provided by inventory changes of $11,820 and accounts receivable changes of $7,921. 

 Net cash used in investing activities was $31,274 for
thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016, a decrease of $95,617 from the net cash used in investing activities of $126,891 for
the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015. The decrease in net cash used was primarily due to lower cash paid for acquisitions,
resulting from the Del Monte acquisition in 2015 partially offset by the cash paid for the MT Food acquisition in 2016, and lower
capital expenditures the result of completing construction of our Bronx, NY and Las Vegas, NV distribution facilities offset, in
part, by the sale of one of our owned facilities in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015. 

 Net cash provided by financing activities was $33,651
for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016, a decrease of $74,890 from the $108,541 provided by financing activities for
the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the debt issued in 2015 to pay for the Del Monte
acquisition and payments made to pay down our revolving credit facility in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016, the
result of improved cash flow from operations and lower capital expenditures. 

   Seasonality   

 Excluding our direct-to-consumer business, we generally
do not experience any material seasonality. However, our sales and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter due to factors
such as changes in our operating expenses, management s ability to execute our operating and growth strategies, personnel
changes, demand for our products, supply shortages, weather patterns and general economic conditions. 

 Our direct-to-consumer business is subject to seasonal
fluctuations, with direct-to-consumer center-of-the-plate protein sales typically higher during the holiday season in our fourth
quarter; accordingly, a disproportionate amount of operating cash flows from this portion of our business is generated by our direct-to-consumer
business in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Despite a significant portion of these sales occurring in the fourth quarter,
there are operating expenses, principally advertising and promotional expenses, throughout the year. 

Inflation   

 Our profitability is dependent on, among other things,
our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and other raw materials,
labor, energy and other supplies and services. Substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to
the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our customers. The impact of inflation and deflation on food, labor, energy
and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our operations. 

   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

 As of September 23, 2016, we did not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

 The preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements requires it to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as
those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results and require its most
difficult, complex or subjective judgments or estimates. Based on this definition, we believe our critical accounting policies
include the following: (i) determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, (ii) inventory valuation, with regard to
determining the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, (iii) valuing goodwill and intangible assets, (iv) vendor
rebates and other promotional incentives, (v) self-insurance reserves, (vi) accounting for income taxes and (vii) contingent
earn-out liabilities. For all financial statement periods presented, there have been no material modifications to the application
of these critical accounting policies. 

   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

 We analyze customer creditworthiness, accounts receivable
balances, payment history, payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful
accounts. In instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer, future sales to the customer are either conducted
using cash-on-delivery terms or the account is closely monitored so that agreed-upon payments are received prior to orders being
released. A failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders. Our accounts receivable balance was $121,493 and $124,139, net
of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $6,091 and $5,803, as of September 23, 2016 and December 25, 2015, respectively. 

   Inventory Valuation   

 We maintain reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventories.
These reserves are primarily based upon inventory age plus specifically identified inventory items and overall economic conditions.
A sudden and unexpected change in consumer preferences or change in overall economic conditions could result in a significant change
in the reserve balance and could require a corresponding charge to earnings. We actively manage our inventory levels as we seek
to minimize the risk of loss and have consistently achieved a relatively high level of inventory turnover. 

   Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets   

 We are required to test goodwill for impairment at
least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair
value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment
during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, as we aggregate our
component units into two reporting units, Protein and Specialty, based on a discounted cash flow approach. The goodwill impairment
analysis is a two-step test. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing our estimated fair value
to our carrying value, including goodwill. If our estimated fair value exceeds our carrying value, goodwill is considered not to
be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second
step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. If required, the second step involves calculating an implied fair value
of our goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a
business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate
estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if we were being acquired in a business
combination. If the implied fair value of our goodwill exceeds the carrying value of our goodwill, there is no impairment. If the
carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of our goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. 

 When analyzing whether to aggregate the business components
into single reporting units, the Company considers whether each component has similar economic characteristics. The Company has
evaluated the economic characteristics of its different geographic markets, including its recently acquired businesses, along with
the similarity of the operations and margins, nature of the products, type of customer and methods of distribution of products
and the regulatory environment in which the Company operates and concluded that the business components can be combined into two
reporting units, Protein and Specialty. 

 In fiscal 2015, our annual assessment indicated that
we are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test and no impairment of goodwill existed, as the fair value
of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying value. We have noted no indicators of impairment during the thirty-nine weeks ended
September 23, 2016. Total goodwill as of September 23, 2016 and December 25, 2015 was $167,016 and $155,816, respectively. 

Intangible assets with finite lives are tested for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected
to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation
indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured based on a projected
discounted cash flow model. There have been no events or changes in circumstances during 2016 or 2015 indicating that the carrying
value of our finite-lived intangible assets are not recoverable. Total finite-lived intangible assets as of September 23, 2016
and December 25, 2015 were $130,694 and $132,211, respectively. 

 The assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and
intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved. 

   Vendor Rebates and Other Promotional Incentives   

 We participate in various rebate and promotional incentives
with our suppliers, including volume and growth rebates, annual incentives and promotional programs. In accounting for vendor rebates,
we follow the guidance in ASC 605-50 (Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 02-16,  Accounting by a Customer (Including a
Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor  and EITF No. 03-10,  Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers
to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers) . 

 We generally record consideration received under these
incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold; however, in certain circumstances, we record marketing-related consideration as
a reduction of marketing costs incurred. We may receive consideration in the form of cash and/or invoice deductions. 

 We record consideration that we receive for volume
and growth rebates and annual incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold. We systematically and rationally allocate the consideration
for those incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by us toward earning the incentives. If the
incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable, we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved.
We record annual incentives when we earn them, generally over the agreement period. We record consideration received to promote
and sell the suppliers  products as a reduction of our costs, as the consideration is typically a reimbursement of costs
incurred by us. If we received consideration from the suppliers in excess of our costs, we record any excess as a reduction of
cost of goods sold. 

   Self-Insurance Reserves   

 Effective October 1, 2011, we began maintaining a self-insured
group medical program. The program contains individual stop loss thresholds of $125 per incident and aggregate stop loss thresholds
based upon the average number of employees enrolled in the program throughout the year. The amount in excess of the self-insured
levels is fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with this program are estimated in part by considering
historical claims experience and medical cost trends. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the
random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from
these assumptions and historical trends. 

 Effective August 1, 2012, we became self-insured for
workers  compensation and automobile liability to deductibles or self-insured retentions of $350 for workers compensation
and $250 for automobile liability per occurrence. The amounts in excess of our deductibles are fully insured by third party insurers.
Liabilities associated with this program are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and cost trends. Projections
of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly
affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 

   Income Taxes   

 The determination of our provision for income taxes
requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for
income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. Jurisdictional
tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals
for unrecognized tax benefits, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective
tax rate. 

   Contingent Earn-out Liabilities   

 We account for contingent consideration relating to
business combinations as a liability and an increase to goodwill at the date of the acquisition and continually re-measure the
liability at each balance sheet date by recording changes in the fair value through our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We determine the fair value of contingent consideration based on future operating projections under various potential scenarios,
including the use of Monte Carlo simulations, and weight the probability of these outcomes. The ultimate settlement of contingent
earn-out liabilities relating to business combinations may be for amounts which are materially different from the amounts initially
recorded and may cause volatility in our results of operations. 

Management has discussed the development and selection
of these critical accounting policies with our Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the above disclosure. Our
condensed consolidated financial statements contain other items that require estimation, but are not as critical as those discussed
above. These other items include our calculations for bonus accruals, depreciation and amortization. Changes in estimates and assumptions
used in these and other items could have an effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 3.   
         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
 
   Interest Rate Risk   

 As of September 23, 2016, we had $293,202 million of
indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan and $2,774 million outstanding under a software financing agreement
that bore interest at variable rates. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease our after tax earnings
by approximately $1,729 per annum, holding other variables constant. 

ITEM 4.   
         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
 
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

 Our management, with the participation of our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered
by this Form 10-Q. The evaluation included certain internal control areas in which we have made and are continuing to make changes
to improve and enhance controls. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures
relative to their costs. 

 Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the end of the period covered
by this Form 10-Q to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

 There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during the most recent fiscal period that may have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As of September 23, 2016, the Company has transitioned five of the six divisions
of Del Monte from the legacy Del Monte ERP system to the Company s protein group ERP system. The Company plans to complete
the Del Monte system transition during fiscal 2016. Additionally, the Company plans to transition MT Food s ERP system to
the specialty group ERP in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, when the operations are combined with the Company s existing
Chicago distribution center. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.   
         LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    
 
 We are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation
arising out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Although we cannot assure the outcome, management presently believes that
the result of such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial statements, and no material amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements with respect to these
matters. 

ITEM 1A.    
        RISK FACTORS    

There has been no material changes with respect to
the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016 or our Form 10-Q filed with the
SEC on August 3, 2016. 

ITEM 2.   
         UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS    

(1)  
       
      During the thirteen weeks ended September 23, 2016, we withheld 10,928 shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of restricted shares of our common stock awarded to our officers and key employees.   

ITEM 3.
