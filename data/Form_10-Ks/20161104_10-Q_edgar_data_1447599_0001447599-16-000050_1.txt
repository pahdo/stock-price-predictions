  The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company. The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information, and in management s opinion, includes all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the Company s financial position, its results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three and   nine months ended October 1, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any other period. 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2016. There have been no significant changes in the Company s accounting policies from those disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  The Company s fiscal year ends on December 31 of each year. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted a 4-4-5 week quarterly calendar, which, for the 2016 fiscal year, is comprised of four fiscal quarters ending on April 2, 2016, July 2, 2016, October 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016. The Company did not adjust operating results for quarters prior to 2016. There were 91 and 92 days in the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and 275 and 273 days in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The primary estimates and assumptions made by management related to revenue recognition, reserves for sales returns and incentives, reserves for warranty, valuation of stock options, fair value of derivative assets and liabilities, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, accruals for the Fitbit Force recall, fair value of goodwill and acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed during acquisitions, the number of reporting segments, the recoverability of intangible assets and their useful lives, contingencies, and the valuations of deferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Non-Monetary Transaction 
    
  The Company entered into an agreement with a third party during the three months ended October 1, 2016 to exchange inventory for advertising credits and cash. The Company recorded the transaction based on the estimated fair value of the products exchanged. The Company recorded   $15.0 million   of revenue during the three months ended October 1, 2016 related to the transaction. The   $13.0 million   of unused advertising credits remaining as of October 1, 2016 were recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Such credits are expected to be used over   three years  , and will be expensed as advertising services are received. 
    
  Out-of-Period Adjustment 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company identified an error, which resulted in an understatement of income tax expense by   $3.0 million   for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct the error in the quarter ended April 2, 2016. The Company assessed the materiality of this error and concluded the error was not material to 2015 consolidated financial statements and is not expected to be material to 2016 consolidated financial statements, and therefore, the Company recorded the correction in the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC 606),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods and services or enters  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents     
  FITBIT, INC. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the currently effective guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet selected a transition method. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . This ASU requires lease assets and lease liabilities arising from leases, including operating leases, to be recognized on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, and requires adoption using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718).   This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   This ASU provides for a new impairment model which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments. ASU 2016-13 will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  . This ASU provides guidance intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

2.    Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The carrying values of the Company s accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximated their fair values due to the short period of time to maturity or repayment.  
    
  The following tables set forth the Company s financial instruments that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands): 

9 

     Table of Contents     
  FITBIT, INC. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The fair value of the Company s Level 1 financial instruments is based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments. The fair value of the Company s Level 2 financial instruments is based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
    
  In addition, Level 2 assets and liabilities include derivative financial instruments associated with hedging activity, which are further discussed in Note 3. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date using inputs such as spot rates, forward rates, and discount rates. There is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. 
    
  There were   no   Level 3 assets or liabilities as of   October 1, 2016   and December 31, 2015. There have been no transfers between fair value measurement levels during the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 

3.    Financial Instruments 
    
  Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities 
    
  The Company s marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale as of the balance sheet date and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders  equity. Because the Company views marketable securities as available to support current operations as needed, it has classified all available-for-sale securities as current assets. Realized gains or losses and other-than-temporary impairments, if any, on available-for-sale securities are reported in other income (expense), net as incurred.  
    
   Investments are reviewed periodically to identify potential other-than-temporary impairments.   No   impairment loss has been recorded on the securities included in the tables below because the Company believes that the decrease in fair value of these securities is temporary and expects to recover up to, or beyond, the initial cost of investment for these securities.  
    
  The following table sets forth cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of   October 1, 2016   (in thousands):  

10 

     Table of Contents     
  FITBIT, INC. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The following table sets forth cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

The gross unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were not material. There were   no   available-for-sale investments as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. 
    
  The following table classifies marketable securities by contractual maturities (in thousands): 

Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company operates in foreign countries, which exposes it to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies. In order to manage this risk, the Company may hedge a portion of its foreign currency exposures related to outstanding monetary assets and liabilities as well as forecasted revenues and expenses, using foreign currency exchange forward or option contracts. In general, the market risk related to these contracts is offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged transactions. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges 
    
  Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, the Company has entered into foreign currency derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue and expense transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company s cash flow hedges consist of forward contracts with maturities of 12 months or less. 
    
  The Company periodically assesses the effectiveness of its cash flow hedges. Effectiveness represents a derivative instrument s ability to generate offsetting changes in cash flows related to the hedged risk. All elements of the hedged transaction are included in the effectiveness assessment. The Company records the gains or losses, net of tax, related to the effective portion of its cash flow hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders  equity and subsequently reclassifies the gains or losses into revenue and operating expenses when the underlying hedged transactions are recognized. The Company records the gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedges, if any, immediately in other income (expense), net. If the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would immediately be reclassified to other income (expense), net. Cash flows related to the Company s cash flow hedging program are recognized as cash flows from operating activities in its statements of cash flows. 
    
  The Company had outstanding contracts with a total notional amount of   $283.2 million   and   $63.3 million   in cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue and expense transactions, respectively, as of   October 1, 2016  , and   $254.1 million   in cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue transactions as of   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Balance Sheet Hedges 
    
  The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of its subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value, do  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents     
  FITBIT, INC. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in the value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net and offset the foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying net monetary assets or liabilities.  
    
  The Company had outstanding balance sheet hedges with a total notional amount of   $141.0 million   and   $104.8 million   as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Fair Value of Foreign Currency Derivatives 
    
  The foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled at the end of the period are recorded at fair value, on a gross basis, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents the fair value of the Company s foreign currency derivative contracts as of the periods presented (in thousands): 

Financial Statement Effect of Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts 
    
  The following table presents the pre-tax impact of the Company s foreign currency derivative contracts on other comprehensive income, or OCI, and the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (in thousands): 

As of   October 1, 2016  , all net derivative gains related to the Company s cash flow hedges will be reclassified from OCI into net income within the next 12 months. 
    
  Offsetting of Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts 
    
  The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at gross fair values in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which mitigate credit risk by permitting net settlement  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents

  During the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016, changes related to pre-existing warranties resulted primarily from a reduction in the estimated cost of replacement units.

  Fitbit Force Recall Reserve 
    
  In March 2014, the Company announced a recall for one of its products, the Fitbit Force, or Fitbit Force Recall. The product recall, which is regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, covered all Fitbit Force units sold since the product was first introduced in October 2013. The product recall program has no expiration date. 
    
  As a result of the product recall, the Company established reserves that include cost estimates for customer refunds, logistics and handling fees for managing product returns and processing refunds, obsolescence of on-hand inventory, cancellation charges for existing purchase commitments and rework of component inventory with the contract manufacturer, write-offs of tooling and manufacturing equipment, and legal settlement costs.

  2014 Credit Agreement 
    
  In August 2014, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, or Asset-Based Credit Facility, with a borrowing limit of   $180.0 million  .   The Asset-Based Credit Facility allowed the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (i)   $180.0 million  , including up to   $50.0 million   for the issuance of letters of credit and up to   $25.0 million   for swing line loans and (ii) the borrowing base then in effect less the amount then outstanding under letters of credit and loans. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the effective interest rate on the revolving line of credit was   4.25%  . The Asset-Based Credit Facility was terminated in December 2015. 
    
  2014 Revolving Credit and Guarantee Agreement 
    
  In August 2014, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guarantee agreement, or Cash Flow Facility. In October 2014, the Company amended the Cash Flow Facility to increase the borrowing limit under the Cash Flow Facility. The Cash Flow Facility allowed the Company to borrow up to   $50.0 million  , including up to   $10.0 million   for the issuance of letters of credit and  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents     
  FITBIT, INC. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

up to   $10.0 million   for swing line loans. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the effective interest rate on the revolving line of credit was   3.59%  . The Cash Flow Facility was terminated in December 2015. 
    
  2015 Credit Agreement 
    
  In December 2015, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement, or Senior Facility, to replace the existing Asset-Based Credit Facility and Cash Flow Facility. This Senior Facility allows the Company to borrow up to   $250.0 million  , including up to   $50.0 million   for the issuance of letters of credit and up to   $25.0 million   for swing line loans. Borrowings under the Senior Facility may be drawn as Alternate Base Rate, or ABR, loans or Eurodollar loans, and mature in December 2020. ABR loans bear interest at a variable rate equal to the applicable margin plus the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.5%  , and (iii) the Eurodollar rate plus   1.0%  , but in any case at a minimum rate of   3.25%   per annum. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a variable rate based on the LIBOR rate and Eurodollar reserve requirements, but in any case at a minimum rate of   1.0%   per annum.  
    
  The Company has the option to repay its borrowings under the Senior Facility without penalty prior to maturity. The Senior Facility requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, including maintaining a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least   1.15  :1, and a consolidated leverage ratio of less than   3  :1. The Senior Facility also requires the Company to comply with certain non-financial covenants. The Senior Facility contains customary covenants that restrict the Company s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, guarantee certain obligations of third parties, declare dividends or make certain distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of   October 1, 2016  . Obligations under the Senior Facility are collateralized by substantially all of the Company s assets, excluding the Company s intellectual property. As of   October 1, 2016  , there were   no   outstanding borrowings under the Senior Facility.  
    
  Letters of Credit 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling   $37.9 million   and   $17.1 million  , respectively, issued to cover various security deposits on the Company s facility leases. 

6.    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Leases 
    
  The Company leases office space in various locations with expiration dates between 2016 and 2024. The lease agreements often include leasehold improvement incentives, escalating lease payments, renewal provisions and other provisions which require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, maintenance costs or defined rent increases. Rent expense is recorded over the lease terms on a straight-line basis. In April 2016, the Company entered into a sublease to expand the Company s existing headquarters. The lease expires in 2024. Future minimum payments under the leases as of   October 1, 2016   were   $305.2 million  . 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  Fitbit Force.   In 2014, class action and personal injury lawsuits were filed against the Company based upon claims of allergic reactions from adhesives in the Fitbit Force, and alleged violations of various state false advertising and unfair competition statutes based on the Company s sale and marketing of the Fitbit Force. The class action cases were settled in 2014. Certain personal injury complaints were filed in 2015, and the settlement of those claims is almost final. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company received proceeds from the insurance policies that apply to these claims and related legal fees, and the Company recorded an accrual for liabilities arising under these claims that was immaterial and falls within the amount of the insurance proceeds received. 
    
  Fitbit Zip, Fitbit One, Fitbit Flex, Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fitbit Surge.   In 2014,   one   personal injury lawsuit was filed against the Company based upon claims of skin irritation from the Fitbit Flex. Additional lawsuits were filed in 2015 based upon claims of personal injury from the Fitbit Zip, Fitbit One, Fitbit Flex, Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fitbit Surge. Settlement of those claims is almost final. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company received proceeds from the insurance policies that apply to these claims and related legal fees, and the Company recorded an accrual for liabilities arising under these claims that was immaterial and falls within the amount of the insurance proceeds received. 
    
  Jawbone.   On May 27, 2015, Aliphcom, Inc. d/b/a Jawbone, or Jawbone, filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California in the County of San Francisco against the Company and certain of its employees who were formerly employed by Jawbone, alleging trade secret misappropriation and unfair and unlawful business practices against all defendants, and alleging breach of  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents     
  FITBIT, INC. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against the employee defendants. The complaint alleges, among other things, that prior to leaving Jawbone at various times in 2015, the employees downloaded Jawbone company documents and materials, including allegedly confidential and trade secret information, and that these employees are using such information in the development of the Company s products. The complaint also alleges that the Company recruited those employees with the intent of using Jawbone s proprietary information. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including punitive damages and injunctive relief. On May 31, 2016, the Court granted a demurrer on the unfair business practices cause of action as to both the Company and the individual defendants. On June 23, 2016, Jawbone filed a Second Amended Complaint, adding an additional employee defendant and making additional allegations. 
    
  On June 10, 2015, Jawbone and BodyMedia, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jawbone, or BodyMedia, filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company infringes   three   U.S. patents held by them: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,446,275, 8,073,707, and 8,398,546. Jawbone and BodyMedia allege that these patents have been infringed by a substantial majority of the Company s products.  
    
  On July 3, 2015, Jawbone and BodyMedia amended their complaint to add   three   additional U.S. patents to the infringement claims against the Company: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,529,811, 8,793,522, and 8,961,413. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages and attorneys  fees from the Company and to permanently enjoin the Company from making, manufacturing, using, selling, importing, or offering the Company s products for sale. The lawsuit has been stayed pending the investigation in the ITC. 
    
  On July 7, 2015, Jawbone and BodyMedia filed a complaint with the ITC requesting an investigation into purported violations of the Tariff Act of 1930 by the Company and Flextronics International Ltd. and Flextronics Sales and Marketing (A-P) Ltd. The complaint alleges that the Company s products infringe the same   six   U.S. patents at issue in action brought against the Company in federal court. The complaint makes the same allegations of trade secret misappropriation, unfair competition and unfair acts as a result of the Company s hiring of the former Jawbone employees, as in the action brought against it and certain of the Company s employees in the state case. The complaint seeks a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order halting the importation and sale of the Company s products that allegedly infringe upon Jawbone s patents and misappropriate Jawbone s trade secrets. The ITC instituted the investigation on August 17, 2015. 
    
  On February 8, 2016, Jawbone filed a motion for partial termination of the investigation as to the  522 patent after discovery showed the Company s products do not actually practice the patent. On March 4, 2016, Jawbone filed a motion for partial termination of the investigation as to the  811 patent after a claim construction ruling that was favorable to the Company suggested non-infringement by the Company s products. On March 4, 2016, the administrative law judge, or ALJ, issued an Initial Determination, or ID, that granted a Motion for Summary Determination as to the  546 and  275 patents on grounds they are ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C.   101. The ID was affirmed by the ITC on April 4, 2016. On June 3, 2016, Jawbone filed a notice of appeal in the Federal Circuit. On April 28, 2016, the ALJ issued an ID that granted a Motion for Summary Determination as to the  707 and  413 patents on grounds they are ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C.   101. The ID was affirmed by the ITC on June 2, 2016.  
    
  A trial on the trade secrets allegations took place from May 9 to May 17, 2016. On August 23, 2016, the ALJ issued an ID that concluded that the Company did not misappropriate any Jawbone trade secrets. On October 20, 2016, the ITC declined to review the ID, making it a Final Determination, and terminated the investigation in the ITC. 
    
  On September 3, 2015, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement against Jawbone in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting that its activity trackers (UP Move, UP24, UP3, and UP4) infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 8,909,543, 9,031,812, and 9,042,971. On September 8, 2015, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement against Jawbone in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, asserting that its activity trackers infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,026,053, 9,084,923, and 9,106,307. On October 29, 2015, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement against Jawbone in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting that its activity trackers infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 8,920,332, 8,868,377, and 9,089,760. 
    
  On November 2, 2015, the Company filed a complaint with the ITC requesting an investigation into violations of the Tariff Act of 1930 by Jawbone and Body Media. The complaint asserts that Jawbone s products infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 8,920,332, 8,868,377, and 9,089,760. The complaint seeks a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order halting the importation and sale of Jawbone s products that the Company believes infringe upon its patents. The ITC instituted the investigation on December 1, 2015. On July 20, 2016, the ALJ issued an Initial Determination that granted a Motion for Summary Determination as to the  332,  377, and  760 patents on grounds they are ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C.   101. As a result, the investigation was terminated and the August 4, 2016 trial date cancelled. On September 7, 2016, the ITC reviewed the Initial Determination  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents     
  FITBIT, INC. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

and vacated the Initial Determination s grant of summary determination as to the  332 and  377 patents. No new trial date has been scheduled. 
    
  The first case filed by the Company against Jawbone in the District of Delaware, as to the  543,  812, and  971 patents, has been transferred to the Northern District of California. The second case filed by the Company against Jawbone in the District of Delaware, as to the  332,  377, and  760 patents, has been stayed, pending a determination in the ITC on the same patents. In the case filed by the Company in the Northern District of California, on October 30, 2015, Jawbone answered and made an antitrust counterclaim, asserting that the Company s infringement claims are somehow  sham litigation  and that by asserting these claims and hiring some of Jawbone s employees, the Company is allegedly monopolizing a market of personal fitness trackers. In response to the Company s motion to dismiss the antitrust counterclaim, on January 13, 2016, Jawbone amended its Answer and antitrust counterclaim. The Company moved to stay and bifurcate the antitrust claim, and on May 27, 2016, the Court granted the motion. On June 15, 2016, Jawbone filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which the Company opposed. On July 12, 2016, Jawbone withdrew its motion.  
    
  The Company intends to vigorously defend and prosecute each of the Jawbone litigation matters and, based on its review, the Company believes it has valid defenses and claims with respect to each of these matters. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against the Company or any adverse settlement could materially and adversely impact its business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. Regarding the six matters still in the early stages of litigation, the Company is unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters. In addition, these litigation matters are complex, likely to involve significant management time and attention, and the cost of defending and prosecuting these matters is likely to be expensive, regardless of outcome. 
    
  Sleep Tracking.   On May 8, 2015, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the sleep tracking function available in certain trackers does not perform as advertised. Plaintiffs seek class certification, restitution, an award of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys  fees, and other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. Plaintiffs have amended their complaint four times, and on January 15, 2016, the Company moved to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint.  On July 15, 2016, the Court denied the motion to dismiss. Trial is currently scheduled for May 30, 2017. 
    
  The Company believes that the plaintiffs  allegations are without merit, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Because the Company is in the early stages of this litigation matter, the Company is unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter. 
    
  Heart Rate Tracking  .   On January 6, 2016 and February 16, 2016,   two   purported class action lawsuits were filed against the Company in the U.S. District for the Northern District of California, alleging that the PurePulse heart rate tracking technology in the Fitbit Charge HR and Fitbit Surge do not consistently and accurately record users  heart rates. Plaintiffs allege common law claims as well as violations of various states  false advertising and unfair competition statutes based on the Company s sale and marketing of the Fitbit Charge HR and Fitbit Surge. Plaintiffs seek class certification, injunctive and declaratory relief, restitution, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages, and statutory penalties and damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys  fees, and other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On April 15, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Master Class Action Complaint that combines the plaintiffs from the   two   previously filed complaints. On May 19, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Master Class Action Complaint. Attached as an exhibit was a  study  commissioned by the plaintiffs and performed by   two   researchers at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, which allegedly found that the Fitbit devices incorrectly measured heart rate by an average of   20   beats per minute during moderate to high exercise. The Company has not yet answered. On November 10, 2016, the parties have a hearing on whether the issue of arbitrability should be decided by the arbitrator. 
    
  The Company believes that the plaintiffs  allegations are without merit, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims.

  Federal Securities Class Action  .   On January 11, 2016, a putative securities class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California     naming as defendants the Company and certain of its officers (the  Federal Securities Class Action ). On May 10, 2016, the Court appointed the Fitbit Investor Group (consisting of   five   individual investors) as lead plaintiff. The amended complaint, filed on July 1, 2016, names as defendants the Company, certain of its officers and directors, and certain financial institutions that acted as underwriters in connection with the Company s June 2015 initial public offering, or IPO. Plaintiffs allege violations of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

amended, or the Exchange Act, based on alleged materially false and misleading statements about the Company s products between October 27, 2014 and November 23, 2015. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s securities (i) on the open market between June 18, 2015 and May 19, 2016; and/or (ii) pursuant to or traceable to the IPO. Plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys  fees, and other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint on July 29, 2016. On October 26, 2016, the Court denied the motion to dismiss. 
    
  The Company believes that the plaintiffs  allegations are without merit, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Because the Company is in the early stages of this litigation matter, the Company is unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter. 
    
  State Securities Class Action  .   On April 28, 2016, a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of the Securities Act was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo, naming as defendants the Company, certain of its officers, its board members, the underwriters for the IPO, and a number of its investors (the  San Mateo Action ). On May 23, 2016, the Court granted plaintiff s request to voluntarily dismiss the investor defendants. Plaintiff alleges that the IPO registration statement contained material misstatements about the Company s products. Plaintiff seeks to represent a class of persons who purchased Fitbit common stock in and/or traceable to the IPO. Plaintiff seeks class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys  fees, and other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.  
    
  On May 17, 2016, a shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco alleging claims similar to those at issue in the San Mateo Action and the Federal Securities Class Action (the  San Francisco Action ). The complaint alleges violations of the Securities Act based on alleged material misstatements in the registration statements for the IPO and November 2015 follow-on public offering and names as defendants the Company, certain of its officers and directors, the underwriters for the Company s public offerings, and two of the Company s investors. Plaintiff seeks to represent a class of persons who acquired Fitbit common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the IPO and follow-on public offering.   
    
  The Company removed both the San Mateo Action and the San Francisco Action to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On July 27, 2016, the District Court remanded the actions back to state court.  Defendants have not yet answered. On September 19, 2016, the San Mateo Action was transferred to the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. 
    
  The Company believes that the plaintiffs  allegations in these actions are without merit, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Because the Company is in the early stages of this litigation matter, the Company is unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter. 
    
  Other.   The Company is and, from time to time, may in the future become, involved in other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The Company currently believes that the outcome of any of these existing legal proceedings, including the aforementioned cases, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material impact on the operating results, financial condition or cash flows of the Company. With respect to existing legal proceedings, the Company has either determined that the existence of a material loss is not reasonably possible or that it is unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company may incur substantial legal fees, which are expensed as incurred, in defending against these legal proceedings.

  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may include indemnification provisions. Pursuant to such agreements, the Company may indemnify, hold harmless and defend an indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. Some of the provisions will limit losses to those arising from third-party actions. In some cases, the indemnification will continue after the termination of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these provisions is not determinable. To date, the Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware corporate law. The Company also currently has directors  and officers  insurance.

7.    Stock Plan 
    
  Equity Incentive Plans 
    
  In May 2015, the Company s board of directors and stockholders adopted and approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan became effective on June 16, 2015 and serves as the successor to the Amended and Restated 2007 Stock Plan, or 2007 Plan. The Company ceased granting awards under the 2007 Plan, and any outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, granted under the 2007 Plan will remain subject to the terms of the 2007 Plan. As of   October 1, 2016  ,   7.6   million shares of Class A common stock were reserved and available for future issuance under the 2015 Plan.  
    
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  In May 2015, the Company s board of directors adopted the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, which became effective on June 17, 2015. A total of   3.8   million shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2015 ESPP. The 2015 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company s Class A common stock through payroll deductions at a price per share equal to   85%   of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company s Class A common stock (i) on the first trading day of the applicable offering period and (2) the last trading day of each purchase period in the applicable offering period. Except for the initial offering period, the 2015 ESPP provides for   6  -month offering periods beginning in May and November of each year. The initial offering period began June 17, 2015 and ended in May 2016. 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  Stock option activity under the equity incentive plans was as follows: 

The aggregate intrinsic values of stock options outstanding, exercisable, vested and expected to vest as of   October 1, 2016   were calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the Class A common stock of   $14.84   as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  Restricted Stock Units 
    
  RSU activity under the equity incentive plans was as follows:

Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
    
  Total stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows (in thousands): 

As of   October 1, 2016  , the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options and RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, was   $226.4 million  , which the Company expects to recognize over an estimated weighted average period of   3.1   years.  

8.     Income Taxes 
     
  The Company is subject to income tax in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions in which it conducts business. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The Company does not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are to be reinvested indefinitely. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the Company recorded an expense for income taxes of   $18.3 million   and   $31.9 million  , respectively, for an effective tax rate of   41.2%   and   42.3%  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   is higher than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the effect of an out-of-period adjustment recorded in the three months ended April 2, 2016, the mix of income between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, unrecognized tax benefits, and a permanent domestic production activities deduction. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded an expense for income taxes of   $20.5 million   and   $66.0 million  , respectively, for an effective tax rate of   30.9%   and   37.2%  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was higher than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to certain permanent differences related to the change in fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability and non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by non-taxable income associated with contingent consideration from the FitStar acquisition and a permanent domestic production activities deduction. 

9.    Net Income per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders  
    
  Basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is presented in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. Prior to the Company s IPO in June 2015, the Company considered its redeemable convertible preferred stock to be participating securities. In accordance with the two-class method, earnings allocated to these participating securities and the related number of outstanding shares of the participating securities, which include contractual participation rights in undistributed earnings, have been excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders.  
    
  In connection with the IPO, the Company established   two   classes of authorized common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As a result, all then-outstanding shares of common stock were converted into shares of Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to   one   vote per share and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to   ten   votes per share. Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the stockholder into one share of Class A common stock, generally automatically converts into Class A common stock upon a transfer, and has no expiration date. The Company applies the two-class method of calculating earnings per share, or EPS, but as the dividend rights of both classes are identical, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for both classes.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. All participating securities are excluded from basic weighted-average common shares outstanding.  
    
  For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income attributable to common stockholders for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities. Diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, including all potentially dilutive common shares, if the effect of such shares is dilutive.  
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of the Company s basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

The following potentially dilutive common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share for the periods presented because including them would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):

10.    Significant Customer Information and Other Information 
    
  Retailer and Distributor Concentration 
    
  Retailers and distributors with revenue equal to or greater than 10% of total revenue for the three and   nine months ended October 1, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were as follows: 

Retailers and distributors that accounted for equal to or greater than 10% of accounts receivable at   October 1, 2016   and December 31,   2015   were as follows: 

Geographic and Other Information 
    
  Revenue by geographic region, based on ship-to destinations, was as follows (in thousands): 

As of   October 1, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , long-lived assets, which represent property and equipment, located outside the United States were   $53.0 million   and   $28.9 million  , respectively. 

11.   Acquisitions 
    
  2016 Acquisition 
    
  In May 2016, the Company completed a purchase of certain assets from a privately-held company, which was accounted for as a business combination, for total cash consideration of   $7.0 million  , of which   $3.9 million   was allocated to in-process research and development intangible assets, and   $3.1 million   to goodwill. This acquisition was not material to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  FitStar Acquisition   2015 
    
  In March 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding securities of FitStar, a privately-held company, for aggregate acquisition consideration of   $32.5 million  , comprised of   $13.3 million   related to the issuance of   1,059,688   shares of the Company s Class B common stock,   $11.5 million   of cash, and   $7.7 million   of contingent consideration. FitStar is a provider of interactive  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

video-based exercise experiences on mobile devices and computers that utilize proprietary algorithms to adjust and customize workouts for individual users. The acquisition is expected to enhance the Company s software and services offerings. 
    
  Under the acquisition agreement, the Company was obligated to issue additional common stock or pay cash to FitStar stockholders. The actual amount of any contingent consideration depended on market-based events that may occur in the future. The Company determined the fair market value of this contingent consideration to be   $7.7 million   as of the acquisition date using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The fair value of this liability was adjusted at each reporting period, and the change in fair value is included in total operating expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  As a result of the Company s IPO, the Company recorded a change in fair value of   $7.7 million   as a benefit and as of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability was   zero  . In addition, the terms related to the contingent consideration expired as of December 31, 2015 and no amounts were paid or shares issued for the contingent consideration. 
    
  The following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands): 

The amortization periods of the acquired developed technology, customer relationships, and trademarks are   7.0 years  ,   1.3 years  , and   5.0 years  , respectively. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 
    
  In addition, upon acquisition, the Company issued   308,216   additional shares of common stock valued at   $4.2 million  . The Company is also obligated to make cash payments up to   $1.2 million  . Both the common stock and the cash payments are additional consideration which is contingent upon former employees of FitStar continuing to be employed by the Company. As such, this additional consideration was not part of the purchase price and is recognized as post-acquisition compensation expense over the related requisite service period of   three   years. The Company also recorded acquisition-related transaction costs of   $0.3 million  , which were included in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  The results of operations for both acquired companies are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. Pro forma and historical results of operations for both acquired companies have not been presented because they are not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  As discussed in the section titled  Note About Forward-Looking Statements,  the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled  Risk Factors  included under Part II, Item 1A below. 

Change to Quarterly Reporting Calendar 
  Our fiscal year ends on December 31 of each year. In the first quarter of 2016, we adopted a 4-4-5 week quarterly calendar, which, for the 2016 fiscal year, is comprised of four fiscal quarters ending on April 2, 2016, July 2, 2016, October 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016. We did not adjust operating results for quarters prior to 2016. There were 91 and 92 days in the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and 275 and 273 days in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Overview 
    
  Our mission is to help people lead healthier, more active lives by empowering them with data, inspiration, and guidance to reach their goals. 
    
  Fitbit is transforming the way millions of people around the world achieve their health and fitness goals. The Fitbit platform combines connected health and fitness devices with software and services, including an online dashboard and mobile apps, data analytics, motivational and social tools, personalized insights, and virtual coaching through customized fitness plans and interactive workouts. Our platform helps people become more active, exercise more, sleep better, eat smarter, and manage their weight. Fitbit appeals to a large, mainstream health and fitness market by addressing these key needs with advanced technology embedded in simple-to-use products and services. We pioneered the connected health and fitness market starting in 2007, and since then, we have grown into a leading global health and fitness brand.  
    
  The core of our platform is our family of wearable connected health and fitness trackers. These wrist-based and  clippable  devices automatically track users  daily steps, calories burned, distance traveled, and active minutes and display real-time feedback to encourage them to become more active in their daily lives. Most of our trackers also measure floors climbed, sleep duration and quality, and our more advanced products track heart rate and GPS-based information such as speed, distance, and exercise routes. Several of our devices also feature deeper integration with smartphones, such as the ability to receive call and text notifications and control music. To accompany certain of our products, we offer accessories that include interchangeable wrist bands and frames, colored clips, device charging cables, wireless sync dongles, band clasps, sleep bands, and Fitbit apparel. In addition, we offer a Wi-Fi connected scale that records weight, body fat, and BMI. We are able to enhance the functionality and features of our connected devices through wireless updates. Our platform also includes our online dashboard and mobile apps, which wirelessly and automatically sync with our devices. Our platform allows our users to see trends and achievements, access motivational tools such as virtual badges and real-time progress notifications, and connect, support, and compete with friends and family. We intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development in order to enhance our products and services. 
    
  During the three months ended October 1, 2016, we announced two new devices, Fitbit Charge 2 and Fitbit Flex 2.  
    
  Fitbit Charge 2   replaces Fitbit Charge HR and Fitbit Charge, and is a wireless heart rate and activity wristband that we began selling in August 2016. Fitbit Charge 2 features connected GPS through a user s smartphone s GPS, PurePulse heart rate tracking, and SmartTrack automatic exercise recognition. It provides an estimate of the user s cardio fitness level, features guided breathing sessions, and provides text and call notifications. Fitbit Charge 2 measures daily activities such as steps, distance, calories burned, floors climbed, and active minutes and automatically tracks sleep at night. Fitbit Charge 2 also features a slim design, easily interchangeable bands, and a tap-sensitive display. Fitbit Charge 2 is available in four colors and three sizes, and uses a rechargeable battery that lasts up to five days. Fitbit Charge 2 has a U.S. MSRP of $149.95. 
    
  Fitbit Flex 2   replaces Fitbit Flex, and is our first water-resistant fitness wristband. We began selling Fitbit Flex 2 in September 2016. Fitbit Flex 2 is water resistant up to 50 meters, and automatically tracks pool swims including laps, duration and calories burned in the Fitbit App. It features SmartTrack automatic exercise recognition, measures daily activities such as steps, distance, calories burned, and active minutes, and automatically tracks sleep at night. Fitbit Flex 2 also features a slim design, easily

interchangeable bands, and LED lights to show progress toward a user s daily goal. Fitbit Flex 2 is available in four colors and two sizes, and uses a rechargeable battery that lasts up to five days. Fitbit Flex 2 has a U.S. MSRP of $99.95. 
    
  We design our products primarily in California and outsource the production of our devices to contract manufacturers, which are responsible for procuring most of the components used in the manufacturing of our products from third-party suppliers. We also outsource packaging and fulfillment to third-party logistics providers around the world. 
    
  We generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of our connected health and fitness devices. We sell our products in over 54,000 retail stores and in 65 countries, through our retailers  websites, through our online store at Fitbit.com, and as part of our corporate wellness offering. We seek to build global brand awareness, increase product adoption, and drive sales through our sales and marketing efforts. We intend to continue to significantly invest in these sales and marketing efforts in the future. 
    
  Our growth will depend in part on the adoption and sale of our products and services in international markets. In the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , 27% of our revenue, based on ship-to destinations, was from sales outside of the United States. We believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for us. However, we have recently experienced, and may experience in the future, a decline in growth rates in the APAC region. We intend to expand sales of our products and services in new and existing international markets by expanding our distribution channels through select retailers and strategic partnerships. We also intend to continue to invest across all geographic regions in sales and marketing efforts, including increasing our global advertising efforts, and in infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion, including establishing additional sales offices globally. Our international expansion efforts have resulted, and will continue to result, in increased costs and are subject to a variety of risks, including increased competition, uncertain enforcement of our intellectual property rights, more complex distribution logistics, and the complexity of compliance with foreign laws and regulations. 
    
  The following are financial highlights for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

See the section titled   Key Business Metrics  for additional information regarding devices sold and adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income. 

Key Business Metrics 
    
  In addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts, and make strategic decisions. 
    
  Devices Sold 
    
  Devices sold represents the number of connected health and fitness devices that are sold during a period, net of expected returns and provisions for the Fitbit Force recall. Devices sold does not include sales of accessories. Growth rates between devices sold and revenue are not necessarily correlated because our revenue is affected by other variables, such as the types of products sold during the period, the introduction of new product offerings that have different U.S. manufacturer s suggested retail prices, and sales of accessories and premium services. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, we monitor and consider adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by U.S. GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. 

28 

     Table of Contents  

We define adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude the impact of the Fitbit Force recall, stock-based compensation expense, litigation expense related to matters with Aliphcom, Inc. d/b/a Jawbone, or Jawbone, the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, depreciation and intangible assets amortization, change in contingent consideration, interest income (expense), net, and income tax expense.  
    
  We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and trends and make planning decisions. We believe that adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses and other items that we exclude in adjusted EBITDA. In particular, the exclusion of the effect of the Fitbit Force recall, which primarily impacted our results for the fourth quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014, and the fourth quarter of 2015 discussed in   Fitbit Force Product Recall  and certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Additionally, we use this measure to evaluate our operating performance and trends and make planning decisions. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to a key financial metric used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of this non-GAAP financial measure rather than net income, which is the nearest U.S. GAAP equivalent of adjusted EBITDA. For example, adjusted EBITDA excludes the Fitbit Force recall, which primarily impacted our results for the fourth quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014, and the fourth quarter of 2015, and which had a negative impact on our revenue and expenses during these periods. In addition, adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. Furthermore, we exclude litigation expenses related to matters with Jawbone because we do not believe these expenses have a direct correlation to the operations of our business and because of the singular nature of the claims underlying the Jawbone litigation matters. We began excluding Jawbone related litigation expense in the three months ended July 2, 2016 as these costs significantly increased during the second quarter of 2016, and may continue to be material for the remainder of 2016. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):   

Components of our Operating Results 
    
  Revenue 
    
  We generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our connected health and fitness devices and accessories. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from our subscription-based premium services.

     Table of Contents  

Cost of Revenue 
    
  Cost of revenue consists of product costs, including costs of contract manufacturers for production, shipping and handling costs, warranty replacement costs, packaging, costs related to the Fitbit Force recall, fulfillment costs, manufacturing and tooling equipment depreciation, warehousing costs, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired, and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses and other expenses associated with supply chain logistics. Personnel-related expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  Operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. 
    
  Research and Development  . Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, and allocated overhead costs. 
    
  Substantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant. 
    
  Sales and Marketing.   Sales and marketing expenses represent a significant component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products and services and personnel-related expenses, as well as sales incentives, trade show and event costs, sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, point of purchase, or POP, display expenses and related amortization, and allocated overhead costs.  
    
  General and Administrative  . General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, as well as the costs of professional services, allocated overhead, information technology, amortization of intangible assets acquired, and other administrative expenses.  
    
  Change in contingent consideration.   The change in contingent consideration relates to the benefit received during 2015 from the reversal of a contingent liability incurred in connection with the acquisition of FitStar. See Note 11 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
    
  Interest Income (Expense), Net 
    
  Interest income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, and amortization of debt issuance costs. 
    
  Other Income (Expense), Net 
    
  Other income (expense), net consists of mark-to-market adjustments for the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability prior to our IPO and foreign currency gains and losses. 
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the utilization of foreign tax credits, and changes in tax laws. 

Fitbit Force Product Recall 
    
  In March 2014, we recalled the Fitbit Force after some of our users experienced allergic reactions to adhesives in the wristband. This recall primarily impacted our results for the fourth quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014, and the fourth quarter of 2015. We established a reserve for the Fitbit Force recall after considering various factors including cost estimates for customer returns, logistics and handling fees for managing product returns and processing refunds, obsolescence of on-hand inventory, cancellation charges for existing purchase commitments, rework of component inventory with the contract manufacturer, legal fees and settlement costs, and write-offs of tooling and manufacturing equipment.

Revenue 

Revenue increased $94.5 million, or 23%, from $409.3 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to $503.8 million for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  . A substantial majority of the increase was due to an increase in the average selling price of our devices by 11% from $84 per device for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to $93 per device for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , driven by new products introduced in 2016, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price for certain legacy products. Revenue from new products introduced in 2016 was $398.5 million, or 79% of revenue, for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  . An increase in the number of devices sold, from 4.8 million in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to 5.3 million in the three months ended   October 1, 2016   also contributed to the increase in revenue. During the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , a higher percentage of the quarter s shipments was made in the last month of the quarter as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , driven primarily by the new products introduced in the third quarter of 2016. During the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , we recorded $15.0 million of revenue related to an agreement with a third party to exchange inventory for advertising credits and cash. 
    
  U.S. revenue, based on ship-to destinations, increased $90.4 million, or 33%, from $270.8 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to $361.2 million for three months ended   October 1, 2016  . International revenue, based on ship-to destinations, increased by $4.2 million, or 3%, from $138.4 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to $142.6 million for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in revenue in the EMEA region by 64%, partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the APAC region by 45%. 
    
  Revenue increased $449.3 million, or 39%, from $1.1 billion for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $1.6 billion for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . A substantial majority of the increase was due to an increase in the average selling price of our devices by 13% from $86 per device for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $97 per device for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , driven by new products introduced in 2016. Revenue from new products introduced in 2016 was $967.2 million, or 61% of revenue, for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . Revenue also increased due to an increase in the number of devices sold, from 13.1 million in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to 15.8 million in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  .

U.S. revenue, based on ship-to destinations, increased $309.3 million, or 36%, from $848.8 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $1.2 billion for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and international revenue, based on ship-to destinations, increased by $140.0 million, or 47%, from $297.6 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $437.6 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in revenue in the EMEA region by 106%, partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the APAC region by 11%. 
    
  For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase in absolute dollars as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, however, we expect the growth rate to be substantially lower than our historical growth rates. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue increased $49.9 million, or 23%, from $213.2 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to $263.1 million for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in average cost per device related to new products introduced in 2016 and an increase in the number of devices sold. Cost of revenue increased $282.6 million, or 48%, from $593.7 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $876.3 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in average cost per device related to new products introduced in 2016, an increase in the number of devices sold, and an increase in estimated costs of warranty claims for legacy products. 
    
  Gross margin was 48% for each of the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , and decreased from 48% for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to 45% for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . The gross margin of 48% for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   was impacted by an increase in estimated costs of warranty claims for legacy products, offset primarily by reduced costs on certain warranty replacement units. The decrease in gross margin for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in estimated costs of warranty claims for legacy products.  

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses increased $40.1 million, or 93%, from $42.9 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to $83.0 million for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to a $24.2 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 105% increase in headcount, an $11.0 million increase in allocated overhead, a $4.2 million increase in consultant and contractor expenses, travel expenses, and expenses for third-party hosting services, and a $2.9 million increase in tooling and prototype materials, partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in corporate bonus expense. 
    
  Research and development expenses increased $139.3 million, or 145%, from $95.8 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $235.1 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to a $79.2 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 105% increase in headcount, a $32.0 million increase in allocated overhead, an $11.2 million increase in consultant and contractor expenses, a $9.4 million increase in tooling and prototype materials, a $3.5 million increase in travel expenses, and a $2.6 million increase in expenses for third-party hosting services. 
    
  For the fourth quarter of 2016 and the full year 2016, we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as compared to the same periods in 2015 as we continue to make significant investments in developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services.

Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses increased $14.8 million, or 23%, from $65.1 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to $80.0 million for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to a $14.2 million increase in consulting and contractor expenses, a $5.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 74% increase in headcount, a $1.7 million increase in expenses for purchased software, and a $1.7 million increase in advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by a $7.3 million decrease in allocated overhead, and a $1.1 million decrease in corporate bonus expense. 
    
  Sales and marketing expenses increased $126.4 million, or 71%, from $178.7 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $305.1 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to a $80.0 million increase in expenses associated with advertising costs and other marketing programs, driven by the launch of media campaigns for the new products introduced during 2016. The increase was also due to a $38.9 million increase in consulting and contractor expenses, a $17.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 74% increase in headcount, and a $3.8 million increase in expenses for purchased software, partially offset by a $15.3 million decrease in allocated overhead. 
    
  For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as compared to the fourth quarter 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue as compared to the full year 2015.  

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses increased $12.6 million, or 61%, from $20.7 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to $33.3 million for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in legal fees, a $5.0 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to an 89% increase in headcount, a $2.2 million increase in consulting and contractor expenses, and a $1.8 million increase in other administrative expenses and travel expenses, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in corporate bonus expense. 
    
  General and administrative expenses increased $58.0 million, or 120%, from $48.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $106.3 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to a $24.0 million increase in legal fees, an $18.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to a 89% increase in headcount, an $11.3 million increase in consulting and contractor expenses, a $4.1 million increase in other administrative expenses and travel expenses. 
    
  For the full year 2016, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue as compared to the full year 2015. 

Change in Contingent Consideration 

The change in contingent consideration benefit of $7.7 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   is a result of our re-measurement of the contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of FitStar in 2015. This is a non-recurring benefit. The terms of the contingent liability expired as of December 31, 2015.

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net 

Interest income (expense), net increased $1.2 million, or 549%, from expense of $0.2 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to income of $1.0 million for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  . Other income (expense), net, decreased $0.3 million, or 39%, from expense of $0.7 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to expense of $1.0 million for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  .  
    
  Interest income (expense), net increased $3.5 million, or 325%, from expense of $1.1 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to income of $2.4 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . Other income (expense), net, increased $59.2 million, from expense of $59.1 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to income of $68 thousand for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . The increase in other income (expense), net was primarily due to a decrease of $56.7 million in charges related to the revaluation of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability as the liability is no longer outstanding subsequent to our IPO. 

Income Tax Expense  

Income tax expense decreased $2.2 million, or 11%, from an expense of $20.5 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to $18.3 million for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  . Our effective tax rate was 41.2% and 30.9% for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   was primarily due to a change in the mix of income between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. 
    
  Income tax expense decreased $34.1 million, or 52%, from an expense of $66.0 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $31.9 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . Our effective tax rate was 42.3% and 37.2% for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   was primarily due to the effect of an out-of-period adjustment recorded in the three months ended April 2, 2016, partially offset by the growth of international operations in lower tax jurisdictions, and research and development tax credits. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our operations have been financed primarily through cash flow from operating activities, the net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities, and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of   October 1, 2016  , we had total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $672.1 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $284.2 million and marketable securities of $387.9 million. 
    
  We believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our levels of revenue, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, acquisitions, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. 
    
  Credit Facility 
    
  In December 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement, or Senior Facility, that allows us to borrow up to $250.0 million, including up to $50.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million for swing line loans. For further information regarding the Senior Facility, see Note 5 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  As of   October 1, 2016  , there were   no   outstanding borrowings under the Senior Facility. As of   October 1, 2016  , we had outstanding letters of credit totaling   $37.9 million  , issued to cover various security deposits on our facility leases. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities of $40.2 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   was primarily due to net income of $43.5 million and non-cash adjustments of $31.8 million, partially offset by a $35.1 million decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities of $125.5 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily due to net income of $111.5 million and non-cash adjustments of $60.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $46.3 million.  
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   of $330.9 million was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of $552.8 million, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $249.3 million. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included purchases of property and equipment of $66.8 million and cash paid for an acquisition of $5.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   of $141.4 million was due to the purchases of marketable securities of $124.7 million, partially offset by the sale of marketable securities of $12.1 million. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included purchases of property and equipment of $17.7 million and the cash portion of the acquisition of FitStar of $11.0 million. 
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Cash provided by financing activities for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   of $39.4 million was primarily due to excess tax benefits of $25.5 million from stock-based compensation, and $18.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases made through our ESPP. Cash provided by financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   of $282.6 million was primarily related to proceeds from our IPO of $420.9 million, and net repayments of borrowings of $134.5 million under our credit facilities. 

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 
    
  Future minimum payments under our operating leases as of   October 1, 2016   were $305.2 million. 
    
  The aggregate amount of purchase orders open as of   October 1, 2016   was approximately $495.4 million. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent  
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. During the normal course of business, we and our contract manufacturers procure components based upon a forecasted production plan. If we cancel all or part of the orders, we may be liable to our suppliers and contract manufacturers for the cost of the unutilized component orders or components purchased by our contract manufactures. 
    
  We have recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of $33.8 million as of   October 1, 2016  , due to the uncertainty of when the related tax settlements will become due. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or holdings in variable interest entities. 

Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates 
    
  Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  
    
  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate and foreign currency risks as follows: 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. As of   October 1, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of $284.2 million and marketable securities of $387.9 million, which consisted primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate notes and bonds. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity without significantly increasing risk. Our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue, issuer, or type of investment.  
    
  To date, we have not been exposed, nor do we anticipate being exposed, to material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
    
  To date, all of our inventory purchases have been denominated in U.S. dollars. Our international sales are primarily denominated in foreign currencies and any unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the currencies in which we conduct sales in foreign countries could have an adverse impact on our revenue. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, our suppliers incur many costs, including labor costs, in other currencies. To the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a material impact on our gross margins. Our operating results and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  
    
  To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses, we enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged.  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

We had outstanding contracts with a total notional amount of   $283.2 million   and   $63.3 million   in cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue and expense transactions, respectively, as of   October 1, 2016  . We had outstanding balance sheet hedges with a total notional amount of   $141.0 million   as of   October 1, 2016  . We assessed our exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations. Based on transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars as of   October 1, 2016  , a hypothetical adverse change of 10% would have resulted in an impact on income before income taxes of approximately $25.3 million for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  . Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13-a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) as of   October 1, 2016  . Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of   October 1, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.   There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 6,  Commitments and Contingencies,  in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Further, we are and, from time to time, we may become, involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any other legal proceedings that in the opinion of our management, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  An investment in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and uncertainties. If any of these risks actually occurs, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. Our business, operating results, financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. 
    
  Risks Related to Our Business 
    
  We operate in a highly competitive market. If we do not compete effectively, our prospects, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
    
  The connected health and fitness devices market is highly competitive, with companies offering a variety of competitive products and services. We expect competition in our market to intensify in the future as new and existing competitors introduce new or enhanced products and services that are potentially more competitive than our products and services. The connected health and fitness devices market has a multitude of participants, including specialized consumer electronics companies, such as Garmin, Jawbone, and Misfit, traditional health and fitness companies, such as adidas and Under Armour, and traditional watch companies such as Fossil and Movado. In addition, many large, broad-based consumer electronics companies either compete in our market or adjacent markets or have announced plans to do so, including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, and Samsung. For example, Apple sells the Apple Watch, which is a smartwatch with broad-based functionalities, including some health and fitness tracking capabilities, and Apple has sold a significant volume of its smartwatches since introduction. Moreover, smartwatches with health and fitness functionalities may displace the market for traditional connected health and fitness devices. We may also face competition from manufacturers of lower-cost devices, such as Xiaomi and its Mi Band device. In addition, we compete with a wide range of stand-alone health and fitness-related mobile apps that can be purchased or downloaded through mobile app stores. We believe many of our competitors and potential competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, ability to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products and services, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a larger number of suppliers, contract manufacturers, and channel partners, greater brand recognition, ability to leverage app stores which they may operate, and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we do. Our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours, achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services, and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do. Some of our competitors may aggressively discount their products and services in order to gain market share, which could result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, lost market share, or a failure to grow market share for us. In addition, new products may have lower selling prices or higher costs than legacy products, which could negatively impact our gross margins and operating results. Furthermore, current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources. As a result of such acquisitions, our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and consumer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their products and services more quickly than we do. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current or potential competitors, our prospects, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

If we are unable to anticipate and satisfy consumer preferences in a timely manner, our business may be adversely affected. 
    
  Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and satisfy consumer preferences in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Consumers may decide not to purchase our products and services as their preferences could shift rapidly to different types of connected health and fitness devices or away from these types of products and services altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to shifts in consumer preferences. In addition, our newer products and services that have additional features or new product designs, such as the Fitbit Charge 2, Fitbit Flex 2, Fitbit Blaze, and Fitbit Alta may have higher prices than many of our earlier products and the products of some of our competitors, which may not appeal to consumers or only appeal to a smaller subset of consumers. It is also possible that competitors could introduce new products and services that negatively impact consumer preference for our connected health and fitness devices, which could result in decreased sales of our products and services and a loss in market share. Accordingly, if we fail to anticipate and satisfy consumer preferences in a timely manner, or if it is perceived that our future products and services will not satisfy consumer preferences, our business may be adversely affected. 
    
  If we are unable to successfully develop and timely introduce new products and services or enhance existing products and services, our business may be adversely affected. 
    
  We must continually develop and introduce new products, including trackers and accessories, and services and improve and enhance our existing products and services to maintain or increase our sales. The success of new or enhanced products and services may depend on a number of factors including, anticipating and effectively addressing consumer preferences and demand, the success of our sales and marketing efforts, timely and successful research and development, effective forecasting and management of product demand, purchase commitments, and inventory levels, effective management of manufacturing and supply costs, and the quality of or defects in our products. 
    
  The development of our products and services is complex and costly, and we typically have several products and services in development at the same time. Given the complexity, we occasionally have experienced, and could experience in the future, delays in completing the development and introduction of new and enhanced products and services. For example, we experienced supply constraints relating to the production of Fitbit Flex 2 during the third quarter of 2016. Problems in the design or quality of our products or services may also have an adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition, and operating results. Unanticipated problems in developing products and services could also divert substantial research and development resources, which may impair our ability to develop new products and services and enhancements of existing products and services, and could substantially increase our costs. In addition, we have recently begun to offer new accessory collections in conjunction with new product introductions. If new or enhanced product and service introductions are delayed or not successful, we may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our research and development efforts, and our business may be adversely affected. 
    
  Our operating results could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and services and adequately manage our inventory. 
    
  To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with our suppliers and contract manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products, including trackers and accessories, and services could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products and services or for products and services of our competitors, product and service introductions by competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and the weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Due to the growth in demand for our connected health and fitness devices, and particularly in connection with new product introductions, we face challenges acquiring adequate and timely supplies of our products to satisfy the levels of demand, which we believe negatively affects our revenue. This risk may be exacerbated by the fact that we may not carry a significant amount of inventory, either directly or with our contract manufacturers or logistics providers to satisfy short-term demand increases. In addition, as we continue to introduce new products, we may face challenges managing the inventory of existing products. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale. 
    
  Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would cause our gross margin to suffer and could impair the strength of our brand. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products and services, our contract manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in damage to our brand and customer relationships and adversely affect our revenue and operating results.

Our quarterly operating results or other operating metrics may fluctuate significantly, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. 
    
  Our quarterly operating results and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We expect that this trend will continue as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including: 

the level of demand for our connected health and fitness devices and our ability to maintain or increase the size and engagement of our community of users; 
                
    the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us and the transition from legacy products; 
                
    the timing and success of new product and service introductions by our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our market; 
                
    the mix of products sold in a quarter; 
                
    the continued market acceptance of, and the growth of the market for, connected health and fitness devices; 
                
    pricing pressure as a result of competition or otherwise; 
                
    delays or disruptions in our supply, manufacturing, or distribution chain; 
                
    errors in our forecasting of the demand for our products, which could lead to lower revenue or increased costs, or both; 
                
    seasonal buying patterns of consumers; 
                
    increases in levels of channel inventory resulting from sales to our retailers and distributors in anticipation of future demand; 
                
    increases in and timing of sales and marketing and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive; 
                
    insolvency, credit, or other difficulties faced by our distributors and retailers, affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our products; 
                
    insolvency, credit, or other difficulties confronting our suppliers, contract manufacturers, or logistics providers leading to disruptions in our supply or distribution chain; 
                
    levels of product returns, stock rotation, and price protection rights; 
                
    adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs; 
                
    changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, such as with respect to privacy, information security, health and wellness devices, consumer product safety, and advertising; 
                
    product recalls, regulatory proceedings, or other adverse publicity about our products; 
                
    fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; 
                
    costs related to the acquisition of businesses, talent, technologies, or intellectual property, including potentially significant amortization costs and possible write-downs; and 
                
    general economic conditions in either domestic or international markets. 
       
  Any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results. 
    
  The variability and unpredictability of our quarterly operating results or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of any analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other operating results for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. 
    
  We rely on a limited number of suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers, and each of our products is manufactured by a single contract manufacturer. 
    
  We rely on a limited number of suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers. In particular, we use contract manufacturers located in Asia, and each of our products is manufactured by a single contract manufacturer. Our reliance on a sole contract manufacturer for each of our products increases the risk that in the event of an interruption from any one of these contract manufacturers, including without limitation, due to a natural catastrophe or labor dispute, we may not be able to develop an alternate source without incurring material additional costs and substantial delays. Accordingly, an interruption from any key supplier, contract manufacturer, or logistics provider could adversely impact our revenue, gross margins, and operating results.  
    
  If we experience significantly increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier, contract manufacturer, or logistics provider, we may be unable to supplement or replace such supply, contract manufacturing, or logistics capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, which may undermine our ability to deliver our products to customers in a timely manner. For example, for certain of our products, it may take a significant amount of time to identify a contract manufacturer that has the capability and resources to build the product to our specifications in sufficient volume. Identifying suitable suppliers, contract manufacturers,  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

and logistics providers is an extensive process that requires us to become satisfied with their quality control, technical capabilities, responsiveness and service, financial stability, regulatory compliance, and labor and other ethical practices. Accordingly, a loss of any key supplier, contract manufacturer, or logistics provider could adversely impact our revenue, gross margins, and operating results. 
    
  Because many of the key components in our products come from limited or sole sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain. 
    
  Many of the key components used to manufacture our products come from limited or sole sources of supply. Our contract manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf, subject to certain approved supplier lists. We are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience component shortages, and the predictability of the availability of these components may be limited. While component shortages have historically been immaterial, they could be material in the future. In the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from suppliers of these components, we may not be able to develop alternate sources in a timely manner. In addition, some of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers may have more established relationships with our competitors, and as a result of such relationships, such suppliers may choose to limit or terminate their relationship with us. Developing alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming, difficult, and costly and we may not be able to source these components on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may undermine our ability to meet our requirements or to fill our orders in a timely manner. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components, or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers and users. This could harm our relationships with our channel partners and users and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, increased component costs could result in lower gross margins. If we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers and users. 
    
  Our current and future products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in adverse publicity, product recalls, litigation, regulatory proceedings, and warranty claims resulting in significant direct or indirect costs, decreased revenue and operating margin, and harm to our brand. 
    
  We sell complex products and services that could contain design and manufacturing defects in their materials, hardware, and firmware. These defects could include defective materials or components, or  bugs  that can unexpectedly interfere with the products  intended operations or cause injuries to users or property. For example, we recently corrected certain software errors relating to Fitbit Charge 2 through a software update. Although we extensively and rigorously test new and enhanced products and services before their release, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all defects. For example, our products may fail to provide accurate measurements and data to users, or there may be reports or claims of inaccurate measurements.  
    
  Failure to detect, prevent, or fix defects, or an increase in defects could result in a variety of consequences including a greater number of returns of products than expected from users and retailers, increases in warranty costs, regulatory proceedings, product recalls, and litigation, which could harm our revenue and operating results. We generally provide a 45-day right of return for purchases through Fitbit.com and a 12-month warranty on all of our products, except in the European Union, where we provide a two-year warranty on all of our products. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in our current and future products could expose us to warranty claims in excess of our current reserves. As of December 31, 2015, our reserves for warranty claims were $40.2 million, or 2% of our revenue for 2015. As of   October 1, 2016  , our reserves for warranty claims were $62.9 million. Moreover, we offer limited stock rotation rights and price protection to our distributors. If we experience greater returns from retailers or users, or greater warranty claims, in excess of our reserves, our business, revenue, gross margins, and operating results could be harmed. In addition, any negative publicity or lawsuits filed against us related to the perceived quality and safety of our products could also affect our brand and decrease demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
    
  We have limited control over our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers, which subjects us to significant risks, including the potential inability to obtain or produce quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. 
    
  We have limited control over our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers, including aspects of their specific manufacturing processes and their labor, environmental, or other practices, which subjects us to significant risks, including the following: 

inability to satisfy demand for our products; 
     
   42 

     Table of Contents  

reduced control over delivery timing and product reliability; 
                
    reduced ability to oversee the manufacturing process and components used in our products; 
                
    reduced ability to monitor compliance with our product manufacturing specifications; 
                
    price increases; 
                
    difficulties in establishing additional or alternative contract manufacturing relationships if we experience difficulties with our existing contract manufacturers; 
                
    shortages of materials or components; 
                
    misappropriation of our intellectual property; 
                
    suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers may choose to limit or terminate their relationship with us; 
                
    exposure to natural catastrophes, political unrest, terrorism, labor disputes, and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; 
                
    changes in local economic conditions in countries where our suppliers, contract manufacturers, or logistics providers are located; 
                
    the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes, and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on currency exchange or the transfer of funds; and 
                
    insufficient warranties and indemnities on components supplied to our contract manufacturers. 
       
  If there are defects in the manufacture of our products, we may face negative publicity, government investigations, and litigation, and we may not be fully compensated by our contract manufacturers for any financial or other liability that we suffer as a result. 
    
  We are, and may in the future, be subject to claims and lawsuits alleging that our products fail to provide accurate measurements and data to our users. 
    
  Our products are used to track and display various information about users  activities, such as daily steps taken, calories burned, distance traveled, floors climbed, active minutes, sleep duration and quality, and heart rate and GPS-based information such as speed, distance, and exercise routes. We anticipate new features and functionality in the future, as well. From time to time, there have been reports and claims made against us alleging that our products do not provide accurate measurements and data to users, including claims asserting that certain features of our products do not operate as advertised. Such reports and claims have resulted in negative publicity, and, in some cases, have required us to expend time and resources to defend litigation. For example, in the first quarter of 2016, class action lawsuits were filed against us based upon claims that the PurePulse heart rate tracking technology in the Fitbit Charge HR and Fitbit Surge do not consistently and accurately record users  heart rates. If our products fail to provide accurate measurements and data to users, or if there are reports or claims of inaccurate measurements, claims of false advertisement, or claims regarding the overall health benefits of our products and services in the future, we may become the subject of negative publicity, litigation, including class action litigation, regulatory proceedings, and warranty claims, and our brand, operating results, and business could be harmed. 
    
  The failure to effectively manage the introduction of new or enhanced products may adversely affect our operating results. 
    
  We must successfully manage introductions of new or enhanced products. Introductions of new or enhanced products, including trackers and accessories, could adversely impact the sales of our existing products to retailers and consumers. For instance, retailers often purchase less of our existing products in advance of new product launches. Furthermore, we may experience greater returns from retailers or users of existing products or retailers may be granted stock rotation rights and price protection. Moreover, consumers may decide to purchase new or enhanced products instead of existing products. We may face challenges managing the inventory of existing products, which could lead to excess inventory and discounting of our existing products. In addition, new products may have lower selling prices or higher costs than legacy products, which could negatively impact our gross margins and operating results.  We have also historically incurred higher levels of sales and marketing expenses accompanying each product introduction. Accordingly, if we fail to effectively manage introductions of new or enhanced products, our operating results could be harmed. 
    
  An economic downturn or economic uncertainty may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products and services. 
    
  Our products and services may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, and other factors, such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession, the availability and cost of consumer credit, levels of unemployment, and tax rates. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, including economic conditions resulting  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

from recent volatility in European markets, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and services and consumer demand for our products and services may not grow as we expect. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand for our products and services may have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
    
  The market for connected health and fitness devices is still in the early stages of growth and if it does not continue to grow, grows more slowly than we expect, or fails to grow as large as we expect, our business and operating results would be harmed. 
    
  The market for connected health and fitness devices is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether connected health and fitness devices will sustain high levels of demand and wide market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt these products and services. In part, adoption of our products and services will depend on the increasing prevalence of connected health and fitness devices as well as new entrants to the connected health and fitness device market to raise the profile of both the market as a whole and our own platform. Our connected health and fitness devices have largely been used to measure and track activities such as walking, running, and sleeping. However, they have not been as widely adopted for other sports, exercise, and activities such as cycling, skiing, and swimming for which other niche products are more often used. Furthermore, some individuals may be reluctant or unwilling to use connected health and fitness devices because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with data privacy and security. If the wider public does not perceive the benefits of our connected health and fitness devices or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding privacy or data security or for other reasons, then the market for these products and services may not further develop, it may develop more slowly than we expect, or it may not achieve the growth potential we expect it to, any of which would adversely affect our operating results. The development and growth of this relatively new market may also prove to be a short-term trend. 
    
  Our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights, or claims by others that we are infringing upon or unlawfully using their intellectual property could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
    
  We currently rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees, independent contractors, commercial partners, and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We cannot be certain that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of such rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent or trademark protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications or apply for all necessary or desirable trademark applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We have obtained and applied for U.S. and foreign trademark registrations for the  Fitbit  brand and a variety of our product names, and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. However, we cannot guarantee that any of our pending trademark or patent applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our intellectual property rights by other parties in these countries. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and our failure or inability to obtain or maintain trade secret protection or otherwise protect our proprietary rights could adversely affect our business. 
    
  We are and may in the future be subject to patent infringement and trademark claims and lawsuits in various jurisdictions, and we cannot be certain that our products or activities do not violate the patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights of third-party claimants. Companies in the technology industry and other patent, copyright, and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and frequently commence litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. As we face increasing competition, the intellectual property rights claims against us and asserted by us have grown and will likely continue to grow. For example, we are currently involved in litigation with Jawbone, which is described in Note 6,  Commitments and Contingencies  in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  We intend to vigorously defend and prosecute these litigation matters and, based on our review, we believe we have valid defenses and claims with respect to each of these matters. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against us or any adverse settlement could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. In addition, litigation can involve significant management time and attention and can be expensive, regardless  
  
   44 

     Table of Contents  

of outcome. During the course of these litigation matters, there may be announcements of the results of hearings and motions, and other interim developments related to the litigation matters. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline. 
    
  Further, from time to time, we have received and may continue to receive letters from third parties alleging that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability, prevent us from selling some of our products and services, or require us to change our branding. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights from third parties at a significant expense, or cease using those rights altogether. We have also in the past and may in the future bring claims against third parties for infringing our intellectual property rights. Costs of supporting such litigation and disputes may be considerable, and there can be no assurances that a favorable outcome will be obtained. Patent infringement, trademark infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and other intellectual property claims and proceedings brought against us or brought by us, whether successful or not, could require significant attention of our management and resources and have in the past and could further result in substantial costs, harm to our brand, and have an adverse effect on our business. 
    
  We may not be able to sustain our revenue growth or profitability in the future. 
    
  Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. As we continue to grow our business, we expect our revenue growth to slow in future periods due to a number of reasons, which may include slowing demand for our products and services, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities, or the maturation of our business. Due to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors, or other factors, the average selling price or gross margins of our products and services may decrease. If we are unable to offset any decreases in our average selling price or gross margins by increasing our sales volumes or by adjusting our product mix, our operating results and financial condition may be harmed. 
    
  While we have been profitable since 2014, we have not consistently achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. We expect expenses to increase substantially in the near term, particularly as we make significant investments in our research and development and sales and marketing, expand our operations and infrastructure both domestically and internationally, develop new products and services, and enhance our existing products and services. In addition, we expect to incur additional significant legal, accounting, and other expenses in connection with operating as a public company. If our revenue does not increase to offset these increases in our operating expenses, we may not be profitable in future periods. 
    
  Our operating margins may decline as a result of increasing product costs and operating expenses. 
    
  Our business is subject to significant pressure on pricing and costs caused by many factors, including intense competition, the cost of components used in our products, labor costs, constrained sourcing capacity, inflationary pressure, pressure from users to reduce the prices we charge for our products and services, warranty claims, and changes in consumer demand. Costs for the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are affected by, among other things, energy prices, consumer demand, fluctuations in commodity prices and currency, and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. Increases in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our products or in the cost of labor and other costs of doing business in the United States and internationally could have an adverse effect on, among other things, the cost of our products, gross margins, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. Moreover, if we are unable to offset any decreases in our average selling price by increasing our sales volumes or by adjusting our product mix, our operating results and financial condition may be harmed.  
    
  In addition, we expect expenses to increase substantially in the near term, particularly as we make significant investments in our research and development and sales and marketing organizations, expand our operations and infrastructure both domestically and internationally, develop new products and services, and enhance our existing products and services. In addition, we have and continue to expect to incur additional significant legal, accounting, and other expenses in connection with operating as a public company. If our revenue does not increase to offset these increases in our operating expenses, our operating results and financial condition may be harmed. 
    
  Our business is affected by seasonality. 
    
  Our revenue and operating results are affected by general seasonal spending trends associated with holidays. For example, our fourth quarter has typically been our strongest quarter in terms of revenue and operating income, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season. We generated approximately 38%, 50%, and 40% of our full year revenue during the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Accordingly, any shortfall in expected fourth quarter revenue would adversely affect our annual operating results. Furthermore, our rapid growth in recent years may obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our business and may continue to affect our business. Accordingly, yearly or quarterly comparisons of our  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

operating results may not be useful and our results in any particular period will not necessarily be indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Seasonality in our business can also be impacted by introductions of new or enhanced products and services, including the costs associated with such introductions. 
    
  Any material disruption of our information technology systems, or those of third-party partners and data center providers could materially damage user and business partner relationships, and subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. 
    
  We depend on our information technology systems, as well as those of third parties, to develop new products and services, operate our website, host and manage our services, store data, process transactions, respond to user inquiries, and manage inventory and our supply chain. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems or those of third parties whom we depend upon, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our failure to successfully manage significant increases in user volume or successfully upgrade our or their systems, system failures, or other causes, could cause outages or delays in our services, which could harm our brand and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, such disruption could cause information, including data related to orders, to be lost or delayed which could especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during the holiday season result in delays in the delivery of products to stores and users or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our merchandise, harm our brand and reputation, and cause our revenue to decline. Problems with our third-party data center service providers, the telecommunications network providers with whom they contract, or with the systems by which telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their users could adversely affect the experience of our users. Our third-party data center service providers could decide to close their facilities or cease providing us services without adequate notice. Any changes in third-party service levels at our data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with our platform could harm our brand and may damage the data of our users. If changes in technology cause our information systems, or those of third parties whom we depend upon, to become obsolete, or if our or their information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose users and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. 
    
  We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and any security breaches or our actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal obligations could harm our business. 
    
  We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. Our users  health and fitness-related data and other highly personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, and biometric information such as heart rates, sleeping patterns, GPS-based location, and activity patterns. Due to the volume and sensitivity of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products, the security features of our platform and information systems are critical. If our security measures, some of which are managed by third parties, are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to or acquire sensitive user data. If we or our third-party service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with which our users choose to share their Fitbit data were to experience a breach of systems compromising our users  sensitive data, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of our user data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. Such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data. Our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access. Additionally, if third-party service providers that host user data on our behalf experience security breaches or violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such events may also put our users  information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. While we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the event we experience a security breach. 
    
  Our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand. If events occur that damage our brand, our business and financial results may be harmed. 
    
  Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value of the  Fitbit  brand. The  Fitbit  name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high quality products and services, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the  Fitbit  mark and other  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

trademarks important to our brand. Our brand could be harmed if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or brand were to be tarnished by negative publicity. For example, there has been media coverage of some of the users of our products reporting skin irritation, as well as personal injury lawsuits filed against us relating to the Fitbit Zip, Fitbit One, Fitbit Flex, Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fitbit Surge products. We also believe that our reputation and brand may be harmed if we fail to maintain a consistently high level of customer service. In addition, we believe the popularity of the  Fitbit  brand makes it a target for counterfeiting or imitation, with third parties attempting to sell counterfeit products that attempt to replicate our products.  
    
  In addition, our products may be diverted from our authorized retailers and distributors and sold on the  gray market.  Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our channel partners compete with often heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in user satisfaction issues, which may have a negative impact on our brand. When products are purchased outside our authorized retailers and distributors, there is a risk that our customers are buying substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled, or damaged, or used products represented as new. 
    
   Any occurrence of counterfeiting, imitation, or confusion with our brand could adversely affect our reputation, place negative pricing pressure on our products, reduce sales of our products, and impair the value of our brand. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments, and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to successfully maintain, promote, and position our brand and protect our reputation or if we incur significant expenses in this effort, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. 
    
  Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations. 
    
  The threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our servers, computer systems, and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber attacks such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, unauthorized access to user data, and loss of consumer confidence. In addition, we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire sensitive information or company assets. Despite our efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we may not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. Any cyber attack that attempts to obtain our or our users  data and assets, disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, be expensive to remedy, and damage our reputation. In addition, any such breaches may result in negative publicity, adversely affect our brand, decrease demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
    
  We spend significant amounts on advertising and other marketing campaigns to acquire new users, which may not be successful or cost-effective. 
    
  We spend significant amounts on advertising and other marketing campaigns, such as television, cinema, print advertising, and social media, as well as increased promotional activities, to acquire new users and we expect our marketing expenses to increase in the future as we continue to spend significant amounts to acquire new users and increase awareness of our products and services. In 2015 and the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , advertising expenses were $237.0 million and $183.8 million, respectively, representing approximately 13% and 12% of our revenue for each period, respectively. While we seek to structure our advertising campaigns in the manner that we believe is most likely to encourage people to use our products and services, we may fail to identify advertising opportunities that satisfy our anticipated return on advertising spend as we scale our investments in marketing, accurately predict user acquisition, or fully understand or estimate the conditions and behaviors that drive user behavior. If for any reason any of our advertising campaigns prove less successful than anticipated in attracting new users, we may not be able to recover our advertising spend, and our rate of user acquisition may fail to meet market expectations, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that our advertising and other marketing efforts will result in increased sales of our products and services. 
    
  We depend on retailers and distributors to sell and market our products, and our failure to maintain and further develop our sales channels could harm our business. 
    
  We primarily sell our products through retailers and distributors and depend on these third-parties to sell and market our products to consumers. Any changes to our current mix of retailers and distributors could adversely affect our gross margin and could negatively affect both our brand image and our reputation. Our sales depend, in part, on retailers adequately displaying our products, including providing attractive space and POP displays in their stores, and training their sales personnel to sell our products.  
  
   47 

     Table of Contents  

If our retailers and distributors are not successful in selling our products or overestimate demand for our products, our revenue would decrease and we could experience lower gross margins due to product returns or price protection claims. Our retailers also often offer products and services of our competitors in their stores. Furthermore, our business could be adversely affected if any of our large retailers were to experience financial difficulties or store closures, or change the focus of their businesses in a way that deemphasized the sale of our products. In addition, our success in expanding and entering into new markets internationally will depend on our ability to establish relationships with new retailers and distributors. We also sell and will need to continue to expand our sales through online retailers, such as Amazon.com, as consumers increasingly make purchases online. If we do not maintain our relationship with existing retailers and distributors or develop relationships with new retailers and distributors our ability to sell our products and services could be adversely affected and our business may be harmed. 
    
  In 2015 and for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , our five largest retailers and distributors accounted for approximately 55% and 54% of our revenue, respectively. Of these retailers and distributors, Wynit Distribution, Best Buy, and Amazon.com accounted for approximately 15%, 14%, and 14% of our revenue for 2015, respectively, and approximately 15%, 12%, and 14% of our revenue for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively. Accordingly, the loss of a small number of our large retailers and distributors, or the reduction in business with one or more of these retailers and distributors, could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results. While we have agreements with these large retailers and distributors, these agreements do not require them to purchase any meaningful amount of our products. 
    
  Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products. 
    
  The wearable, fitness, and electronics retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our connected health and fitness devices, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales. Any reduction in sales by our retailers would adversely affect our revenue, operating results, and financial condition. 
    
  The insolvency, credit problems, or other financial difficulties confronting our retailers and distributors could expose us to financial risk. 
    
  Some of our retailers and distributors have experienced and may continue to experience financial difficulties. The insolvency, credit problems, or other financial difficulties confronting our retailers and distributors could expose us to financial risk. In addition, if the credit capacity of any retailers or distributors and accounts receivable balances increase, we may be subject to additional financial risk. Financial difficulties of our retailers and distributors could impede their effectiveness and also expose us to risks if they are unable to pay for the products they purchase from us. The difficulties of retailers and distributors may also lead to price cuts of our products and adverse effects on our brand and operating results. Any reduction in sales by our current retailers or distributors, loss of large resellers or distributors, or decrease in revenue from our retailers or distributors could adversely affect our revenue, operating results, and financial condition. 
    
  If we continue to grow, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of our business, which could negatively impact our brand and financial performance. 
    
  We were founded in 2007 and have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception. Our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number of employees increasing from 469 as of December 31, 2014 to 1,101 as of December 31, 2015 to 1,627 as of   October 1, 2016  , and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. If our operations continue to grow, we may experience difficulties in obtaining components for our products in quantities sufficient to meet market demand, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with third-party sourcing and manufacturing. We could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development, and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space for our expanding workforce. This expansion could increase the strain on our resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training, and managing an increasing number of employees. If we do not adapt to meet these evolving challenges, and if the current and future members of our management team do not effectively scale with our growth, we may experience erosion to our brand, the quality of our products and services may suffer, and our corporate culture may be harmed.

Because we have only a limited history operating our business at its current scale, it is difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. Our limited operating experience at this scale, combined with the rapidly evolving nature of the market in which we sell our products and services, substantial uncertainty concerning how these markets may develop, and other economic factors beyond our control, reduces our ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenue. As such, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more developed and predictable market. Failure to manage our future growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 
    
  Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees, including our founders, James Park and Eric N. Friedman, and on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and senior management. 
    
  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent on the contributions of our co-founders, James Park and Eric N. Friedman, as well as other members of our management team. The loss of any key personnel could make it more difficult to manage our operations and research and development activities, reduce our employee retention and revenue, and impair our ability to compete. Although we have generally entered into employment offer letters with our key personnel, these agreements have no specific duration and provide for at-will employment, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time. 
    
  Competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we are located, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We may not be successful in attracting, integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. Fluctuations in the price of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult or costly to use equity awards to motivate, incentivize and retain our employees. If the perceived value of our equity or equity awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled employees. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that the number of shares reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans will be sufficient to grant equity awards adequate to recruit new employees and to compensate existing employees. Additionally, we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company gives them a substantial amount of personal wealth. Likewise, we have a number of current employees whose equity awards are fully vested and are entitled to receive substantial amounts of our capital stock. As a result, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate these employees, and this wealth could affect their decisions about whether or not they continue to work for us. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. 
    
  Our failure to comply with U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security, and data protection, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, which covers the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and our brand. 
    
  We are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection, and data security. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. 
    
  In particular, there are numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other user data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy, data security, and data protection. However, given that the scope, interpretation, and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be conflicting, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with our privacy or security policies or privacy-related legal obligations by us or third-party service-providers or the failure or perceived failure by third-party apps, with which our users choose to share their Fitbit data, to comply with their privacy policies or privacy-related legal obligations as they relate to the Fitbit data shared with them, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or negative publicity, and could have an adverse effect on our brand and operating results. 
    
  Beginning on August 1, 2016, U.S. companies could self-certify to the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield, which is a new framework developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission to address transatlantic data flows. As of November 3, 2016, our self-certification was approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce and our certification is available on the Privacy Shield website. This Privacy Shield Framework supersedes the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents  

Framework as developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which has historically provided a method for U.S. companies operating within the European Union to transfer personal data from citizens of E.U. member countries to the United States in a way that is consistent with the E.U. Data Protection Directive. The U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Framework was invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in October 2015. We remain certified under the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, as it is currently an available mechanism to transfer Swiss data to the United States. If we fail to meet the principles under Privacy Shield or U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor, or if any of these Frameworks are later invalidated by the European courts or otherwise become defunct, national data protection authorities in the European Union or the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, could bring enforcement actions seeking to prohibit or suspend our data transfers to the United States, or against us for being misleading or deceptive, and we could also face additional legal liability, fines, negative publicity, and resulting loss of business. 
    
  Certain health-related laws and regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, may have an impact on our business. For example, in September 2015 we announced that we intend to offer HIPAA compliant capabilities to certain customers of our corporate wellness offerings who are  covered entities  under HIPAA, which may include our execution of Business Associate Agreements with such covered entities. In addition, changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in the user data we collect being deemed protected health information, or PHI, under HIPAA and HITECH. If we are unable to comply with the applicable privacy and security requirements under HIPAA and HITECH, or we fail to comply with Business Associate Agreements that we enter into with covered entities, we could be subject to claims, legal liabilities, penalties, fines, and negative publicity, which could harm our operating results. 
    
  Governments are continuing to focus on privacy and data security and it is possible that new privacy or data security laws will be passed or existing laws will be amended in a way that is material to our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding our users  data could require us to modify our services and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services, and features. Although we have made efforts to design our policies, procedures, and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal, and foreign laws, changes to applicable laws and regulations in this area could subject us to additional regulation and oversight, any of which could significantly increase our operating costs. 
    
  Our business and products are subject to a variety of additional U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are central to our business; our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business or our operating results. 
    
  We are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations regarding consumer protection, advertising, electronic commerce, intellectual property, manufacturing, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions.   
    
  The labeling, distribution, importation, marketing, and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various U.S. state and federal and foreign agencies, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, FTC, Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, Federal Communications Commission, and state attorneys general, as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local, and international regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products and services are distributed or sold. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could become subject to enforcement actions or the imposition of significant monetary fines, other penalties, or claims, which could harm our operating results or our ability to conduct our business. 
    
  The global nature of our business operations also create various domestic and foreign regulatory challenges and subject us to laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions, and our products are also subject to U.S. export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. If we become liable under these laws or regulations, we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain products or services, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, and legislative proposals could harm our brand or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of compliance or other liabilities under these laws or regulations could harm our business and operating results. 
    
  Our international operations subject us to additional costs and risks, and our continued expansion internationally may not be successful.

     Table of Contents  

We have entered into many international markets in a relatively short time and may enter into additional markets in the future. Outside of the United States, we currently have operations in Australia and a number of countries in Asia and Europe. There are significant costs and risks inherent in conducting business in international markets, including: 

establishing and maintaining effective controls at foreign locations and the associated increased costs; 
                
    adapting our technologies, products, and services to non-U.S. consumers  preferences and customs; 
                
    variations in margins by geography; 
                
    increased competition from local providers of similar products; 
                
    longer sales or collection cycles in some countries; 
                
    compliance with foreign laws and regulations; 
                
    compliance with the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business, potential double taxation of our international earnings, and potentially adverse tax consequences due to U.S. and foreign tax laws as they relate to our international operations; 
                
    compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, by us, our employees, and our business partners; 
                
    complexity and other risks associated with current and future foreign legal requirements, including legal requirements related to consumer protection, consumer product safety, and data privacy frameworks, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, and applicable privacy and data protection laws in foreign jurisdictions where we currently conduct business or intend to conduct business in the future; 
                
    currency exchange rate fluctuations and related effects on our operating results; 
                
    economic and political instability in some countries, particularly those in China where we have expanded; 
                
    the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing rights abroad;  
                
    tariffs and customs duties and the classification of our products by applicable governmental bodies; and 
                
    other costs of doing business internationally. 
       
  Our products are manufactured overseas and imported into the United States, the European Union, and other countries and may be subject to duties, tariffs and anti-dumping penalties imposed by applicable customs authorities. Those duties and tariffs are based on the classification of each of our products and is routinely subject to review by the applicable customs authorities. We are unable to predict whether those authorities will agree with our classifications and if those authorities do not agree with our classifications additional duties, tariffs or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products. Such actions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might adversely affect our sales and profitability. 
    
  These factors and other factors could harm our international operations and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, we may incur significant operating expenses as a result of our international expansion, and it may not be successful. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in new markets. We may also encounter difficulty expanding into new international markets because of limited brand recognition in certain parts of the world, leading to delayed acceptance of our products and services by users in these new international markets. If we are unable to continue to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. 
    
  To date, we have derived substantially all of our revenue from sales of our connected health and fitness devices, and sales of our subscription-based premium services have historically accounted for less than 1% of our revenue. 
    
  To date, substantially all of our revenue has been derived from sales of our connected health and fitness devices, and we expect to continue to derive the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of these devices for the foreseeable future. In each of the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  , we derived less than 1% of our revenue from sales of our subscription-based premium services. However, in the future we expect to increase sales of subscriptions to these services. Our inability to successfully sell and market our premium services could deprive us of a potentially significant source of revenue in the future. In addition, sales of our premium services may lead to additional sales of our connected health and fitness devices and user engagement with our platform. As a result, our future growth and financial performance may depend, in part, on our ability to sell more subscriptions to our premium services. 
    
  We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries. 

51 

     Table of Contents  

We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, including potential class actions, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger, our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. 
    
  The outcome and impact of such claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to judgment calls. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could harm our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, or orders preventing us from offering certain products, or services, or requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could harm our business. 
    
  There have been reports that some users of the Fitbit Flex, Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fitbit Surge have experienced skin irritations, which could result in additional negative publicity or otherwise harm our business. In addition, some of our users have filed personal injury lawsuits against us relating to the Fitbit Zip, Fitbit One, Fitbit Flex, Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fitbit Surge products, which could divert management s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees and other costs. 
    
  Due to the nature of some of our wearable devices, some users have had in the past and may in the future experience skin irritations or other biocompatibility issues not uncommon with jewelry or other wearable products that stay in contact with skin for extended periods of time. There have been reports of some users of Fitbit Flex, Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fitbit Surge experiencing skin irritations. This negative publicity could harm sales of our products and also adversely affect our relationships with retailers that sell our products, including causing them to be reluctant to continue to sell our products. In addition, some of our users have filed personal injury lawsuits against us relating to the Fitbit Zip, Fitbit One, Fitbit Flex, Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fitbit Surge products. While we do not believe that these lawsuits are material, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any proceedings arising from such claims, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may result in the diversion of our management s time and attention from other aspects of our business and may cause us to incur substantial litigation or settlement costs. If large numbers of users experience these problems, we could be subject to enforcement actions or the imposition of significant monetary fines, other penalties, or proceedings by the CPSC or other U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies and face additional personal injury or class action litigation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
    
  We may be subject to CPSC recalls, regulatory proceedings and litigation in various jurisdictions, including multi-jurisdiction federal and state class action and personal injury claims, which may require significant management attention and disrupt our business operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and our brand. 
    
  We face product liability, product safety and product compliance risks relating to the sale, use and performance of our products. The products we sell must be designed and manufactured to be safe for their intended purposes. Certain of our products must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations. For example, some of our products are subject to the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which empower the CPSC. The CPSC is empowered to take action against hazards presented by consumer products, up to and including product recalls. We are required to report certain incidents related to the safety and compliance of our products to the CPSC, and failure to do so could result in a civil penalty.  
    
  Our products may, from time to time, be subject to recall for product safety and compliance reasons. For example, in March 2014, we recalled one of our products, the Fitbit Force, after some of our users experienced allergic reactions to adhesives in the wristband. These reactions included skin irritation, rashes, and blistering. The recall had a negative impact on our operating results, primarily in our fourth quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014, and the fourth quarter of 2015. See the section titled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Fitbit Force Product Recall  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the financial impact of the recall on our historical operating results. We have provided and are continuing to provide full refunds to consumers who return the Fitbit Force. If returns of the Fitbit Force or other costs related to the recall are higher than anticipated, we will be required to increase our reserves related to the recall which would negatively impact our operating results in the future. 

52 

     Table of Contents  

The recall is being conducted in conjunction with the CPSC, which has been monitoring recall effectiveness and compliance. In addition to the financial impacts discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, this recall requires us to collect a significant amount of information for the CPSC, which takes significant time and internal and external resources. 
    
  A large number of lawsuits, including multi-jurisdiction complex federal and state class action and personal injury claims, were filed against us relating to the Fitbit Force. These litigation matters have required significant attention of our management and resources and disrupted the ordinary course of our business operations. We have settled all of the class action lawsuits, and the settlement of a number of personal injury claims is almost final. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we received proceeds from the insurance policies that apply to these claims and related legal fees, and we recorded an accrual for liabilities arising under these claims that was immaterial and falls within the amount of the insurance proceeds received. 
    
  In addition, the CPSC conducted an investigation into several of our products. Although the CPSC has not found a substantial product hazard, there can be no assurances that investigations will not be conducted or that product hazards or other defects will not be found in the future with respect to our products. The Fitbit Force product recall, regulatory proceedings, and litigation have had and may continue to have, and any future recalls, regulatory proceedings, and litigation could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results, and brand. Furthermore, because of the global nature of our product sales, in the event we experience defects with respect to products sold outside the United States, we could become subject to recalls, regulatory proceedings, and litigation by foreign governmental agencies and private litigants, which could significantly increase the costs of managing any product issues. Any ongoing and future regulatory proceedings or litigation, regardless of their merits, could further divert management s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees and other costs. 
    
  Our financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. 
    
  Our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads us to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for our products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, we may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to our foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause us to reduce international pricing, incur losses on our foreign currency derivative instruments, and incur increased operating expenses, thereby limiting any benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase our cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. 
    
  We use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. In addition, our counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We seek to mitigate this risk by limiting counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions.  
    
  Changes in legislation in U.S. and foreign taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies, as well as the application of such laws, could materially impact our financial position and operating results. 
    
  Recent or future changes to the U.S. and other foreign tax laws could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. We generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries, branches, or representative offices and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations are based on our corporate operating structure, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property, scope of our international operations, and intercompany arrangements with and amongst the subsidiaries within the company group. Our direct and indirect subsidiaries are subject to complex transfer pricing tax regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may adversely impact various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in various countries in which we operate. Any changes in the tax laws applicable to our international business activities, including the laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions, may increase our worldwide effective tax rate, and may adversely affect our financial position, and operating results. 
    
  In addition, our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, principles, and interpretations, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. As we operate in numerous taxing  
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. 
    
  We are subject to review and audit by U.S. and other tax authorities. If any tax authority disagrees with any position we have taken, our tax liabilities and operating results may be adversely affected. 

If we are unable to protect our domain names, our brand, business, and operating results could be adversely affected. 
    
  We have registered domain names for websites, or URLs, that we use in our business, such as Fitbit.com. If we are unable to maintain our rights in these domain names, our competitors or other third parties could capitalize on our brand recognition by using these domain names for their own benefit. In addition, although we own the  Fitbit  domain name under various global top level domains such as .com and .net, as well as under various country-specific domains, we might not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire or maintain other country-specific versions of the  Fitbit  domain name or other potentially similar URLs. The regulation of domain names in the United States and elsewhere is generally conducted by Internet regulatory bodies and is subject to change. If we lose the ability to use a domain name in a particular country, we may be forced to either incur significant additional expenses to market our solutions within that country, including the development of a new brand and the creation of new promotional materials, or elect not to sell our solutions in that country. Either result could substantially harm our business and operating results. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain the domain names that utilize the name  Fitbit  in all of the countries in which we currently conduct or intend to conduct business. Further, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights varies among jurisdictions and is unclear in some jurisdictions. Domain names similar to ours have already been registered in the United States and elsewhere, and we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of, our brand or our trademarks. Protecting and enforcing our rights in our domain names and determining the rights of others may require litigation, which could result in substantial costs, divert management attention, and not be decided favorably to us. 
    
  Our use of  open source  software could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation. 
    
  A portion of the technologies we use incorporates  open source  software, and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. These licenses may subject us to certain unfavorable conditions, including requirements that we offer our products and services that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make publicly available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating, or using the open source software, or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such provider, we could be required to disclose or provide at no cost any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of such licensed software. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software that we use or license were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the applicable license, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages and enjoined from the sale of our products and services that contained the open source software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt the distribution and sale of our products and services and harm our business. 
    
  We may engage in merger and acquisition activities, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results. 
    
  As part of our business strategy, we may make investments in other companies, products, or technologies. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users or investors. In addition, if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected.  
    
  Acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management from their primary responsibilities, subject us to additional liabilities, increase our expenses, and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or  
  
   54 

     Table of Contents  

other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Additionally, we may receive indications of interest from other parties interested in acquiring some or all of our business. The time required to evaluate such indications of interest could require significant attention from management, disrupt the ordinary functioning of our business, and adversely affect our operating results. 

The Aria Wi-Fi connected scale is subject to FDA regulation, and sales of this product or future regulated products could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements. 
    
  The Aria scale is regulated as a medical device by the FDA and corresponding state regulatory agencies, and we may have future products that are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. The medical device industry in the United States is regulated by governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state regulatory agencies. Before we can market or sell a new regulated product or make a significant modification to an existing medical device in the United States, we must obtain regulatory clearance or approval from the FDA, unless an exemption from pre-market review applies. We received a pre-market clearance for the Aria scale in June 2014. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all, for future products. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for any medical device products under development could prevent us from generating revenue from these products. Medical devices, including the Aria scale, are also subject to numerous ongoing compliance requirements under the regulations of the FDA and corresponding state regulatory agencies, which can be costly and time consuming. For example, under FDA regulations medical device manufacturers are required to, among other things, (i) establish a quality system to help ensure that their products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications, (ii) establish and maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints, (iii) establish and maintain a corrective and preventive action procedure, (iv) report certain device-related adverse events and product problems to the FDA, and (v) report to the FDA the removal or correction of a distributed product. If we experience any product problems requiring reporting to the FDA or if we otherwise fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations or the regulations of corresponding state regulatory agencies, with respect to the Aria scale or future regulated products, we could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and could be subject to enforcement actions such as fines, civil penalties, injunctions, recalls of products, delays in the introduction of products into the market, and refusal of the FDA or other regulators to grant future clearances or approvals, which could harm our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition. 
    
  If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. 
    
  We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. 
    
  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We will be required to make a formal assessment and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. 
    
  Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would  
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
    
  Pursuant to Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will be required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness, provide a management report and be subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm of our internal control over financial reporting, beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. 
    
  Our management team has limited experience managing a public company. 
    
  Most members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. We are subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
    
  Our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism. 
    
  Our business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins, and similar events. The third-party systems and operations and contract manufacturers we rely on, such as the data centers we lease, are subject to similar risks. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our corporate offices and one of our data center facilities are located in California, a state that frequently experiences earthquakes. In addition, the facilities at which our contract manufacturers manufacture our products are located in parts of Asia that frequently endure typhoons and earthquakes. Acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could also cause disruptions in our or our suppliers , contract manufacturers , and logistics providers  businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting California or other locations where we have data centers or store significant inventory of our products. As we rely heavily on our data center facilities, computer and communications systems, and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, these disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt suppliers  businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
    
  If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, inventories, product warranty reserves, the Fitbit Force recall, accounting for derivative financial instruments, business combinations, accounting for income taxes, and stock-based compensation expense. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. 
    
  Our revolving credit facility provides our lenders with first-priority liens against substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property, and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, which could limit our operational flexibility and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. 
    
  In December 2015, we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility and revolving credit and guarantee agreement into one senior credit facility. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to, among other things: 

56 

     Table of Contents  

use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks, and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions; 
                
    incur additional indebtedness; 
                
    sell certain assets; 
                
    guarantee certain obligations of third parties; 
                
    declare dividends or make certain distributions; and 
                
    undergo a merger or consolidation or other transactions. 
       
  Our credit agreement also prohibits us from exceeding a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity reserve. Our ability to comply with these and other covenants is dependent upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
    
  Our failure to comply with the covenants or payment requirements, or the occurrence of other events specified in our credit agreement, could result in an event of default under the credit agreement, which would give our lenders the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under the credit agreement and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, we have granted our lenders first-priority liens against all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property, as collateral. Failure to comply with the covenants or other restrictions in the credit agreement could result in a default. If the debt under our credit agreement was to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay it, which would have an immediate adverse effect on our business and operating results. This could potentially cause us to cease operations and result in a complete loss of your investment in our Class A common stock.  
    
  We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments. 
    
  Credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk, changes in interest rates, or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although we have not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
    
  Regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. 
    
  We are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which will require us to conduct due diligence on and disclose whether or not our products contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such due diligence activities. It is also possible that we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to alter our products, processes, or sources of supply to avoid such materials. 
    
  Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock 
    
  The market price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
    
  The market price of our Class A common stock has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our IPO in June 2015 at a price of $20.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $11.65 to $51.90 through October 31, 2016. In addition, the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile. 
    
  The market price of our Class A common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 

overall performance of the equity markets; 
                
    actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results; 
                
    changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections; 
     
   57 

     Table of Contents  

failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; 
                
    recruitment or departure of key personnel; 
                
    the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry; 
                
    negative publicity related to problems in our manufacturing or the real or perceived quality of our products, as well as the failure to timely launch new products that gain market acceptance; 
                
    rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; 
                
    announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; 
                
    new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; 
                
    lawsuits threatened or filed against us; 
                
    other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events; and 
                
    sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders. 
       
  In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation, which is described in Note 6,  Commitments and Contingencies  in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. This or any future securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business. 
    
  Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. 
    
  Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , there were 223.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding, and all shares of our common stock are available for sale in the public market, subject in certain cases to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, various vesting agreements, and our insider trading policy. 
    
  In addition, as of   October 1, 2016  , we had stock options outstanding that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of 1.2 million shares of Class A common stock and 34.6 million shares of Class B common stock (which shares of Class B common stock generally convert to Class A common stock upon their sale or transfer). We also had restricted stock units, or RSUs, outstanding as of   October 1, 2016   that may be settled for 10.4 million shares of Class A common stock and 0.3 million shares of Class B common stock. All of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options or settlement of RSUs, and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, are registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares may be freely sold in the public market upon issuance subject to applicable vesting requirements. 
    
  In addition, certain holders of our capital stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of their shares or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders. 
    
  The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with holders of our Class B common stock, including our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. 
    
  Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of   October 1, 2016  , our directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective affiliates, held a substantial majority of the voting power of our capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the earlier of June 17, 2027 or the date the holders of a majority of our Class B common stock choose to convert their shares. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. 

58 

     Table of Contents  

Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term.  
    
  If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline. 
    
  The trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline. 
    
  We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 
    
  We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. In addition, our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. 
    
  Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, limit our stockholders  ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, and limit the market price of our common stock. 
    
  Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws include provisions that: 

provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms at such time as the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock; 
                
    permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships; 
                
    require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws; 
                
    authorize the issuance of  blank check  preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; 
                
    provide that only the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; 
                
    provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets; 
                
    prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; 
                
    provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws; and 
                
    establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. 
       
  In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.
