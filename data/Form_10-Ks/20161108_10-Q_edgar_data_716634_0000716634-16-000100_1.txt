NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (Unaudited) 

Note 1     The Company and   Basis of Presentation 

Reading International, Inc., a Nevada corporation ( RDI  and collectively with our consolidated subsidiaries and corporate predecessors, the  Company,   Reading  and  we,   us,  or  our ), was   incorporated in 1999, and, following the consummation of a consolidation transaction on December 31, 2001, is now the owner of the consolidated businesses and assets of Reading Entertainment, Inc. ( RDGE ), Craig Corporation ( CRG ) and Citadel Holding Corporation ( CDL )  .  Our businesses consist primarily of: 

the development, ownership, and operation of multiplex cinemas in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand; and  ,     

the development, ownership, and operation of retail and commercial real estate in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.     

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto. Significant estimates include projections we make regarding the recoverability of our assets, valuations of our interest   rate   swaps and the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company controls, and should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year-ended December 31, 2015.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  These   were prepared in accordance with   the   U.S.   GAAP   for interim reporting with the instructions   for   Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  As such, they do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. We believe that we have included all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period. Operating results for the   quarter and   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for t  he year ending December 31, 2016  .   

Reclassifications 

C  ertain   reclassifications have been made in the 2015 comparative information in the consolidated balance sheet  s   and notes to conform to the 2016 presentation.  These changes relate to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03 as discussed more fully   below  .  These reclassifications had no significant impact on our 2015 financial position, results of operations and cash flows as previously reported. 

Recently   Adopted   and   Issued   Accounting Pronouncements  

Adopted:  

On January 1, 201  6  , the Company   adopted   ASU 2015-03  , Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ,   issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (     FASB     ).   This new standard, which became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, required that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums  .   The   impact of this   adoption   included   reclassification of the deferred financing costs (net of amortization) from  Other Assets    to a reduction in the   associated Debt account  .   

Also, on January 1, 2016, the Company adopted   ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  .  Under this new standard, an acquirer in a business combination transaction must recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation or amortization, or other income effects, if any,   because   of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date, must be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined rather than retrospectively.  The ASU also requires that the acquirer present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  The adoption of this standard   had an   impact   on     the finalization of the purchase price allocation of Cannon Park   acquired in December 2015  ,    which was completed during this current   third quarter of 2016  .        Please r  efer to Note 5   Property   Equipment for the Cannon Park acquisition discussion.

Issued: 

I  n    August    2  016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  The amendments covered in this ASU are improvements to current GAAP, as it will provide guidance to eight (8) specific cash flow classification issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice  .  The new standard becomes effective fo  r the Company on January 1, 2018  .  Early adoption is permissible.  The Company does not antici  pate the adoption of ASU 2016-15   to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In   March   2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-09  ,    Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .     This new guidance provides simplifications involving several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences (  such as   excess tax benefits recorded in income tax expense/benefit, rather than additional paid-in capital), classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for   the Company on     January     1, 2017  .  Early adoption is permitted.  An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In addition  , in   March   2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-07  ,    Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  .  This new guidance effectively removes the retroactive application imposed in current guidance when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence.  The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting.  The new standard becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2017.  Early adoption is permissible.    The Company does not ant  icipate the adoption of ASU 2016  -  07   to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  . 

In February 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-02  ,    Lea  ses (Topic 842)  .    This new guidance   establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The new standard   becomes   effective for   the Company on     January 1, 2019  .      A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently assessing the impact of   this new guidance   on the   consolidated   financial statements and related disclosures. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued   ASU 2014-09  ,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ,   to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S.  ,   resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under U.S. GAAP.  Under the new model, recognition of revenues occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.    Subsequently,   in March 2016,   FASB issued ASU 2016-08 to provide guidance on principal versus agent considerations.    The new standard becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted but cannot be earlier than January 1, 2017. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application.  We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated condensed financial statements.  While we believe the proposed guidance will not have   a    m  aterial impact on our business because   our revenue predominantly comes from movie ticket sales and concession purchases, we plan to   complete   the analysis to ensure that we are in compliance prior to the effective date.

Note   2     Business Segments 

R  eported below are the   operating   segments of the Company for which separate financial information is available and for which segment results are evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive Officer  , the chief operating decision-maker of the Compa  n  y  .    As part of our   real estate activities, w  e have   acquired, and continue to hold   raw land in urban and suburban centers in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.  

The tables below summarize the results of ope  rations for each of our   business segments   for the   quarter     and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Operating expense includes costs associated with the day-to-day operations of the cinemas and the management of rental properties, including our live theater assets  . 

A reconciliation of segment operating income to income before income taxes is as follows:  

Note 3   Operations in Foreign Currency 

We have significant assets in Australia and New Zealand. To the extent possible, we conduct our Australian and New Zealand operations (collectively  foreign operations ) on a self-funding basis where we use cash flows generated by our foreign operations to pay for the expense of foreign operations.  Our Australian and New Zealand assets and liabilities are translated from their functional currencies of Australian dollar ( AU$ ) and New Zealand dollar ( NZ$ ), respectively, to   the   U.S. dollar based on the exchange rate as of   September 30, 2016  . The carrying value of the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations fluctuates as a result of changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of the foreign operations and the U.S. dollar. The translation adjustments are accumulated in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

Because we intend to conduct business mostly on a self-funding basis (except for funds used to pay an appropriate share of our U.S. corporate overhead), we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exposure. 

9   

Presented in the table below are the currency exchange rates for Australia and New Zealand as of and for the period-ended   September 30, 2016  ,    December 31, 2015 and   September 30, 2015:           

Note   4     Earnings Per Share 

Basic   earnings per share ( EPS )   is   calculated   by dividing the net income attributable to   the Company s   common   stockholders   by the weighted average number of common   shares     outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is   calculated   by dividing the net income attributable to   the Company s   common   stockholders   by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period   and are calculated   using the treasury stock method for equity-based compensation awards  .   

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted   EPS   and a reconciliation of the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding  : 

Note 5   Property and Equipment 

Operating Property, net 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , property associated with our operating activities is summarized as follows: 

10   

Depreciation expense for operating property   was   $4.0   million and   $11.2   million for the quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and     $3.3   million and   $10.1   million for the quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

New Corporate Headquarters in Los Angeles 

On April 11, 2016, we purchased a   24,000   square foot Class B office building with   72   parking spaces located at 5995 Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City, California   (a Los Angeles suburb)   for   $11.2   million.  We intend to use approximately   50%   of the leasable area for our headquarters offices and to lease the remainder to unaffiliated third parties.  We anticipate, when the move is completed at the end of 2016   or early 2017   and the excess space is leased, that we will be able to reduce our headquarters occupancy cost by approximately   $350,000   per annum.  

Burwood, Australia 

On May 12, 2014, we entered into a contract to sell our undeveloped   50.6   acre parcel in Burwood, Victoria, Australia, to Australand Holdings Limited (now known as Frasers Property Australia) for a purchase price of   $50.8   million (  AU$65.0   million).  We received   $5.9   million (  AU$6.5   million) on May 23, 2014.  The remaining purchase price of   $44.9   million (  AU$58.5   million) is due on December 31, 2017.     Refer to   Note 18   Subsequent Events   for further information. 

Our book value in the property is   $40.0   million (  AU$52.1   million) and   $38.0    (  AU$52.1   million) as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively   (the difference being attributable solely to currency fluctuations)  .  While the transaction was treated as a sale for tax purposes in 2014, it does not qualify as a sale under US GAAP until the receipt of the payment of the balance of the purchase price due on December 31, 2017 (or earlier depending upon whether any prepay  ment obligation is triggered).  The asset is classified as long-term land held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Doheny Condo, Los Angeles  

On February 25, 2015, we sold our Los Angeles Condo for   $3.0   million resulting in a   $2.8   million gain on sale. 

Taupo, New Zealand 

On April 1, 2015, we entered into   two   definitive purchase and sale agreements to sell our properties at Taupo, New Zealand for a combined sales price of   $2.  4   million (NZ  $3.4   million).  The first agreement related to a property with a sales price of   $1.6   million (NZ  $2.2   million) and a book value of   $1.3   million (NZ  $1.8   million), which closed on April 30, 2015 when we received the sales price in full. The other agreement related to a property with a sales price of   $831,000    (  NZ$1.2   million) and a book value of   $426,000   (NZ  $615,000  ) which was completed and for which we received cash settlement representing   the   full sales price on March 31, 2016.  The first transaction qualified as a sale under both U.S. GAAP and tax purposes during the year-ended December 31, 2015.  The second transaction was recorded as a sale during the three months ended March 31, 2016. 

Moonee Ponds, Australia 

On October 15, 2013, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to sell this property for a sales price of   $17.5   million (  AU$23.0   million) payable in full upon closing of the transaction on April 16, 2015.  In accordance with the requirements under U.S. GAAP, we recognized a gain on sale of   $8.0   million (  AU$10.3   million) in the prior-year   second   quarter upon the receipt of sale proceeds on April 16, 2015. 

Cannon Park, Queensland, Australia 

On December 23, 2015, we completed a   100%   acquisition of   two   adjoining entertainment-themed centers ( ETCs ) in Townsville, Australia for a total of   $24.  1   million (  AU$33.4   million) in cash. The properties are located approximately 6 miles from downtown Townsville, the second largest city in Queensland, Australia. The total gross leasable area of the two adjoining properties, the Cannon Park City Centre and the Cannon Park Discount Centre, is   133,000   square feet. The Cannon Park City Centre is anchored by Reading Cinemas, which is operated by Reading International s   75%   owned subsidiary, Australia Country Cinemas, and has   three   mini-major tenants and   ten   specialty family oriented restaurant tenants. The Cannon Park Discount Centre is anchored by Kingpin Bowling and supported by   four   other retailers. This acquisition is consistent with our business plan to own, where practical, the land underlying our entertainment assets. 

The acquired assets consist primarily of the land and buildings, which  , at the time of acquisition,     wa  s approximately   98%   leased to existing tenants. Tenancies range  d   from having   9   months to   8   years left to run on their leases at the time of purchase.  

11   

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company finalized the allocation of the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on its estimates of their fair values on the acquisition date  .    The acquired value components of this real estate acquisition included both tangible and intangible assets.    The determination of the fair values of the acquired assets   and assumed liabilities   (and the related determination of estimated lives   of depreciable tangible and identifiable intangible assets  ) requires significant judgment.    The estimates and assumptions include projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows.  Typical of a real estate acquisition, t  here was   no   goodwill recorded   as the purchase price did not exceed the fair value estim  ates of the net acquired assets.    

The following table summarizes the final allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, as well as adjustments made during the measurement period  : 

(1)     The balances were translated into U.S. Dollars based on the applicable exchange rate as of the date of acquisition, December 23, 2015. 

(2  )     The measurement period adjustments were mainly due to the finalization of the valuations of the tangible land, building and improvements, site improvements and tenant improvements, as well as valuations of intangible assets and liabilities typically present in an acquisition of a regional mall with existing tenancies.  This resulted in a reallocation of the purchase price from Building to other tangible assets (site and tenant improvements), as well as to intangible assets, including above and below market leases, in-place leases and unamortized lease origination costs.   

Investment and Development Property 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our investment and development property is summarized below:

Note   6     Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Entities 

Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, except for Rialto Distribution, which is accounted for as a cost method investment  .

For the   quarte  r and nine   months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded our share of equity earnings from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and entities a  s follows  : 

Note   7     Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

T  he table below summarizes   goodwill   by   business   segment   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   

The Company is required to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and  ,   if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.    Our next annual evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 201  6  .    To test the impairment of goodwill, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  ,     including the goodwill  ,     to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. A reporting unit is generally one level below the operating segment.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we were not aware of any events that made us believe potential impairment of goodwill had occurred.  

The tables below summarize intangible assets   other than goodwill as of     September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  

13   

Beneficial leases are amortized over the life of the lease up to     30   years  , trade names are amortized based on the accelerated   amortization method over its estimated useful life of   45   years, and other intangible assets   are amortized   over   the  ir     estimated useful lives   of up to 30 years (except for transferrable liquor licenses, which are   indefinite-lived assets  )  .    The table below summarizes the amortization expense of intangible assets for the   quarter and   nine     months   ended     September   30, 2016   and   September   30, 2015  , respectively.  

Note   8     Prepaid and Other Assets 

Prepaid and other assets are summarized a  s follows  : 

Note   9     Income Tax  

The provision for income taxes is different from the amount determined by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate to consolidated income before taxes.  The differences are attributable to earnings considered indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, change in valuation allowance, state taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, and foreign withholding tax on interest. Our effective tax rate was   3  1  .  8  %   and   19.2%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The rate difference was primarily caused by the Company's   determination     during the second quarter of 2015 that earnings of Australian subsidiaries are indefinitely invested in foreign operations  .

Note 10   Debt  

The Company s borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, net of deferred financing costs and including the impact of interest rate swaps on effective interest rates, are summarized below: 

(1)   Effective interest rate includes the impact of interest rate derivatives hedging the interest rate risk associated with Trust Preferred Securities and Bank of America Credit Facility that were outstanding as of   September 30, 2016. 

(2)   The contractual facilities and outstanding balances of the FC-denominated borrowings were translated into U.S. dollars based on the applicable exchange rates as of   September 30, 2016  . 

(3)   Net of deferred financing costs amounting to   $1.8   million. 

(4)     The loan   for our Minetta   Orpheum   Theatres was obtained f  rom   Santander   Bank.     T  he Union Square line of credit was obtained through East West Bank.    We are currently in the process of negotiating a construction loan for our Union Square property that will pay-off this loan with East West Bank.    The term loan for our Cinema 1,2,3 Theatr  e, w  hich   was previously provided by Santander Bank, was refinanced during the third quarter of 2016 with Valley National Bank.  Refer below for further discussion. 

(1)   Effective interest rate includes the impact of interest rate derivatives hedging the interest rate risk associated with Trust Preferred Securities and Bank of America Credit Facility that were outstanding as of December 31, 2015. 

(2)   The contractual facilities and outstanding balances of the FC-denominated borrowings were translated into U.S. dollar based on the applicable exchange rates as of December 31, 2015. 

(3)   The balance as of December 31, 2015 included the reclassification adjustment relating to netting of deferred financing costs amounting to   $1.8   million, as discussed in   Note 1   Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements  . 

(4)   The loans for our Cinema 1,2,3 and Minetta   Orpheum Theatres   we  re obtained from Bank of Santander.  The Union Square line of credit was obtained through East West Bank. 

Cinema 1,2,3   Term Loan 

On August 31, 2016,   Sutton Hill Properties LLC   ( SHP )  , a   75%   subsidiar  y of Reading International Inc., refinanced its   $15   million Santander Bank term loan with a different lender, Valley National Bank.  This new   $20   million loan is collateralized by our Cinema 1,2,3 property and bears an interest rate of   3.25%   per annum, with principal installments and accruing interest paid monthly. The new loan matures on   September 1, 2019  , with a one-time option to extend maturity date for another year.  

15   

Prior to the above refinancing, o  n June 27, 2016,   SHP   obtained approval from Santander Bank to extend the maturity of our   $15   million mortgage term loan from   July 1, 2016   to   October 1, 2016  .  This term extension was not considered substantial in accordance with US GAAP.    This term loan was subsequently paid prior to its extended maturity date on August 31, 2016 as a result of the refinancing discussed in the previous paragraph.    In conjunction with the extension, our line of credit with Santander Bank amounting to   $6.0   million was deactivated effective July 1, 2016.  The Company did not make any drawdown against this line of credit.  

Bank of America Credit Facility 

On March 3, 2016, we amended our   $55.0   million credit facility with Bank of America to permit real property acquisition loans.  This amendment was subject to the provision that the consolidated leverage ratio would be reduced by   0.25%   from the established levels in the credit facility during the period of such borrowing subject further to a repayment of such borrowings on the earlier of the eighteen months from the date of such borrowing or the maturity date of the credit agreement.  Such modification was not considered substantial in accordance with US GAAP.  

Note 11   Other Liabilities 

Other liabilities are summarized as follows: 

On August 29, 2014  ,   the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP ) that was effective since March 1, 2007, was ended and replaced with a new pension annuity.  As a result of the termination of the SERP program, the accrued pension liability of   $7.6   million  was reversed and replaced with a new pension annuity liability of   $7.5   million.  The valuation of the liability is based on the present value of   $10.2   million discounted at a rate of   4.25%   over a   15  - year term, resulting in a monthly payment of   $57,000   payable to the Cotter   Estate or Cotter Trust (as defined herein)  .  The discount rate of 4.25% has been applied since 2014 to determine the net periodic benefit cost and plan benefit obligation and is expected to be used in future years.  The discounted value of   $2.7   million (which is the difference between the estimated payout of $10.2 million and the present value of $7.5 million) as of August 29, 2014 will be amortized and expensed based on the 15-year term.  In addition, the accumulated actuarial loss of   $3.1   million recorded, as part of other comprehensive income will also be amortized based on the   15  -  year term. 

As a result of the above, included in our current and non-current liabilities are accrued pension costs of   $7.9   million at   September 30, 2016  .  The benefits of our pension plans are fully vested   and   therefore     no   service costs were recognized for the     quarter and   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.    Our pension plans are unfunded.    During   the     quarter and   nine   months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the   interest cost   was     $45,000     and   $135,000  , respectively,   and actuarial loss   was     $52,000   and   $116,000  , respectively  .       During   the     quarter and   nine     month  s   ended   September 30, 2015  , the   interest cost   was     $45,000     and   $135,000  , respectively,   and actuarial loss   was     $51,000   and   $155,000  , respectively  .

Litigation  

The STOMP Arbitration  

In April 2016, we received a Final Award in our arbitration with The STOMP Company Limited Partnership   ( Stomp )  , the producer of the show STOMP,   which has been   playing at our Orpheum Theater in New York City for 20 years   and still continues to play to   this   da  y  .   The Final Award awards us   $2.3   million in attorney s fees and costs.    In September 2016,   t  he parties   agreed on the payment terms   of the Final Award   ( Payment Agreement )  , on a basis that is intended to allow recovery by the Company of the entire Final Award (plus interest at   4%  ),   while   at the same     time   allowing     the show to continue playing at our Orpheum Theater  .    Under the Payment Agreement, Stomp   made   an initial payment of   $325,000     on   September   28,   2016 and the remaining amount   to   be paid over   time  ,    with final payment   due and payable     in   June 2019.    We have filed a   judgment   of the arbitral award   against Stomp with the   New York Supreme Court   to protect the Company in the event Stomp defaults on the Payment Agreement  .        STOMP continues to play at our  Orpheum Theater under a license agreement that was amended by the Payment Agreement. 

Derivative Litigation 

I  n    July 2016,   all of   the stockholder plaintiffs in the consolidated derivative cases other than James J. Cotter, Jr. (the    Independent   Plaintiff Stockholders)   entered into a settlement agreement with the Company and all of the Company s directors (other than James J. Cotter Jr  .)   withdrew their claims. The settlem  ent was approved by the   District Court of the State of Nevada for Clark County   and the judgment dismissing with prejudice the claims of the Independent Plaintiff Stockholders was entered on October 20, 2016  .    Under the judgment, each party is to bear its own legal fees  .       In the joint press release issued by the Company and the   Independent   Plaintiff Stockholders   on July 13, 2016  , representatives of the   Independent   Plaintiff Stockholders stated as follows:    "We are pleased with the conclusions reached by our investigations as Plaintiff Stockholders and now firmly believe that the Reading Board of Directors has and will continue to protect stockholder interests and will continue to work to maximize shareholder value over the long term.  We appreciate the Company's willingness to engage in open dialogue and are excited about the Company's prospects. Our questions about the termination of James Cotter, Jr., and various transactions between Reading and members of the Cotter family-or entities they control-have been definitively addressed and put to rest. We are impressed by measures the Reading Board has made over the past year to further strengthen corporate governance.  We fully support the Reading Board and management team and their strategy to create stockholder value.  

O  n August 3, 2016 James J. Cotter Jr., filed a motion with the Court seeking permission to file a  Second Amended Verified Complaint  (the  SAP )  , which motion has been approved  .         

The SAP adds as defendants Directors Judy Codding and Michael Wrotniak   It adds additional purported claims including purported claims relating to the selection of Ellen Cotter to serve as our Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, the retention of Margaret Cotter to serve as our Executive Vice President responsible for our live theater operations   and the management and development of our New York properties  , the ability of Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter to vote   100,000   share of our Class B stock, issued upon the exercise of certain stock options held of record by the Estate of James J. Cotter, Sr.,  and the handling by our Board of Directors of an indication of interest received at the end of May relating to the purchase of all of the stock of our Company.   

Discovery is continuing.  No trial date has been scheduled. 

To date, except for a $500,000 deductible, the bulk of the out-of-pocket costs associated with the defense of the above described litigation has been covered by the Company s Directors and Officers Insurance.    However, the $10,000,000 limits of that policy have now been exhausted.  Accordingly, the costs of such defense going forward will be a general administrative expense of the Company.

Debt Guarantee 

The total estimated debt of unconsolidated joint ventures and entities, consisting solely of Rialto Distribution (see   Note 6   Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Entities  ), was   $1.  1   million   (NZ$  1.5   million  ) as of   September 30, 2016   and   $1.0   million (  NZ$1.5   million) as of December 31, 2015. Our share of the unconsolidated debt, based on our ownership percentage, was   NZ$500,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.  This debt is guaranteed by one of our subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership percentage.  Based on the financial position of Rialto Distribution and in consideration of this debt guarantee, we accrued   $364,500    (  NZ$500,000  ) and   $342,000    (  NZ$500,000  ) as of   September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, recorded as part of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Summary of Controlling and Noncontrolling Stockholders  Equity 

A summary of the changes in controlling and noncontrolling stockholders  equity is as   follows  : 

Note 15   Equity and Stock-Based Compensation 

Employee and Director Stock Option Plan 

The Company may grant stock options and other share-based payment awards of our Class A Stock to eligible employees, directors, and consultants under the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ).   The aggregate total number of shares of the Class A Nonvoting Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan is   1,250,000  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   551,800   shares remaining for future issuances.   

Since the adoption of the Plan in 2010, the Company has granted awards primarily in the form of stock options.  In the 1  st   quarter of 2016, the Company started to award restricted stock units ( RSUs ) to directors and certain members of management.    Stock options are generally granted at exercise prices equal to the grant-date market prices and typically expire no later than five years from the grant date.    In contrast to a stock option where the grantee buys the Company s share at an exercise price determined on grant date, an RSU entitles the grantee to receive one share for every RSU based on a vesting plan.  At the discretion of our Compensation and Stock Options Committee, the vesting period of stock options and RSUs ranges from   zero   to   four   years.  At the time the options are exercised or RSUs vest, at the discretion of management, we will issue treasury shares or make a new issuance of shares to the option or RSU holder. 

Stock Options 

We estimate the grant-date fair value of our stock options using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model, which takes into account assumptions such as the dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility, and the expected life of the options.  We expense the estimated grant-date fair values of options over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Based on our historical experience and the relative market price to strike price of the options, we have not hereto estimated any forfeitures of vested or unvested options. 

19   

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, the weighted average assumptions used in the option-valuation model were as follows:  

For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded compensation expense of   $74,000   and   $264,000  , respective  ly.    For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded compensation expense of   $75,000   and   $209,000  , respective  ly.    At September 30, 2016, the total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was   $661,000  , which we expect to recognize over a weighted average vesting period of   1.94   years.    No   stock options were exercised during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The intrinsic, unrealized value of all options outstanding, vested and expected to vest, at September 30, 2016 was   $2.1   million, of which   75.8%   are currently exercisable. 

The following table summarizes the information of options outstanding and exercisable as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015: 

Termination     of Previous President s   Unvested   Stock Options 

Mr. James Cotter, Jr. has asserted in past communications with the Company that options to acquire   50,000   shares of Class A Stock  ,   issued to him in connection with his retention as the President of our Company  ,   survived his termination   as President  .    We continued to show these options as outstanding   in our previous filings  , pending a determination of the issue by our Compensation and Stock Options Committee.   On August 3, 2016, our Compensation and Stock Options Committee   met, reviewed the issue and   determined that such   50,000   options   had in fact   terminated with the termination of Mr. Cotter, Jr s employment as President.  Accordingly,   these options are not, and have not been since the effective date of Mr. Cotter, Jr s termination, outstanding and   the aggregate currently outstanding options are   582,000  .    This was recorded as a forfeiture during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.   

Restricted Stock Units 

We estimate the grant-date fair values of our RSUs using the Company s stock price at grant-date and record such fair values as compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.  In March 2016 and April 2016, RSU awards of   62,528   units and   5,625   units, respectively, were granted to   both our   directors and certain members of management.  These RSU awards aggregating to   68,153   units remained unvested as of   September   30, 2016.  These RSU awards vest   25%   at the end of each year for   4   years (in the case of members of management) and vest   100%   at the end of   one   year (in the case of directors).  During the quarter and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, we recognized compensation expense of   $130,000   and   $290,000  , respectively.  The total unrecognized compensation   expense   related to these unvested RSUs was   $526,000   as of   September   30, 2016.  

20   

Common Stock Buyback 

On May 16, 2014, the Company's   B  oard of   D  irectors authorized management, at its discretion, to spend up to an aggregate of   $10.0   million to acquire shares of Reading s Common Stock. This approved stock repurchase plan supersedes and effectively cancelled the program that was approved by the board on May 14, 2004, which allowed management to purchase up to   350,000   shares of Reading s Common Stock.  

The repurchase program allows Reading to repurchase its shares in accordance with the requirements of the SEC on the open market, in block trades and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.  All purchases are subject to the availability of shares at prices that are acceptable to Reading, and accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the timing or number of shares that may ultimately be acquired pursuant to this authorization. 

Under this approved buyback program, the Company has repurchased   $7.2   million worth of common stock at an average price of   $12.92   per share.  This leaves   $2.8     million available   under the May 16, 2014   for repurchase as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Management currently intends to use this $2.8 million in full   before the end of the year   to acquire additional shares of common stock, subject to the cost of such shares and the Company s other cash needs  . 

Note 16   Derivative Instruments 

We enter into interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk that results from the characteristics of our floating-rate borrowings. Our use of derivative transactions is intended to reduce long-term fluctuations in cash flows caused by market movements. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value through interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not designated any of our derivatives as accounting hedges.  

The Company s derivative positions measured at fair value are summarized in the following tables:  

The following table summarizes the unrealized gains or losses due to changes in fair value of the derivatives that are recorded in interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .   

Note 1  7     Fair Value Measurements 

ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurement   establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  The statement requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities     

21   

Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets     

Level 3:   Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable     

The following tables summarize our financial assets and financial liabilities carried and measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , by level within the fair value hierarchy.  

The following tables summarize our financial liabilities that are carried at cost and measured at fair value on a   non-  recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , by level within the fair value hierarchy.  

(1)   These balances are   presented   before any deduction for   deferred financing costs  . 

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Level 1 investments in marketable securities primarily consist of investments associated with the ownership of marketable securities in U.S. and New Zealand. These investments are valued based on observable market quotes on the last trading date of the reporting period.  

22   

Level 2 derivative financial instruments are valued based on discounted cash flow models that incorporate observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves from the derivative counterparties. The credit valuation adjustments associated with our non-performance risk and counterparty credit risk are incorporated in the fair value estimates of our derivatives.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we concluded that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.    

Level 3 borrowings include our secured and unsecured notes payable, trust preferred securities and other debt instruments.  The borrowings are valued based on discounted cash flow models that incorporate appropriate market discount rates. We calculated the market discount rate by obtaining period-end treasury rates for fixed-rate debt, or LIBOR for variable-rate debt, for maturities that correspond to the maturities of our debt, adding appropriate credit spreads derived from information obtained from third-party financial institutions.  These credit spreads take into account factors such as our credit rate, debt maturity, types of borrowings, and the loan-to-value ratios of the debt.  

The Company s financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and account payable.  The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values. Additionally, there were   no   transfers of assets and liabilities between levels 1, 2, or 3 during the   quarter and   nine   months     ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 

NOTE 18   Subsequent Events 

Opening of Olino, West Oahu in Hawaii 

On October 21, 2016, we opened   Olino by Consolidated Theatres, our ninth theatre and first to break ground since 2001 in the state of Hawaii.    T  his location features an eight-screen, state-of-the-art cinema at Ka Makana Ali i, a   1.4   million square foot regional mall in West Oahu. 

Potential Prepayment of Burwood Property Sales Proceeds 

Frasers Property Australia, the buyer of our Burwood Property, informed us that it is under contract to sell a portion of this property and a potential prepayment of   $16.7   million (  AU$21.8   million) is expected during the fourth quarter of 2016.   

Amendment to Bank of America Line of Credit 

In October 2016, we amended our   $5.0   million line of credit with Bank of America to provide   an   extension   of the term   by   two   (2) years, from   October 31, 2017   to   October 31, 2019  .  In addition, the amendment provided some changes to our debt covenants, including the elimination of minimum unencumbered liquid assets covenants.  This modification was not considered substantial in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Amendment to Westpac Bank Corporate Credit Facility 

In October 2016, we amended our   $36.4 million (  NZ$50.0   million  )   credit facility with Westpac Bank to provide a   $2.2   million (  NZ$3.0   million  )   increase, thereby amendi  ng the total credit facility to   $38.6   million (  NZ$53.0   million  )  .  The increase in the credit facility was specific to the second tranche   of our credit facility which is a dedicated construction facility, now of   $13.1   million (  NZ$18.0   million)   from the original limit of   $10.9   million (  NZ$15.0   million  )  .

In light of the Board s re-affirmation of its June 23, 2016 determination, management was directed to advise Patton Vision, LLC, that the Board has no interest in pursuing a sale of the Company at this time.

Item   2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

We are an internationally diversified company principally focused on the development, ownership, and operation of entertainment and real   estate   assets in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.  Currently, we operate in two business segments: 

cinema exhibition, through our   5  7   multiplex cinemas; and     

real estate, including real estate development and the rental of retail, commercial, and live theater assets.      

We believe   that these two business segm  ents can complement one another,   as we can use the comparatively consistent cash flows generated by our cinema operations  , in part,   to fund the front-end cash demands of our real estate development business. 

We manage our worldwide cinema exhibition businesses under various different brands: 

in the US, under the   following brands:   Reading   Cinema  s  , Angelika Film Center, Consolidated   Theatr  e  s  , and City Cinemas;     

in Australia, under the Reading   Cinema  s   brand; and     

in New Zealand, under the Reading   Cinema  s     and Rialto brands.      

Cinema Activities 

We continue to   (i) consider new opportunities to expand our international cinema circuit, (ii) evaluate our existing cinema portfolio to determine ways to maximize profitability through strategic renovations or programming adjustments, and (iii) determine the most efficient ways to dispose of cinemas carrying unacceptable risk profiles on a go-forward basis.   To increase attendance and improve our cash flow, our operational strategy has focused on improving the overall experience of the cinema guest through (i) delivering a premium sight and sound   cinematic   presentation with a filmmaker focus, (  i  i  )     installation of recliner seating, (iii) expansion of the quality and variety of our food   beverage menu  , (iv) broaden  ing   the scope of our programming to increase attendance and box office, (v) deliver  ing   hospitality focused guest service  ,   (vi)   engag  ing     our guests through   better   design of our cinema spaces  ,    (vii) instituting reserved seating in certain locations,   and (vi  i  i)   improving our interaction on social and electronic media  .       

As we renovate and reposition   certain of   our existing   US   cinemas, we intend  ,   where practical  ,   to add beer and wine service and, at some locations, cocktail type beverages.    Over the past years, we   have obtained liquor licenses for   ten   U.S.   theater locations: (i)   both of our Texas locations   (Dallas and Plano)  ,    (ii) our theater in Fairfax, Virginia, (iii)    o  ne in Washington, D.C., (iv) three in San Diego, CA    (  Carmel Mountain  , Town Square   and Grossmont)  ,    (v) one in Sacramento, CA, and (vi) lastly  ,    two   in Hawaii   (Ward and   Olino  )  .   The   liquor license in our Ward Theatre     was   the first   ever   liquor license granted to a cinema on the island of Oahu.    Additionally, we have   four   pending applications     two   in   California   and one each in New York and New Jersey.      In our international cinema operations, we offer beer and wine menu options for nine of our cinema locations (Belmont, Westlakes, Epping, Chirnside, Waurn Ponds, Rhodes, Rouse Hill, Charlestown and Harbourtown) in Australia and three of our cinema locations (Courtenay, Dunedin and LynnMall) in New Zealand. 

Innovative value pricing, improved food and beverage offerings and proactive social media engagement with our customers was a primary focus and to that end social media has been a powerful tool for connecting with and marketing to customers in real time.  We have continued to focus upon our company wide customer service training program with a view to improving staff productivity, the quality of customer interactions and ultimately underpinning an improvement to our per capita transaction spend.   Refining  , enhancing   and remixing our food and beverage offer  ings   has been an ongoing initiative with a view to minimizing our cost of sales and improving the inventory blend of our over the counter customer offer  ings  . 

US cinema activities 

On October 21, 2016, we opened Olino   by Consolidated   Theatre  s  , our ninth theatre and   the   first to break ground since 2001   in   the   state   of Hawaii.    T  his location features an eight-screen, state-of-the-art cinema at Ka Makana Ali i, a 1.4 million square foot regional mall in West Oahu.    With   a    sleek architectural design that brings natural light into the welcome space of the cinema and luxurious amenities to create the most brilliant movie-going experience, the cinema is inspired by its name. Each of   O  lino s well-appointed auditoriums feature luxurious electric recliner seats, expansive wall-to-wall screens and pristine digital projection by Barco, the leader in digital cinema technology. Expanding on the cutting edge technology from the ico  nic   premium large format   TITAN XC   (Extreme Cinema)   at Ward Theatres, O  lino introduces a new premium TITAN XC experience, TITAN LUXE. Guests will enjoy the comfort of luxurious electric recliner seats and the newest Dolby Atmos multi-channel immersive sound, while watching Hollywood s late  st blockbusters on one of Hawai  i s biggest screens.        In addition to the traditional cinema concessions and 140 flavors offered by Coca-Cola Freestyle, a menu of locally inspired and freshly prepared items has been curated by former Food Network executive, Bruce Seidel (Hot Lemon Productions), and former Food Network chef, Santos Loo. Unique items guests can enjoy before, during or after their film include a Kim Chee Burger, Banh Mi-Style Hot Dog and Loaded Baked Potato Fries. A diverse selection of craft beers on draft and wines will be offered during select showtimes to guests ages 21 and over. Local specialty items from around the island will  

24   

be offered including a full gourmet coffee menu from Kai Coffee Hawaii, mini pies from The Hawaiian Pie Company and specialty macarons from the Instagram-famous Macarons by Tiffany. 

In October 2015, we reopened our Carmel Mountain theater in San Diego as an Angelika Film Center and Caf  featuring luxury recliners. Dedicated to exhibiting quality films and events, the sleek and modern Angelika Film Center   Cafe is a unique venue for San Diego s culturally rich community, offering diverse programming and a creative menu of craft beverages and foods. Each of the 12 elegantly-appointed auditoria at   this   Angelika feature full-recliner luxury seats in a stadium setting, pristine digital projection by Barco, the leader in digital cinema technology, Dolby 7.1 sound system, and reserved seating for a leisurely cinematic experience. With state-of-the-art digital presentation capabilities and events specialists, the Angelika is an ideal venue for a range of meetings and events, from corporate presentations to private gatherings  .    Carmel Mountain has generated over $  5  .  8   million in revenue during the first   nine months   of 2016  , well ahead of the pre-renovation performance.    

The lease entered into on April 17, 2014 with an affiliate of Edens ( EDENS ) providing for the development of a new state-of-the art Angelika Film Center at Union Market in Washington DC has been terminated due to cost and feasibility issues.     However, EDENS and the Company continue to discuss the development of a state-of-the art Angelika Film Center in an alternative location within the Union Market district.   In the interim, the Angelika Pop Up continues to operate in the Union Market district  .    

Reflecting our dedication to providing our guests a premium presentation, the Company entered into its first license agreement with IMAX.   The Company converted one auditorium at the cinema at the Valley Plaza Mall in Bakersfield, California to an IMAX presentation in time for the opening of  Star Wars: The Force Awakens  in December 2015.     Revenue   at Valley Plaza has increased 16  % over the same   nine   month period last year, driven by increased attendance and increased average ticket price  . 

On January 31, 2016, following our run of  Star Wars: The Force Awakens , we surrendered our Gaslamp Cinema in San Diego. We paid the landlord a $1.0 million negotiated termination fee, which was less expensive than continuing to operate an unprofitable theater at this location.  This cinema was acquired in 2008 as a part of the acquisition of a package of 15 locations from Pacific Theatres.  The cinema was, at that time, a substantial money-loser  ,   and the purchase price was calculated taking into account the losses generated by that cinema and the likelihood that such losses would continue into t  he future  .   The losses at Gaslamp   for the first   nine months   of 2016   have   been   reduced by $  1.0 million   compared to the same period last year  .    

Australia   and New Zealand   cinema activities 

In September 2015, we reopened our completely refurbished Reading Cinemas at Harbourtown Shopping Center on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, which is the largest theater by screen count on the Gold Coast and is a key asset within the group, having entertained more than ten million customers over the past fifteen years. The highlight of this renovation was the inclusion of our premium large format auditorium, TITAN XC (Extreme Cinema), which features a 66-foot wide  wall-to-wall  screen and Dolby Atmos, a fully immersive sound system that is being embraced by leading exhibitors and filmmakers worldwide as the next-generation sound in the cinema.  The renovation also included upgrades in the cinema s affordable luxury  dine-in  cinema, combining a fully licensed lounge bar and a full food menu. 

In November 2015, we opened the state-of-the-art Reading Cinemas LynnMall, our first   Auckland based   Reading   Cinemas   branded cinema complex, in New Lynn, New Zealand. The new state-of-the-art cinema complex brings Reading s premium offerings to the newly redeveloped LynnMall Shopping Centre, providing a compelling and convenient movie experience for the Centre s guests. The highlight of this cinema complex is the newly formatted TITAN XC (Extreme Cinema). To further enhance its position as a leading entertainment destination, we offer two luxury dine-in licensed  Premium Cinema  screens,   featuring luxury recliner seating and   a full food and beverage menu to provide   customers     a superior   movie going experience  .    This   cinema generated    $  3  .  7   million (NZ$  5  .  4   million)   of additional   revenue   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016  . 

Real Estate Activities 

Our business plan is to focus   our real estate development activities on (i) the improvement and expansion of our   existing ETCs   including (a)   adding   an anchor grocery store tenancy and additional general retail   at     our Courtenay Central development   in     Wellington  , New Zealand  , (b)   addi  ng     general retail and restaurant space for our   RedYard development in   Auburn  ,     a suburb of   Sydney, Australia,   and (c) adding additional   cinema   screens and retail space to our Cannon Park development in Townsville, Australia   (ii)   upgrading and   adding a state-of-the-art cinema and additional general retail to  our shopping center in Newmarket, a suburb of Brisbane in Australia  , thereby converting that shopping center into an ETC asset  , (  i  i  i  )    the redevelopment of our Union Square and Cinemas 1, 2, 3 properties in Manhattan   to achieve the highest and best use,   (  i  v) the   commercial exploitation of   our landholdings in Coachella, California (202 acres)  , zoned for residential and high density mixed-user uses     and   our landholdings in   Ma  nukau, New Zealand (  70.4   acres)   zoned for industrial use  , and (v)   the identification of   additional real estate development opportunities with an existing or potential entertainment focus  .           With the exception of Union Square     which has no tenants now due to   the commencement of construction of     our re-development plan   of that property  ,   our properties scheduled for improvement or expansion continue to   perform     at or around the same level as previous years.

US real estate activities 

We are continuing to   advance     the development of our Union Square property located in Manhattan. We have (i) received authorization  from the Landmarks   Preservation   Commission and approval   of     several   variance   requests   from the Board of Standard and Appeals  to develop the BKSK Architects  design  ,   which will add approximately 23,000 square footage of rentable space to the current square footage of the building   bringing the   approximate total of up to 73,  322     square feet of rentable space subject to lease negotiations   (inclusive of anticipated BOMA adjustments)     and the final tenant mix of retail and office uses  ,    (ii) continue to work with  Edifice Real Estate Partners, LLC, to assist in the supervision and administration of the project and an affiliate of CNY for preconstruction services, (iii) retained the real estate brokerage Newmark Grubb Knight Frank to serve as our exclusive marketing agent  , and   (iv) received demolition and building approval   of numerous   permit   applications    by the Department of Building in July 2016  , including the Alt-1 permit associated with the overall renovation of the structure  .       We have   finished abatement and     beg  a  n    internal demolition activities at the site.    We are in the process of obtaining a   commitment for $57.5 million of   construction financing   for   this property   and anticipate closing before year-end  .    We currently anticipate that construction will be completed by the second quarter of 2018.    Newmark advised us that retail tenant demand in our property continues to be strong  .   

Regarding our Cinemas 1,2,3 property in Manhattan, we have received the consent of   the 25%     minority member   of the entity   for   the redevelopment of the property. We are evaluating the potential to redevelop the property as a mixed use retail and residential and/or hotel property.  Further, we have completed a preliminary feasibility study and are currently in negotiations with the owner of the approximately 2,600 square foot corner parcel adjacent to our Cinemas 1,2,3 property on the corner of 60th Street and 3rd Avenue for the joint development of our properties.  A combination of the properties would produce approximately 121,000 square foot of FAR and approximately 140,000 square feet of gross buildable area.  No assurances can be given that we will be able to come to terms with the adjacent owner.     On     A  ugust     31,   2016, we   completed   a new three-year mortgage loan ($20  .0   million)   with     Valley National   Bank  , the proceeds of which   were   used to repay the mortgage on the property with the Bank of Santander ($15  .0   million), to repay Reading for its $2.9 million loan to Sutton Hill Properties, LLC (the owner of the property), and   for working capital purposes  .        This property   s   cinema   revenues continue to be   in line with previous years.    

As discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   above  , on April 11, 2016, we purchased for $11.2 million a 24,000 square foot Class B office building with 72 parking spaces located at 5995 Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City, California.  We intend to use approximately 50% of the leasable area for our headquarters offices and to lease the remainder to unaffiliated third parties.    We anticipate, when the move is complete and the excess space is leased, we will be able to reduce our headquarters occupancy cost by approximately $350,000 per annum.    

Australia real estate activities 

We received Planning Council approval   from the city of Brisbane, Australia   in June 2015 for the construction of an eight-screen cinema complex with 10,000 square feet of specialty retail to be located below the cinema and additional mezzanine level parking at our existing Newmarket (Brisbane, Australia) shopping center.    Construction   has   commence  d   in the third quarter of 2016, with a projected opening in the fourth quarter of 2017  .   On November 30, 2015, we acquired an approximately 23,000 square foot parcel adjacent to our tenant  ,   the Coles supermarket  ,   in Newmarket.  This property is currently improved with an office building. We intend, over time, to integrate this property into our Newmarket development.  This will increase Newmarket s footprint from approximately 204,000 to approximately 227,000  square feet.        The office building is now   100%   leased, under leases that permit us to terminate in the event of redevelopment of the property.    

On December 23, 2015, we acquired two adjoining ETCs in Townsville, Queensland, Australia for a total of $24.  2   million (AU$33.  4   million) comprising approximately 5.6 acres. The total gross leasable area of the two properties, the Cannon Park City Centre and the Cannon Park Discount Centre, is 133,000 square feet.  Our 75%-owned multiplex cinema at the Cannon Park City Centre is the anchor tenant of that center.  This acquisition is consistent with our business plan to own, where practical, the land underlying our entertainment assets.    We will be operating these two properties as a single ETC.     These sites have added an additional $  2  .  1   million (AU$  2  .  8   million) of revenue to our real estate segment for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015  .          

On May 12, 2014, we entered into a contract to sell our undeveloped 50.6 acre parcel in Burwood, Victoria, Australia, to Australand Holdings Limited (now known as Frasers Property Australia) for a purchase price of   $50.8   million (AU$65.0 million).  We received $5.9 million (AU$6.5 million) on May 23, 2014.  The   remaining purchase price of   $44.9   million (AU$58.5 million) is due on December 31, 2017.  The agreement provides for mandatory pre-payments in the event that any of the land is sold by the buyer, any such prepayment being in an amount equal to the greater of (a) 90% of the net sales price or (b) the balance of the purchase price multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the square footage of property being sold by the buyer and the denominator of which is the original square footage of the property being sold to the buyer.  The agreement does not provide for the payment of interest on the balance   owed.  The buyer has informed us that it is under contract to sell a portion of this property and   a potential prepay  ment of approximately $1  6  .  7   million (AU$  21.8   million) is   expected in the fourth quarter of 2016  .    

26   

New Zealand real estate activities 

We received town planning approval in May 2015 from the Wellingt  on City Council for a $12.1   million (NZ$17.0 million) supermarket development project at our Courtenay Central ETC (Wellington, New Zealand).  Currently, we continue to progress the addition of an approximately 36,000 square foot supermarket and approximately 4,000 square feet of general retail space.  The agreement to lease the supermarket   has been   signed, all parties have approved construction budgets for the supermarket   and a design build construction agreement has been entered into.   The project is currently in the design phase.   Our Tenant has advised us that they have   decided   to revisit their initial designs with an intent to upgrading the quality of the offering at the location and making their supermarket    premium     .     While we are pleased by our Tenant s determination to upgrade its design criteria, this will necessarily result in a delay in the commencement of construction and occupancy from dates previously reported.   Under the Agreement to Lease, our Tenant is responsible for any increase in our costs resulting from these design changes and any resultant delays  .    We expect this   supermarket development project to be completed during 2018  .    We are currently upgrading our parking structure   that is designed to have superior structural protection against earthquake damage.     W  e believe   this   will give us a competitive advantage not only in terms of parking but also as an amenity to our shopping center and cinema  .     Both the cinema and the real estate activity continue to operate in line with prior years.       

In   August   2016, the Auckland City Council   revised the zoning of   the agricultural portion of   our property   in Manukau (approximately 64.0 acres)   to light industr  ial uses.   6.4 acres of our Manu  kau property   were already   zoned   for     heavy     industrial   use  .  Light industrial uses include certain manufacturing, production, logistic, transportation, warehouse and wholesale distribution activities and, on an ancillary basis, certain office, retail and educational uses  .      That decision was subject to a public announcement process, and became final   i  n    September   2016.    Once   our zoning enhancement goal has been achieved, we   will   review our options with respect to the commercial exploitation of this asset. 

Refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more details on our cinema and real estate segments.

Nine     Month  s     Results: 

Revenue for the   nine   month  s     ended September 30, 2016     in  creased by     6%  , or   $11.8   million, to   $203.0   million and net income attributable to RDI common stockholders decreased by   54%  , or   $10.4     million, to   $9.1   million.  EPS for the   nine   months   ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by $0.  45   to $0.  39   from the prior-year   nine  -month period, mainly attributable to   (i)   one-time gain on sale of investment properties benefitting EPS by $0.47   in 2015   and   (ii)   higher general and administrative expenses in 2016.       These are   offset   and hence, improved the EPS,   by   (i)   higher earnings in 2016 resulting from increased attendance in our cinema businesses in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand   and   (ii)   lower borrowing costs  . 

General and administrative expense (non-segment)

The additional expenses incurred for the 2015 audit related to further review of the Company s tax matters for prior years.    We   do   not expect   any   additional expenses incurred in connection with the year-end audit and the expenses connected with the change in status of certain execu  tives  .      

The increase in legal expenses for the nine months   ended September 30, 2016   mainly relate to the defense of the derivative litigation, the James J.

Gain on sale of assets 

Net gain on sale of assets for the   nine  -month period decreased by   $10.6   million, primarily due to     the   following sale transactions resulting   in   gains realized in 2015  : (i)   the sale of our Doheny Condo in Los Angeles r  esulting in a $2.8 million gain   during Q1 2015  ,    (ii)   the closing of the sale of Moonee Ponds in Australia for a gain of $8  .0   million   (AU$10.3     million)     during Q2 2015   and   (iii)   the gain on the first of the two sale agreements for our Taupo Property in New Ze  aland in the amount of $  246  ,000   (NZ$  353  ,000)   during Q2 2015,     compared to the gain from the final closing of the   second   sale   agreement   of the Taupo property in New Zealand in the amount of $393,000     (  NZ  $585,000)   realized in Q1 2016  .

Real estate     segment   operating income     increased   by     22%  , or     $312,000  , to   $1.8   million for the   quarter   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  , primarily attributable to   the   increase in property rental income attributed   to   Cannon Park   purchased   in December 2015, offset by the closure of Union Square property for redevelopment  .    Please r  efer below for further explanation.  

Revenue 

Real estate revenue   for the three-month period   increased   by   8%,   or     $422,000  , mainly driven   by the   increase in p  roperty rental income attributable   to Cannon Park   in Australia, which was purchased   in December 2015  , and   the impact of   favorable   foreign exchange rate  s     o  n     our Australia and   New   Zealand operations  .  This was   offset by the   temporary   closure of Union Square property for redevelopment  .   

Operating expense 

Operating expense   for the   quarter     ended   September 30, 2016     decreased by   11%  , or   $274,000  , as a result of the   closure of   our   Union Square   property in New York and   the   sale of   our   Taupo property in New Zealand, offset by the purchase of Cannon Park   in Australia  .

Please r  efer below for further explanation.  

Revenue 

Real estate revenue   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     slightly increased   by     $53,000  , mainly driven by   the   increase in p  roperty rental income attributable   to Cannon Park   in Australia, which was purchased   in December 2015  .   This was offset by   lower property rental income from U.S. and New Zealand   due to the temporary closure of   our   Union Square New York property currently being re-developed and the sale of Taupo property in New Zealand, in addition to the   impact of   unfavorable foreign exchange rate  s     on our     Australia and   New   Zealand operations  .

BUSINESS PLAN, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Business p  lan 

Our cinema exhibition business plan is to continue to identify, develop, and acquire cinema properties, where reasonably available, that allow us to leverage our cinema expertise and technology over a larger operating base.    In addition, we are refurbishing our cinema properties where feasible, and adding (1) premium   projection and sound presentation, (2) recliner   seating when appropriate, and (  3  )    enhanced   food and beverage options   when possible. 

Our real estate business plan is   to   re-develop   our existing   property   assets, to be sensitive to opportunities to convert our entertainment assets to higher and better uses, or, when appropriate,   to   dispose of such assets.   

In addition, we review opportunities to monetize our assets where such action   could   lead to a financially acceptable outcome.  We will also continue to investigate potential synergistic acquisitions that may not readily fall into either of our two   cinema or real estate   segments.   

Liquidity and c  apital   r  esources 

Liquidity risk is the risk relating to our ability to meet our financial obligations when they come due. In today     s environment, our financial obligations arise mainly from   capital expenditure needs  ,    working capital requirements  ,   and     debt servicing requirements  . We manage the liquidity risk by ensuring o  ur ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities   and   to obtain adequate, reasonable financing and/or to convert non-performing or non-strategic assets into cash.       

The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows  :    

Operating activities 

Cash provided by operating activities during the current   nine  -month period   de  creased   by   $6.9   million  ,   to   $14.5   million,   primarily dri  ven by a     de  crease of   $  3  .  7   million in changes in operating assets and liabilities   and   by a   $  3  .  1   million decrease in operational cash flows. 

Investing activities 

Cash   provided by   investing activities during the current   nine  -month period   decreased   by     $44.2   million  ,   to   net cash used of     $35.5   million, primarily   due to     one-off cash inflows in 2015 from the sale of investment   properties   of $21.1 million and   the increase of $  21.3   million in purchases and capital expenditures   as part of our   real estate   development program  .   

Financing Activities 

The   $10.9   million   net   cash   provided by   financing activities   during the current   nine  -month period was   primarily   related to $  5  2  .  4   million   proceeds from borrowings, offset by $  4  0  .  8   million in   loan repayments.    

35   

We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business, while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. 

At     September 30, 2016  , our consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled   $10.0   million.  Of this amount,   $5.9   million and   $1.7   million w  ere   held by our Australia  n   and New Zealand subsidiaries, respectively.  Our intention is to indefinitely reinvest Australia  n   earnings but not indefinitely reinves  t New Zealand earnings. If the Australian   earnings were used to fund domestic operations, they would be subject to additional income taxes upon repatriation. 

We have historically funded our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, investments in the acquisition of individual properties primarily from internally generated cash flows   and lines of credit  .  The Company had   $55.7   million   unused   capacity of available corporate credit facilities at   September 30, 2016  .  In addition, we have   $1  3  .  1   million   (NZ$1  8  .0 million)   unused capacity   as   construction fundi  ng for New Zealand  .   

We   completed     the refinancing   of   our   $15.0 million   Santander Bank   Term Loan (USA) prior to the maturity date of   October   1, 2016   with a new lender,   into   a new 3-year term $20.0 million loan  .        In addition  , we are in the process of obtaining   (i)   a mortgage on the new corporate headquarters in Los Angeles that we purchased in April 2016  , and (ii) a construction financing on our Union Square property re-development project in New York  .    We   currently   expect these   two financing negotiation  s   to be completed during the   fourth   quarter of 2016. 

C  ONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS   AND   CONTINGENCIES 

The following table provides information with respect to the maturities and scheduled principal repayments of our recorded contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(  1  )     Information is presented exclusive of deferred financing costs. 

(  2  )     Estimated interest on debt is based on the anticipated loan balances for future periods and current applicable interest rates.  

(  3  )     Represents the lease liability of the option associated with the ground purchase of the Village East cinema  .   

Refer to   Note 13   Commitments and Contingencies   for additional information. 

Litigation 

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims.   

Where we are the plaintiffs, we expense all legal fees on an on-going basis and make no provision for any potential settlement amounts until received.  In Australia, the prevailing party is   usually   entitled to recover its attorneys  fees, which typically work out to be approximately 60% of the amounts actually spent where first class legal counsel is engaged at customary rates.  Where we are a plaintiff, we have likewise made no provision for the liability for the defendant s attorneys' fees in the event we are determined not to be the prevailing party. 

Where we are the defendants, we accrue for probable damages   that insurance may not cover   as they become known and can be reasonably estimated.  In our opinion, any claims and litigation in which we are currently involved are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial po  sition, or liquidity.  I  t is possible, however, that future results of the operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by the ultimate outcome of the legal proceedings.         Please refer to Item   3     Legal Proceedings in   the Company s   Annual Report   on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015   for more information.   There have been no material changes to our litigation exposure since our   201  5   Annual Report  , except as set forth in Item 1   Legal Proceedings  .

CRITICAL   A  CCOUNTING POLICIES 

The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management s view, most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and the most demanding in their calls on judgment.    W  e believe our most critical accounting policies relate to: 

impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets  ,     

tax valuation allowance and obligations  ,   and     

legal and environmental obligations.     

We discuss these critical accounting policies in our   2015   Annual Report and advise you to refer to that discussion.       

Refer to   Note 1     The Company   Basis of Presentation          Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements     for more information regarding new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements.  

F  INANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Currency and interest rate risk 

The Company     s objective in managing exposure to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges.           

We currently manage our currency exposure by creating, whenever possible, natural hedges in Australia and New Zealand.  This involves local country sourcing of goods and services as well as   borrowing in local currencies     to match revenues and expenses  .     Since we intend to conduct business   mostly   on a self-funding basis  , except for funds used to pay a  n appropriate share of our domestic corporate overhead), we do not believe the currency fluctuations presents a material risk to the Company.  As such, w  e    do not use derivative   financial instruments to hedge against the ris  k of foreign currency exposure.    

As we continue to progress with our acquisition and development activities in Australia and New Zealand, the effect of variations in currency values   of our assets and liabilities for Australia and New Zealand stated in US Dollars may   increase.    

Set forth below is a chart   reflecting the currency trends   for the Australian and New Zealand Dollar  s   vis- -vis the U  .  S  .   Dollar  s   over the past 20 years  . 

37   

Our exposure to interest rate risk arises out of our   intermediate term     floating-rate borrowings.  To manage the risk, we utilize interest rate derivative contracts to   convert   certain     floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings.   It is the Company s policy to enter into interest rate derivative transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into     these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. 

Inflation 

We continually monitor inflation and the effects of changing prices.  Inflation   increases   the cost of goods and services used.  Competitive conditions in many of our markets restrict our ability to recover fully the higher costs of acquired goods and services through price   increases  .  We attempt to mitigate the impact of inflation by implementing continuous process improvement solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency and, as a result, lower costs and operating expenses.  In our opinion, we have managed the effects of inflation appropriately, and, as a result, it has not had a material impact on our operations and the resulting financial position or liquidity.

our exposure from time to time to legal claims and to uninsurable risks such as those related to our historic railroad operations, including potential environmental claims and health-related claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos or other substances now or in the future recognized as being possible causes of cancer or other health related problems;     

o 

changes in future effective tax rates and the results of currently ongoing and future potential audits by taxing authorities having jurisdiction over our various companies; and      

o 

changes in applicable accounting policies and practices.     

The above list is not necessarily exhaustive, as business is by definition unpredictable and risky, and subject to influence by numerous factors outside of our control  ,   such as changes in government regulation or policy, competition, interest rates, supply, technological innovation, changes in consumer taste and fancy, weather, and the extent to which consumers in our markets have the economic wherewithal to spend money on beyond-the-home entertainment. 

Given the variety and unpredictability of the factors that will ultimately influence our businesses and our results of operation, it naturally follows that no guarantees can be given that any of our forward-looking statements will ultimately prove to be correct.  Actual results will undoubtedly vary and there is no guarantee as to how our securities will perform either when considered in isolation or when compared to other securities or investment opportunities. 

Finally, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or to revise any of our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable law.  Accordingly, you should always note the date to which our forward-looking statements speak. 

Additionally, certain of the presentations included in this interim quarterly report may contain  non-GAAP financial measures.   In such case, a reconciliation of this information to our GAAP financial statements will be made available in connection with such statements.

Item 3     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 

The SEC requires that registrants include information about potential effects of changes in currency exchange and interest rates in their filings.  Several alternatives, all with some limitations, have been offered.  We base the following discussion   on a sensitivity analysis that   models the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates.  This analysis is constrained by several factors, including the following: 

It is based on a single point in time; and     

It does not include the effects of other complex market reactions that would arise from the changes modeled.     

Although the results of such an analysis may be useful as a benchmark, they should not be viewed as forecasts. 

At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   45%   and   18%   of our assets were invested in assets denominated in Australian dollars (Reading Australia) and New Zealand dollars (Reading New Zealand), respectively, including approximately   $7.6   million in cash and cash equivalents.  At   December 31, 2015  , approximately   46%   and   19%   of our assets were invested in assets denominated in Australian dollars (Reading Australia) and New Zealand dollars (Reading New Zealand), including approximately   $10.4   million in cash and cash equivalents. 

Our policy in Australia and New Zealand is to match revenues and expenses, whenever possible, in local currencies.  As a result, we have procured a majority of our expenses in Australia and New Zealand     in local currencies  .  Despite this natural hedge, recent movements in foreign currencies have had an effect on our current earnings.  Although foreign currency has had an effect on our current earnings, the effect of the translation adjustment on our assets and liabilities noted in our other comprehensive income was an   in  crease   of   $9.3   million for the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016  .  As we continue to progress our acquisition and development activities in Australia and New Zealand, we cannot assure you that the foreign currency effect on our earnings will   not be material   in the future. 

Historically, our policy has been to borrow in local currencies to finance the development and construction of our   long-term assets   in Australia and New Zealand whenever possible.  As a result, the borrowings in local currencies have provided somewhat of a natural hedge against the foreign currency exchange exposure.  Even so, and as a result of our issuance of fully subordinated   Trust Preferred Securities   in 2007, and their subsequent partial repayment, approximately   76%   and   59%   of our Australian and New Zealand assets, respectively, remain subject to such exposure, unless we elect to hedge our foreign currency exchange between the US and Australian and New Zealand dollars.  If the foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by 10%, the resulting change in Australian and New Zealand assets would be   $13.7   million and   $4.4   million, respectively, and the change in our quarterly net income would be   $1.1     million   and   $263,000  , respectively.  Presently, we have no plan to hedge such exposure. 

We record unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses that could materially affect our financial position.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,    the balance of cumulative   foreign currency translation   adjustments was   approximately   $23.9   million   gain   and   $14.6   million   gain  , respectively. 

Historically, we maintain most of our cash and cash equivalent balances in short-term money market instruments with original maturities of three months or less.  Due to the short-term nature of such investments, a change of 1% in short-term interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition. 

We have a combination of fixed and variable interest rate loans. In connection with our variable interest rate loans, a change of approximately 1% in short-term interest rates would have resulted in approximately     $193,000     increase or decrease in our quarterly interest expense.

Item 4     Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s   reports filed under the Securities   Exchange Act   of 1934  , as amended   (the      Exchange Act     )  , is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such, term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

In 2015  , we noted a material weakness regarding certain controls related to income tax   accounting  .    Throughout 2016, w  e    have been   working assiduously to remediate these controls and   anticipate that these controls will be updated and fully implemented   by year-end  .    To this end,   during the third quarter of 2016,   we have hired a   Director of Tax   with a background in international tax accounting.    Since late 2015, we   have retained a Big 4 accounting firm to review our tax accounting on a quarterly and annual basis. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other than the hiring discussed above, n  o change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   Ot    her Information 

Item 1   Legal Proceedings  

There have been no material changes to the legal proceedings as previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K filed on April 29, 201  6   with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , except as disclosed below: 

Updates to The STOMP Arbitration        

In April 2016, we   received a Final Award in our arbitration with The STOMP Company Limited Partnership   ( Stomp )  , the producer of the show STOMP,   which has been   playing at our Orpheum Theater in New York City for 20 years   and still continues to play to this date  .   The Final Award awards us   $2.3   million in attorney s fees and costs.    In September 2016,   the parties agreed on the payment terms of the Final Award   ( Payment Agreement )  , on a basis that is intended to allow recovery by the Company of the entire Final Award (plus interest at 4%), while at the same time allowing the show to continue playing at our Orpheum Theater.    Under the Payment Agreement, Stomp   made   an initial payment of $325,000   on   September   28,   2016 and the remaining amount   to   be paid over time  ,    with final payment   due and payable     in   June 2019.    We have filed a   judgment   of the arbitral award   against Stomp with the   New York Supreme Court   to protect the Company in the event Stomp defaults on the Payment Agreement  .        STOMP continues to play at our  Orpheum Theater under a license agreement that was amended by the Payment Agreement. 

Updat  es to the Derivative Litigation        

I  n    July 2016,   all of   the stockholder plaintiffs in the consolidated derivative cases  other than James J. Cotter, Jr. (the    Independent   Plaintiff Stockholders)   entered into a settlement agreement with the Company and all of the Company s directors (other than James J. Cotter, Jr.) withdrew their claims. The settlement was approved by the   District Court of the State of Nevada for Clark County   and judgment dismissing with prejudice the claims of the Independent Plaintiff Stockholders was entered on October 20, 2016  .    Under the judgment, each party is to bear its own legal fees.    In the joint press release issued by the Company and the   Independent   Plaintiff Stockholders, representatives of the   Independent   Plaintiff Stockholders stated as follows:    "We are pleased with the conclusions reached by our investigations as Plaintiff Stockholders and now firmly believe that the Reading Board of Directors has and will continue to protect stockholder interests and will continue to work to maximize shareholder value over the long term.  We appreciate the Company's willingness to engage in open dialogue and are excited about the Company's prospects. Our questions about the termination of James Cotter, Jr., and various transactions between Reading and members of the Cotter family-or entities they control-have been definitively addressed and put to rest. We are impressed by measures the Reading Board has made over the past year to further strengthen corporate governance.  We fully support the Reading Board and management team and their strategy to create stockholder value.  

O  n August 3, 2016 James J. Cotter Jr., filed a motion with the Court seeking permission to file a  Second Amended Verified Complaint  (the  SAP )  , which motion has been approved  .         

The SAP adds as defendants Directors Judy Codding and Michael Wrotniak   It adds additional purported claims including purported claims relating to the selection of Ellen Cotter to serve as our Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, the retention of Margaret Cotter to serve as our Executive Vice President responsible for our live theater operations     and the management and development of our New York properties  , the ability of Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter to vote 100,000 share of our Class B stock, issued upon the exercise of certain stock options held of record by the Estate of James J. Cotter, Sr.,  and the handling by our Board of Directors of an indication of interest receive  d   at the end of May relating to the purchase of all of the stock of our Company  .       

Discovery is continuing.  No trial date has been scheduled. 

To date, except for a $500,000 deductible, the bulk of the out-of-pocket costs associated with the defense of the above described litigation has been covered by the Company s Directors and Officers Insurance.    However, the $10,000,000 limits of that policy have now been exhausted.  Accordingly, the costs of such defense going forward will be a general administrative expense of the Company.    

For   further details on our   legal proceedings,   please refer to Item 3,   Legal Proceedings  ,   contained in   such   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 1A   Risk Factors

			 the Borrower shall deliver to Mortgagee, together with the Renewal Notice and the Commitment Fee, a certificate in form acceptable to Mortgagee executed by Borrower s managing member certifying that each of the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in the Loan Documents is true, complete and correct in all material respects as of the date of such managing member s certificate except to the extent such representations and warranties are matters which by their nature can no longer be true and correct as a result of the passage of time.     

The Borrower shall have no further right to extend the Maturity Date beyond the Renewal Term Maturity Date. 

In the event that the Borrower shall exercise Borrower s right to extend the Maturity Date in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Note, during the Renewal Term, the outstanding principal amount advanced to Borrower under this Note shall be repaid as follows: 

(A) 
			 Eleven (11) equal consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest, in an amount as calculated pursuant to Interest Rate and Interest Calculations (as defined below) commencing on October 1, 2019, and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until and including August 1, 2020.     

(B) 
			 A final installment of principal in such amount as shall constitute the entire outstanding principal balance of this Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest as calculated pursuant to Interest Rate and Interest Calculations (as defined below), and all other sums due under this Note and/or the Mortgage (as defined below) due and payable in full on the Renewal Term Maturity Date.     

The monthly installments of principal and interest described above shall be based on a twenty-seven (27) year amortization schedule. 

2.      Interest Rate  .   

(A) 
			 The annual rate of interest payable under this Note (   Interest   ) for the period commencing on and including the date hereof through and including the Maturity Date (the    Initial Term   ) shall be calculated at a fixed rate equal to three and one fourth of one percent (3.25%) per annum,   provided   that the interest rate may be increased to the Default Interest Rate (as defined below) in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.     

EXHIBIT 10.1 

(B) 
			 Interest for the Renewal Term shall be calculated at a fixed rate equal to the prevailing One Year US Treasury Rate as of the date which is five (5) days preceding the Maturity Date, plus 225 basis points (2.25%), with the resulting number being rounded upwards to the nearest one-eighth of one percentage point (0.125%),   provided   that the interest rate may be increased to the Default Interest Rate in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.  One Year US Treasury Rate  shall mean the amount payable on the most recently issued one (1) year United States Treasury Bond, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal. If the One Year US Treasury Rate is no longer available, Mortgagee shall choose a new index based upon comparable information.  In no event shall the Interest rate be less than three and one-quarter of one percent (3.25%) per annum.     

3.      Interest Calculations  .  Interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal amount of this Note from the date hereof until all sums under this Note are paid in full.    Interest during the term hereof shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and actual number of days elapsed. 

4.      Application of Payments  .  Payments received under this Note (including prepayments) shall be applied first to accrued interest and then to installments of principal, in inverse order of their maturity dates.  Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Mortgagee shall have the right, at its sole option, to apply any payment received under this Note first to any late fees, collection or other expenses to which Mortgagee may be entitled under this Note, the Mortgage (as defined below) or any other Loan Document.  The making of any partial prepayment shall not change the due dates or amounts of monthly installment payments next becoming due, but shall only change the allocations of future payments of interest and principal based on such prepayment and produce possibly an earlier payoff date on this Note. 

5.      Late Fee  .    If any payment (including tax or insurance escrow payments) is not received by Mortgagee within fifteen (15) days following its due date, without limiting any right or remedy under this Note, the Mortgage or any other Loan Document, Mortgagee may charge a late fee equal to Four Percent (4%) of the total amount overdue. 

6.      Prepayments  .  Prepayment of the Loan is permitted at any time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Mortgagee. Such prepayment must be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount being prepaid and any and all applicable charges due under the Loan Documents.  All prepayments shall be applied first to any outstanding charges or fees relating to the Loan, then to interest and then to principal.  

On the date of any prepayment or modification of the Loan, in whole or in part, (each, a    Prepayment Date   ), the Borrower shall pay, in the Mortgagee s sole discretion under such modification agreement, if any, to the Mortgagee a prepayment premium, equal to the following: 

(a)  two percent (2%) of the amount being prepaid or modified if paid or modified before the first year anniversary of the First Payment Date, 

EXHIBIT 10.1 

(b) one percent (1%) of the amount being prepaid or modified if paid or modified on or after the first year anniversary of the First Payment Date and before the second year anniversary of the First Payment Date, 

(c) one percent (1%) of the amount being prepaid or modified if paid or modified on or after the second year anniversary of the First Payment Date and before the twenty-seventh month anniversary of the First Payment Date, and 

(d) no prepayment premium if paid or modified on or after the twenty-seventh month anniversary of the First Payment Date and on or before the Maturity Date. 

In the event that the Borrower shall exercise Borrower s right to extend the Maturity Date in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Note, on any Prepayment Date which occurs during the Renewal Term, the Borrower shall pay to the Mortgagee a prepayment premium, equal to one-half of one percent (0.50%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Loan, provided that no prepayment premium shall due with respect to any Prepayment Date which occurs during the last ninety (90) days of the Renewal Term. 

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Note, the Mortgagee shall not be required to accept partial prepayments of the Loan. 

Borrower acknowledges that the prepayment premiums provided for in this Note were a material inducement for Mortgagee to make the Loan, advance funds under this Note and offer the interest rate provided for in this Note.  Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that the prepayment premiums shall be unconditionally due and payable if prepayment in full or in part of this Note is made prior to   THE ACTUAL DATE AFTER WHICH NO PREMIUM WILL BE OWED  , regardless of whether the prepayment occurs after the occurrence of an Event of Default, the acceleration of the Loan and/or the institution of legal proceedings by Mortgagee to collect on this Note or foreclose on the Mortgage. 

The above prepayment premium shall apply if the Loan is modified by Mortgagee and Borrower during the Prepayment Date. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that no Event of Default exists hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, in the event of any involuntary prepayment due to a casualty or condemnation relating to the Mortgaged Property, no prepayment premium shall be due. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note, provided no Event of Default exists hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, Borrower may prepay up to ten percent (10%) of the then outstanding     principal balance of the Loan during each year of the Loan (i.e., once per year) with no prepayment premium. 

7.      Place and Manner of Payment  .  Payments under this Note are to be made in United States currency at the offices of Mortgagee listed in this Note or at such other location designated by Mortgagee.  Without limiting in any way Mortgagee s right of setoff against Borrower, Mortgagee is authorized and directed to apply funds in any account in the name of  

EXHIBIT 10.1 

Borrower with Mortgagee to make any payments under this Note without any additional authorization, from, and without prior notice to, the undersigned.  Any delay by Mortgagee in submitting a statement of any amount due under this Note shall not relieve Borrower of its duty to inquire as to the amount due and to make timely payments.

9.      Defaults and Remedies  .

Mortgagee s delay or failure to accelerate this Note or to exercise any other available right or remedy shall not impair any such right or remedy, nor shall it be construed to be a forbearance or waiver.  The term  Default Interest Rate  means a rate of Five Percent (5%) in excess of the interest rate provided for in this Note. Unless otherwise agreed to by Mortgagee, the Default Interest Rate shall (a) be applied retroactively to the date of the first occurrence of the default, (b)  be computed on a three hundred sixty (360) day year based on a 30/360 day basis, and (c) survive entry of any judgment relating to the Loan. 

10.      New York Law  . This Note has been executed and delivered at and shall be deemed to have been made in the State of New York and shall in all respects be governed by and construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the internal laws, including the conflict of law rules, of the State of New York, except to the extent that procedural matters must be governed by the law of the jurisdiction wherein the Mortgaged Property is located.  Whenever possible, each provision of this Note shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law; but if any provision of this Note shall be prohibited by or be invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Note. 

11.      Partial Invalidity  .  If any term or provision of this Note is at any time held to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining terms and provisions of this Note shall not be affected and shall remain in full force and effect.
