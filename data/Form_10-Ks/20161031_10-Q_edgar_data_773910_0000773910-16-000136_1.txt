1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
    
  General    Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and marketing of oil, condensate, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs), and in the marketing of anticipated production of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In addition, the Company engages in the gathering, processing, treating, and transporting of oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs. The Company also participates in the hard-minerals business through royalty arrangements. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms  Anadarko  and  Company  refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
  Basis of Presentation    The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Anadarko and subsidiaries in which Anadarko holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights and variable interest entities (VIEs) for which Anadarko is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Undivided interests in oil and natural-gas exploration and production joint ventures are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in noncontrolled entities over which Anadarko has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies and VIEs for which Anadarko is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. In applying the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost, and subsequently adjusted for the Company s proportionate share of earnings, losses, and distributions. Other investments are carried at original cost. Investments accounted for using the equity method and cost method are reported as a component of other assets. 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards    The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   and ASU 2015-15,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  . These ASUs require capitalized debt issuance costs, except for those related to revolving credit facilities, to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, rather than as an asset. The Company adopted these ASUs on January 1, 2016, using a retrospective approach. The adoption resulted in a reclassification that reduced other current assets and short-term debt by $1 million and reduced other assets and long-term debt by $82 million on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. 
  The FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2016. In accordance with the new ASU, Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP) and Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), publicly traded consolidated subsidiaries of the Company, are considered VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Prior to adoption of the ASU, WGP and WES were consolidated by the Company under the voting interest model. After adoption, WGP and WES were consolidated by the Company under the variable interest model. While this ASU requires additional financial statement disclosure, it has no impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. See    Note 17 Variable Interest Entities   .    
    
  New Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted    The FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  . This ASU requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs and eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2018 and is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   (Continued) 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . This ASU provides clarification on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2018 and is required to be adopted using a retrospective approach if practicable, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
  The FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This ASU simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows, and accounting for forfeitures. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this ASU beginning on January 1, 2017, and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  The FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   This ASU requires the lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on the balance sheet and disclose key information about their leasing transactions. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  The FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ,     which supersedes current revenue recognition requirements and industry-specific guidance. The codification was amended through additional ASUs and, as amended, requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is required to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company is continuing to evaluate the provisions of this ASU and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures or decided upon the method of adoption. 

2.  Inventories    
    
  The following summarizes the major classes of inventories included in other current assets:

3.  Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale    
    
  Acquisition    In September 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire certain oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico for   $2.0 billion   using a portion of the net proceeds from the September 2016 issuance of   40.5 million   shares of its common stock. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is subject to customary closing conditions. See    Note 14 Stockholders  Equity   . 
    
  Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale    For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company received   $1.3 billion   in net proceeds from divestitures and recognized net losses of   $516 million   from divestitures and assets held for sale.  
    
  Divestitures    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company divested the following U.S. onshore assets: 
             
    certain West Texas assets in the oil and gas exploration and production and midstream reporting segments for net proceeds of   $223 million   and a loss of   $50 million 
                
    certain East Texas/Louisiana assets in the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment for net proceeds of   $199 million   and a net loss of   $41 million 
                
    certain Wyoming assets in the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment for net proceeds of   $588 million   and a loss of   $59 million 
       
  Assets Held for Sale    Losses on assets held for sale are included in gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain U.S. onshore assets located primarily in East Texas included in the oil and gas exploration and production and midstream reporting segments satisfied criteria to be considered held for sale during the third quarter of 2016, at which time the Company remeasured these assets to their current fair value using a market approach and Level 2 fair-value measurement and recognized a loss of   $355 million  . The sale of these assets is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. At   September 30, 2016,   the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet included long-term assets of   $1.1 billion  , which includes   $184 million   of goodwill, and long-term liabilities of   $44 million   associated with assets held for sale.

4.  Impairments    
    
  Impairments of Long-Lived Assets    Impairments of long-lived assets are included in impairment expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. The following summarizes impairments of long-lived assets and the related post-impairment fair values by segment: 

__________________________________________________________________ 
            (1)   
    Measured as of the impairment date using the income approach and Level 3 inputs.  
               (2)   
    Represents the after-tax net investment. 
       
  Impairments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were primarily related to U.S. onshore oil and gas and midstream properties due to changes in development plans. Impairments during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , were primarily related to U.S. onshore oil and gas properties and an oil and gas property in the Gulf of Mexico, all of which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices. Impairments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015,   were primarily related to the Company s Greater Natural Buttes oil and gas and midstream properties, certain other U.S. onshore oil and gas and midstream properties, and oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico, all of which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices.  
    
  Impairments of Unproved Properties    Impairments of unproved properties are included in exploration expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a   $109 million   impairment of unproved Utica properties resulting from an assignment of mineral interests in settlement of a legal matter. The Company also recognized a   $935 million   impairment of unproved Greater Natural Buttes properties during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015,   as a result of lower commodity prices.

4.  Impairments   (Continued) 
    
  Potential for Future Impairments    At September 30, 2016, the Company s estimates of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a certain international asset group with a net book value of approximately   $1.4 billion  , and certain U.S. onshore asset groups with a combined net book value of approximately   $1.1 billion  , indicated that the carrying amounts were expected to be recovered; however, these asset groups may be at risk for impairment if the estimates of future cash flows decline. The Company estimates that a   10%   decline in oil prices (with all other assumptions unchanged) could result in a non-cash impairment in excess of   $600 million   for the international asset group, and a   10%   decline in natural-gas prices (with all other assumptions unchanged) could result in non-cash impairments in excess of   $400 million   for the U.S. onshore asset groups. It is also reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, further changes to the Company s drilling plans in response to lower prices, or increases in drilling or operating costs could result in other additional impairments. 

5.  Suspended Exploratory Well Costs    
    
  The Company s suspended exploratory well costs were   $1.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016,   and   $1.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in suspended exploratory well costs during 2016 is primarily related to the capitalization of costs associated with appraisal activities in C te d Ivoire. Projects with suspended exploratory well costs are those identified by management as exhibiting sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development or where it is reasonably possible that the well can be utilized in the development of the project and when management is actively pursuing efforts to assess whether reserves can be attributed to these projects. If additional information becomes available that raises substantial doubt as to the economic or operational viability of any of these projects, the associated costs will be expensed at that time.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   $142 million   of suspended exploratory well costs previously capitalized for greater than one year at December 31, 2015, were charged to exploration expense and primarily related to the following: 
             
    $64 million   related to a Shenandoah well in the Gulf of Mexico was expensed as it was no longer reasonably possible that the wellbore would be used in the development of the project if a final investment decision is reached 
                
    $38 million   related to the Orca-4 well in Mozambique was expensed after additional reservoir analysis and the determination that the well was not associated with the first three Orca wells 
                
    $33 million   related to the Tubar o Tigre discovery was expensed based on the outlook for development viability, given current commodity market conditions and the complexity introduced by the depth and characteristics of the reservoir 
       
  Costs of   $21 million   previously capitalized for less than one year at December 31, 2015, related to the Tubar o Tigre discovery discussed above, were also charged to exploration expense.

6.  Derivative Instruments    
    
  Objective and Strategy    The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to cash-flow variability from commodity-price and interest-rate risks. Futures, swaps, and options are used to manage exposure to commodity-price risk inherent in the Company s oil and natural-gas production and natural-gas processing operations (Oil and Natural-Gas Production/Processing Derivative Activities). Futures contracts and commodity-price swap agreements are used to fix the price of expected future oil and natural-gas sales at major industry trading locations such as Cushing, Oklahoma or Sullom Voe, Scotland for oil and Henry Hub, Louisiana for natural gas. Basis swaps are periodically used to fix or float the price differential between product prices at one market location versus another. Options are used to establish a floor price, a ceiling price, or a floor and a ceiling price (collar) for expected future oil and natural-gas sales. Derivative instruments are also used to manage commodity-price risk inherent in customer price requirements and to fix margins on the future sale of natural gas and NGLs from the Company s leased storage facilities (Marketing and Trading Derivative Activities). 
  Interest-rate swaps are used to fix or float interest rates on existing or anticipated indebtedness. The purpose of these instruments is to manage the Company s existing or anticipated exposure to interest-rate changes. The fair value of the Company s current interest-rate swap portfolio is subject to changes in interest rates. 
  The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments. As a result, gains and losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings. Net derivative losses attributable to derivatives previously subject to hedge accounting reside in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the transactions to which the derivatives relate are recognized in earnings. See    Note 15 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)   .

  Oil and Natural-Gas Production/Processing Derivative Activities    The oil prices listed below are a combination of New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate and Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE) Brent Blend prices. The natural-gas prices listed below are NYMEX Henry Hub prices. The NGLs prices listed below are Oil Price Information Services prices. The following is a summary of the Company s derivative instruments related to oil and natural-gas production/processing derivative activities at   September 30, 2016  :

  A three-way collar is a combination of three options: a sold call, a purchased put, and a sold put. The sold call establishes the maximum price that the Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes. The purchased put establishes the minimum price that the Company will receive for the contracted volumes unless the market price for the commodity falls below the sold put strike price, at which point the minimum price equals the reference price (e.g., NYMEX) plus the excess of the purchased put strike price over the sold put strike price. 
    
  Marketing and Trading Derivative Activities    The Company had financial derivative transactions with notional volumes of natural gas totaling   5   billion cubic feet (Bcf) at   September 30, 2016  , and   8   Bcf at   December 31, 2015  , that were entered into to mitigate commodity-price risk related to fixed-price purchase and sales contracts and storage activity.

6.  Derivative Instruments   (Continued) 
    
  Interest-Rate Derivatives    Anadarko has outstanding interest-rate swap contracts to manage interest-rate risk associated with anticipated debt issuances. The Company has locked in a fixed interest rate in exchange for a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In February 2016, in exchange for amended terms with certain counterparties, the Company modified the mandatory termination dates from   2021   to   2018   and, in some cases, the related fixed interest rates on interest-rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of   $500 million  . Additionally, an interest-rate swap agreement was settled for a cash payment of   $193 million   in March 2016, and interest-rate swap agreements were settled for total cash payments of   $73 million   in September 2016. Anadarko does not expect additional net cash outlays in 2016 related to interest-rate derivative settlements  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding interest-rate swaps with a notional amount of   $1.6 billion   due prior to or at September 2021 that will manage interest-rate risk associated with the potential refinancing of the Company s   $900 million   Senior Notes due 2019 and the Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due   2036   (Zero Coupons), should the Zero Coupons be put to the Company prior to the swap termination dates. None of the Zero Coupons (accreted value of   $839 million  )   were put to the Company in   October 2016  . See    Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense   . Depending on market conditions, liability-management actions, or other factors, the Company may enter into offsetting interest-rate swap positions or settle or amend certain or all of the currently outstanding interest-rate swaps.  
  Derivative settlements and collateralization are classified as cash flows from operating activities unless the derivatives contain an other-than-insignificant financing element, in which case the settlements and collateralization are classified as cash flows from financing activities. As a result of prior extensions of reference-period start dates without settlement of the related interest-rate derivative obligations, the interest-rate derivatives in the Company s portfolio contain an other-than-insignificant financing element, and therefore, any settlements or collateralization related to these extended interest-rate derivatives are classified as cash flows from financing activities. 
  The Company had the following outstanding interest-rate swaps at   September 30, 2016  :

  Credit-Risk Considerations    The financial integrity of exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to nominal credit risk, is assured by NYMEX or ICE through systems of financial safeguards and transaction guarantees. Over-the-counter traded swaps, options, and futures contracts expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties, establishes credit limits according to the Company s credit policies and guidelines, and assesses the impact on the fair value of its counterparties  creditworthiness. The Company has the ability to require cash collateral or letters of credit to mitigate its credit-risk exposure.  
  The Company has netting agreements with financial institutions that permit net settlement of gross commodity derivative assets against gross commodity derivative liabilities, and routinely exercises its contractual right to offset gains and losses when settling with derivative counterparties. In addition, the Company has setoff agreements with certain financial institutions that may be exercised in the event of default and provide for contract termination and net settlement across derivative types. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $52 million   of the Company s   $1.904 billion   gross derivative liability balance, and at   December 31, 2015  ,   $347 million   of the Company s   $1.722 billion   gross derivative liability balance, would have been eligible for setoff against the Company s gross derivative asset balance in the event of default. Other than in the event of default, the Company does not net settle across derivative types. 
  The Company s derivative instruments are subject to individually negotiated credit provisions that may require collateral of cash or letters of credit depending on the derivative s portfolio valuation versus negotiated credit thresholds. These credit thresholds may also require full or partial collateralization or immediate settlement of the Company s obligations if certain credit-risk-related provisions are triggered, such as if the Company s credit rating from major credit rating agencies declines to a level that is below investment grade. In February 2016, Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) downgraded the Company s long-term debt     credit rating from  Baa2  to  Ba1,  which is below investment grade. The downgrade triggered credit-risk-related features with certain derivative counterparties and required the Company to post collateral under its derivative instruments. During the third quarter of 2016, Anadarko paid a fee in connection with the negotiated increase of a credit threshold for an interest-rate derivative with an other-than-insignificant financing element. As a result of the increased credit threshold,   $200 million   of collateral was returned to the Company. No counterparties have requested termination or full settlement of derivative positions. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was   $1.4 billion   (net of   $422 million   of collateral) at   September 30, 2016  , and   $1.3 billion   (net of   $58 million   of collateral) at   December 31, 2015  .

6.  Derivative Instruments   (Continued) 
    
  Fair Value    Fair value of futures contracts is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, which represent Level 1 inputs. Valuations of physical-delivery purchase and sale agreements, over-the-counter financial swaps, and commodity option collars are based on similar transactions observable in active markets and industry-standard models that primarily rely on market-observable inputs. Inputs used to estimate fair value in industry-standard models are categorized as Level 2 inputs because substantially all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instruments. Inputs used to estimate the fair value of swaps and options include market-price curves; contract terms and prices; credit-risk adjustments; and, for Black-Scholes option valuations, discount factors and implied market volatility.  
  The following summarizes the fair value of the Company s derivative assets and liabilities by input level within the fair-value hierarchy:

7.  Tangible Equity Units 
    
  In June 2015, the Company issued   9.2 million     7.50%   tangible equity units (TEUs) at a stated amount of   $50.00   per TEU for net proceeds of   $445 million  . Each TEU is comprised of a prepaid equity purchase contract for common units of WGP and a senior amortizing note. Subsequent to issuance, each TEU may be legally separated into the two components. The prepaid equity purchase contract is considered a freestanding financial instrument, indexed to WGP common units, and meets the conditions for equity classification. The prepaid equity purchase contracts are included in noncontrolling interests, net of issuance costs, and the senior amortizing notes are included in short-term debt and long-term debt on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
    
  Equity Component      Unless settled earlier at the holder s option, each purchase contract has a mandatory settlement date of   June 7, 2018  . Anadarko has a right to elect to issue and deliver shares of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation common stock (APC shares) in lieu of delivering WGP common units at settlement. The Company will deliver not more than   0.8591   WGP common units and not less than   0.7159   WGP common units (or a computed number of APC shares) per TEU on the settlement date, subject to adjustment, at the settlement rate based upon the applicable market value of WGP common units (or APC shares).  
    
  Debt Component    Each senior amortizing note has an initial principal amount of   $10.95   and bears interest at   1.50%   per year. On   September 7, 2015  , Anadarko began paying equal quarterly cash installments of   $0.9375   per amortizing note (except for the September 7, 2015 installment payment, which was   $0.9063   per amortizing note). The payments constitute a payment of interest and partial repayment of principal, with the aggregate per-year payments of principal and interest equating to a   7.50%   cash payment with respect to each TEU. The senior amortizing notes have a final installment payment date of   June 7, 2018  , and are senior unsecured obligations of the Company.

  Debt Activity    The following summarizes the Company s borrowing activity, after eliminating the effect of intercompany transactions, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

__________________________________________________________________ 
            (1)   
    Excludes WES. 
               (2)

  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company used proceeds from its   $3.0 billion   March 2016 Senior Notes issuances to purchase and retire   $1.250 billion   of its   $2.0 billion     6.375%   Senior Notes due   September 2017   pursuant to a tender offer and to redeem its   $1.750 billion     5.950%   Senior Notes due   September 2016  . The Company recognized a loss of   $124 million   for the early retirement and redemption of these senior notes, which included   $114 million   of premiums paid.

  Debt    The following summarizes the Company s outstanding debt, including capital lease obligations, after eliminating the effect of intercompany transactions: 

__________________________________________________________________ 
            (1)   
    Excludes WES. 
               (2)   
    Excludes WES and WGP. 
               (3)   
    Unamortized discounts, premiums, and debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance costs related to revolving credit facilities are included in other current assets and other assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
               (4)   
    The Company s outstanding borrowings, except for borrowings under the WGP revolving credit facility, are senior unsecured. 
        
  Anadarko s Zero Coupons can be put to the Company in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons. None of the Zero Coupons (accreted value of   $839 million  ) were put to the Company in   October 2016  .  
    
  Fair Value    The Company uses a market approach to determine the fair value of its fixed-rate debt using observable market data, which results in a Level 2 fair-value measurement. The carrying amount of floating-rate debt approximates fair value as the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. The estimated fair value of the Company s total borrowings was   $17.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016,   and   $15.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .

  Anadarko Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program      Anadarko has a   $3.0 billion     five  -year senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in   January 2021   (Five-Year Facility). In addition, the Company has a   $2.0 billion     364  -day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (  364  -Day Facility) that will mature in   January 2017  . At   September 30, 2016,   the Company had   no   outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Facility or the 364-Day Facility and was in compliance with all related covenants. 
  In January 2015, the Company initiated a commercial paper program, which allows for a maximum of   $3.0 billion   of unsecured commercial paper notes and is supported by the Five-Year Facility. The maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary, but may not exceed   397 days  . In February 2016, Moody s downgraded the Company s commercial paper program credit rating, which eliminated the Company s access to the commercial paper market. The Company has not issued commercial paper notes since the downgrade and had   no   outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  WES and WGP Borrowings    In July 2016, WES completed a public offering of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of   4.650%   Senior Notes due   July 2026  . Net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under WES s   $1.2 billion     five  -year senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in   February 2019   (WES RCF), which is expandable to   $1.5 billion  . 
  At   September 30, 2016,   WES had outstanding borrowings under its RCF of   $20 million   at an interest rate of   1.82%  , had outstanding letters of credit of   $5 million  , and had available borrowing capacity of   $1.18 billion  . At   September 30, 2016,   WES was in compliance with all related covenants. 
  In March 2016, WGP entered into a   $250 million     three  -year senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in   March 2019   (WGP RCF), which is expandable to   $500 million  , subject to receiving increased or new commitments from lenders and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. Obligations under the WGP RCF are secured by a first priority lien on all of WGP s assets (not including the consolidated assets of WES), as well as all equity interests owned by WGP. Borrowings under the WGP RCF bear interest at LIBOR (with a floor of   0%  ), plus applicable margins ranging from   2.00%   to   2.75%   depending on WGP s consolidated leverage ratio, or at a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus   0.50%  , or (iii) LIBOR plus   1.00%  , in each case plus applicable margins ranging from   1.00%   to   1.75%   based upon WGP s consolidated leverage ratio. At   September 30, 2016,   WGP had outstanding borrowings under its RCF of   $28 million   at an interest rate of   2.53%  , had available borrowing capacity of   $222 million  , and was in compliance with all related covenants. 
  In October 2016, WES completed a public offering of   $200 million   aggregate principal amount of   5.450%   Senior Notes due   April 2044  . Net proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under the WES RCF and the remaining proceeds will be used for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures.

8.  Debt and Interest Expense   (Continued) 
    
  Capital Lease Obligations      Construction of a floating production, storage and offloading unit (FPSO) for the Company s Tweneboa/Enyenra/Ntomme (TEN) field operations in Ghana commenced in 2013. The Company recognized an asset and related obligation for its approximate   19%   nonoperated working interest share during the construction period. Upon completion of the construction during the third quarter of 2016, the Company reported the asset and related obligation as a capital lease of   $225 million   for the Company s share of the fair value of the FPSO. The FPSO lease provides for an initial term of   10 years   with annual renewal periods for an additional   10 years  , annual purchase options that decrease over time, and no residual value guarantees. The capital lease asset will be depreciated over the estimated proved reserves of the TEN field using the unit-of-production method, with the associated depreciation included in depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD A) in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income. The capital lease obligation will be accreted to the present value of the minimum lease payments using the effective interest method. The Company will make the first payment under the FPSO capital lease in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  At   September 30, 2016,   future minimum lease payments due under capital leases were:

9.  Income Taxes    
    
  The following summarizes income tax expense (benefit) and effective tax rates: 

The Company reported a loss before income taxes for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . As a result, items that ordinarily increase or decrease the tax rate will have the opposite effect. The decrease from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily attributable to the following decreases:  
             
    non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax for Algerian income tax purposes 
                
    tax impact from foreign operations 
                
    non-deductible goodwill related to divestitures 
                
    adjustments to deferred tax balances

10.  Conveyance of Future Hard Minerals Royalty Revenues    
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company conveyed a limited-term nonparticipating royalty interest in certain of its coal and trona leases to a third party for   $413 million  , net of transaction costs. Such conveyance entitles the third party to receive up to   $553 million   in future royalty revenue over a period of not less than   10   years and not greater than   15   years. Additionally, such third party is entitled to receive   3%   of the aggregate royalties earned during the first   10   years between   $800 million   and   $900 million   and   4%   of the aggregate royalties earned during the first   10   years that exceed   $900 million  . Generally, such third party relies solely on the royalty payments to recover its investment and, as such, has the risk of the royalties not being sufficient to recover its investment over the term of the conveyance. 
  Proceeds from this transaction were accounted for as deferred revenues and are included in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred revenues will be amortized to other revenues, included in gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net on a unit-of-revenue basis over the term of the agreement. Net proceeds received from the third party were reported in financing activities on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Semi-annual payments to the third party are scheduled on March 1 and September 1 of each year through March 1, 2026. The specified future amounts that the Company expects to pay and the payment timing are subject to change based upon the actual royalties received by the Company during the term of the conveyance. Royalties received by Anadarko under this agreement are reported in operating activities on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The semi-annual payments to the third party, up to the aggregate amount of the   $413 million   net proceeds the Company received for the conveyance in the first quarter of 2016, are reported in financing activities on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Any additional payments to the third party are reported in operating activities on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to offset the royalties received.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company amortized   $27 million   of deferred revenues as a result of this agreement. The Company made the first semi-annual payment of   $25 million   for royalties in September 2016. The following summarizes the remaining amounts that the Company expects to pay, prior to the potential 3% to 4% of any excess described above:

11.  Contingencies    
    
  Litigation    The following is a discussion of any material developments in previously reported contingencies and any other material matters that have arisen since the filing of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Deepwater Horizon Events    In April 2010, the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico blew out and an explosion occurred on the   Deepwater Horizon   drilling rig, resulting in an oil spill. The well was operated by BP Exploration and Production Inc. (BP) and Anadarko held a   25%   nonoperated interest. In October 2011, the Company and BP entered into a settlement agreement relating to the Deepwater Horizon events (Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against all claims and damages arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), claims for natural resource damages (NRD) and assessment costs, and any claims arising under the Operating Agreement with BP.  
  Numerous Deepwater Horizon event-related civil lawsuits were filed against BP and other parties, including the Company. Generally, the plaintiffs sought actual damages, punitive damages, declaratory judgment, and/or injunctive relief. This litigation was consolidated into a federal Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) action pending before Judge Carl Barbier in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans, Louisiana (Louisiana District Court). 
    
  BP Consent Decree    In July 2015, BP announced a settlement agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain states and local government entities regarding essentially all of the outstanding claims against BP related to the Deepwater Horizon event (BP Settlement) and, in October 2015, lodged a proposed consent decree with the Louisiana District Court. In April 2016, the Louisiana District Court approved the consent decree. As a result of the BP Settlement and approval of the consent decree, all liability relating to OPA-related environmental costs was resolved and all NRD claims and claims by the United States and the Gulf states impacted by the event relating to the MDL action were dismissed. For any remaining claims relating to the MDL action, the Company is fully indemnified by BP against any losses pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. For additional disclosure related to the Deepwater Horizon events, see   Note 15     Contingencies     Deepwater Horizon Events   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Penalties and Fines    In December 2010, the DOJ, on behalf of the United States, filed a civil lawsuit in the Louisiana District Court against several parties, including the Company, seeking an assessment of civil penalties under the Clean Water Act (CWA) in an amount to be determined by the Louisiana District Court. After previously finding that Anadarko, as a nonoperating investor in the Macondo well, was not culpable with respect to the Deepwater Horizon events, the Louisiana District Court found Anadarko liable for civil penalties under Section 311 of the CWA as a working-interest owner in the Macondo well and entered a judgment of   $159.5 million   in December 2015. Neither party appealed the decision and the Company paid the penalty in the first quarter of 2016.

12.  Restructuring Charges    
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company initiated a workforce reduction program to align the size and composition of its workforce with its expected future operating and capital plans. Employee notifications related to the workforce reduction program were completed by June 30, 2016. All restructuring charges will be recognized in 2016, with the exception of approximately   $17 million   of expense for retirement benefits expected to be recognized in 2017. The following summarizes the total expected restructuring charges and the amounts expensed during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,   which are included in general and administrative expenses in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income:

13.  Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits    
    
  The Company has contributory and non-contributory defined-benefit pension plans, which include both qualified and supplemental plans. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Retiree health care benefits are funded by contributions from the retiree and, in certain circumstances, contributions from the Company. The Company s retiree life insurance plan is noncontributory. The following summarizes the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit cost: 

The Company s workforce reduction program resulted in remeasurements of its pension and other postretirement plans during 2016. The remeasurements of the benefit obligation and plan assets resulted in a net liability increase of   $327 million   for the pension benefit plans and   $24 million   for the other postretirement benefit plans, with a corresponding decrease in other comprehensive income.  
  At December 31, 2015, total expected contributions related to unfunded pension plans were   $25 million   for 2016. The Company expects to contribute an additional   $82 million   in 2016 and   $23 million   in 2017 to unfunded pension plans primarily related to the workforce reduction program. See    Note 12 Restructuring Charges   .

14.  Stockholders  Equity    
    
  Common Stock Issuance    In September 2016, the Company completed a public offering of   40.5 million   shares of its common stock at a price of   $53.23   per share. Net proceeds of   $2.16 billion   from this equity issuance will primarily be used to fund the acquisition of certain Gulf of Mexico assets, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. See    Note 3 Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale   . 
    
  Earnings per Share (EPS)    The Company s basic EPS is computed based on the average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period and includes the effect of any participating securities and TEUs as appropriate. Diluted EPS includes the effect of the Company s outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, TEUs, and WES Series A Preferred units, if the inclusion of these items is dilutive. 
  The following provides a reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders:

  The following summarizes the after-tax changes in the balances of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): 

16.  Noncontrolling Interests    
    
  WES, a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary, is a limited partnership formed by Anadarko to acquire, own, develop, and operate midstream assets. During the first quarter of   2016  , WES issued   14 million   Series A Preferred units to private investors for net proceeds of   $440 million  , and issued   1.3 million   common units to the Company. Proceeds from these issuances were used to acquire interests in Springfield Pipeline LLC from the Company. During the second quarter of   2016  , WES issued an additional   eight million   Series A Preferred units to private investors, pursuant to the full exercise of an option granted in connection with the initial issuance, and raised net proceeds of   $247 million  .  
  Class C units issued to Anadarko will receive quarterly distributions in the form of additional Class C units until the end of 2017, unless WES elects to convert the units to common units earlier or Anadarko elects to extend the conversion date. WES distributed   749 thousand   Class C units to Anadarko during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   498 thousand   Class C units to Anadarko during 2015. During 2015, WES issued approximately   874 thousand   common units to the public for net proceeds of   $57 million  .  
  WGP, a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary, is a limited partnership formed by Anadarko to own partnership interests in WES. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, Anadarko sold   12.5 million   of its WGP common units to the public for net proceeds of   $476 million  .     At   September 30, 2016  , Anadarko s ownership interest in WGP consisted of an   81.6%   limited partner interest and the entire non-economic general partner interest. The remaining   18.4%   limited partner interest in WGP was owned by the public. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , WGP s ownership interest in WES consisted of a   30.0%   limited partner interest, the entire   1.5%   general partner interest, and all of the WES incentive distribution rights. At   September 30, 2016  , Anadarko also owned an   8.5%   limited partner interest in WES through other subsidiaries  ownership of common and Class C units. The remaining   60.0%   limited partner interest in WES was owned by the public.

17.  Variable Interest Entities    
    
  Consolidated VIEs    The Company determined that the partners in WGP and WES with equity at risk lack the power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact WGP s and WES s economic performance; therefore, WGP and WES are considered VIEs. Anadarko, through its ownership of the general partner interest in WGP, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to WGP and WES, therefore Anadarko is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates WGP and WES. See    Note 16 Noncontrolling Interests      for additional information on WGP and WES.  
    
  Assets and Liabilities of VIEs      The assets of WGP and WES cannot be used by Anadarko for general corporate purposes and are both included in and disclosed parenthetically on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying amounts of liabilities related to WGP and WES for which the creditors do not have recourse to other assets of the Company are both included in and disclosed parenthetically on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  All outstanding debt for WES at   September 30, 2016,   and   December 31, 2015  , including any borrowings under the WES RCF, is recourse to WES s general partner, which in turn has been indemnified in certain circumstances by certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company for such liabilities. All outstanding debt for WGP at   September 30, 2016,   and   December 31, 2015  , including any borrowings under the WGP RCF, is recourse to WGP s general partner, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. See    Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense    for additional information on WGP and WES long-term debt balances.  
    
  VIE Financing    WGP s sources of liquidity include borrowings under its RCF and distributions from WES. WES s sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operations, interest income from a note receivable from Anadarko as discussed below, borrowings under its RCF, the issuance of additional partnership units, or debt offerings. See    Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense      and      Note 16 Noncontrolling Interests      for additional information on WGP and WES financing activity.    
    
  Financial Support Provided to VIEs    Concurrent with the closing of its May 2008 initial public offering, WES loaned the Company   $260 million   in exchange for a   30  -year note bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of   6.50%  , payable quarterly. The related interest income for WES was   $5 million   for each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $13 million   for each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The note receivable and related interest income are eliminated in consolidation.  
  In March 2015, WES acquired the Company s interest in Delaware Basin JV Gathering LLC (DBJV). The acquisition was financed using a deferred purchase price obligation which requires a cash payment from WES to the Company due on March 31, 2020. The cash payment due to the Company is equal to WES s share in DBJV Net Earnings (defined below) for 2018 and 2019 less WES s share of capital expenditures incurred for DBJV from March 1, 2015 to February 29, 2020. Net Earnings is defined as all revenues less cost of product, operating expenses, and property taxes. The net present value of this obligation was   $16 million   at   September 30, 2016,   and   $189 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The reduction in the value of the deferred purchase price obligation was primarily due to revisions reflecting a decrease in WES s estimate of future Net Earnings and an increase in WES s estimate of capital expenditures to be incurred by DBJV. 
  In order to reduce WES s exposure to a majority of the commodity-price risk inherent in certain of their contracts, Anadarko has commodity price swap agreements in place with WES expiring on December 31, 2016. WES has recorded a capital contribution from Anadarko in its Consolidated Statement of Equity and Partners  Capital for the amount by which the swap price exceeds the applicable market price. WES recorded a   $35 million   capital contribution from Anadarko for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and a capital contribution of   $8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

               (3)   
    Upon completion of the FPSO during the third quarter of 2016, the Company reported the construction period obligation as a capital lease obligation and recorded a fair-value adjustment. See    Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense   . 

19.  Segment Information 
    
  Anadarko s business segments are separately managed due to distinct operational differences and unique technology, distribution, and marketing requirements. The Company s   three   reporting segments are oil and gas exploration and production, midstream, and marketing. The oil and gas exploration and production segment explores for and produces oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs and plans for the development and operation of the Company s LNG project in Mozambique. The midstream segment engages in gathering, processing, treating, and transporting Anadarko and third-party oil, condensate, natural-gas, and NGLs production. The midstream reporting segment consists of   two   operating segments, WES and other midstream, which are aggregated into one reporting segment due to similar financial and operating characteristics. The marketing segment sells much of Anadarko s oil, condensate, natural-gas, and NGLs production as well as third-party purchased volumes.

19.  Segment Information   (Continued) 
    
  To assess the performance of Anadarko s operating segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as income (loss) before income taxes; gains (losses) on divestitures, net; exploration expense; DD  impairments; interest expense; total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives; and certain items not related to the Company s normal operations, less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. During the periods presented, items not related to the Company s normal operations included restructuring charges related to the workforce reduction program included in general and administrative expenses, Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs included in other operating expenses, loss on early extinguishment of debt, Tronox-related contingent loss, and certain other nonoperating items included in other (income) expense, net. The Company s definition of Adjusted EBITDAX excludes gains (losses) on divestitures, net and exploration expense as they are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD A and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarko s financing methods or capital structure. Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX because these (gains) losses are not considered a measure of asset operating performance. Finally, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is excluded from the Company s measure of Adjusted EBITDAX because it represents earnings that are not attributable to the Company s common stockholders.  
  Management believes Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Company s operating and financial performance across periods. Adjusted EBITDAX as defined by Anadarko may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures, such as operating income. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) before income taxes:

OUTLOOK 
    
  The Company s revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital spending, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the global commodity-price markets, which affect the value the Company receives from its sales of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. During 2015, the oil and natural-gas industry experienced a significant decrease in commodity prices, which continued into 2016, driven by a global supply/demand imbalance for oil and an oversupply of natural gas in the United States. 
  The following actions in 2016 have enabled the Company to manage through this lower commodity-price environment: 
             
    reducing capital expenditures by 50% from the prior year 
                
    enhancing operational efficiencies 
                
    continuing an active monetization program by closing monetizations totaling $2.8 billion through September 30, 2016, and entering into agreements for an additional $1.2 billion, which are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016  
                
    improving the Company s cost structure by approximately $800 million annually after 2016 through a dividend decrease and a workforce reduction program 
                
    retiring approximately $3.0 billion of near-term maturities with proceeds from debt issued during the first quarter of 2016 
       
  In addition, in September 2016 the Company entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets in the Gulf of Mexico for   $2.0 billion  . The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is subject to customary closing conditions. The acquisition of these assets will expand Anadarko s operated infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, doubling the Company s ownership in the Lucius development to approximately 49% and increasing its oil production from the Gulf of Mexico. The acquired assets are expected to generate substantial cash flow over the next five years at current strip prices, enabling accelerated investment in Anadarko s Delaware and DJ basin assets. The Company completed a public offering of   40.5 million   shares of its common stock for net proceeds of   $2.16 billion   to fund the acquisition of the Gulf of Mexico assets. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. 
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

The Company has increased the estimate for its 2016 capital spending from a range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion, including approximately $490 million to $530 million for Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary, and excluding any acquisitions made by Anadarko or WES. The increase primarily reflects increased activity in the Delaware and DJ basins. The Company has currently allocated approximately 65% of its 2016 capital spending budget to development activities, 15% to exploration activities, and 20% to gathering and processing activities and other business activities. The Company currently expects its 2016 capital spending by area to be approximately 40% for the U.S. onshore region and Alaska, 20% for the Gulf of Mexico, 20% for Midstream and other (including WES), and 20% for International. 
    
  Liquidity    As of   September 30, 2016  , Anadarko had   $4.0 billion   of cash on hand plus $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities. Cash on hand includes net proceeds of   $2.16 billion   from the Company s September 2016 public offering of   40.5 million   shares of its common stock. Additionally, Anadarko has entered into divestiture agreements that are expected to close in the fourth quarter for approximately $1.2 billion. Prior to year-end 2016, Anadarko plans to use approximately $1.8 billion of its cash on hand for the acquisition of certain Gulf of Mexico assets. In October 2016, the Company provided notice of its intent to redeem its remaining $750 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due September 2017 prior to year end. Anadarko believes that its cash on hand, anticipated operating cash flows, and proceeds from expected future asset monetizations will be sufficient to fund the Company s projected 2016 operational and capital programs, the acquisition of certain assets in the Gulf of Mexico, and the redemption of its $750 million 2017 debt maturities in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  Anadarko enters into strategic derivative positions to reduce its commodity-price risk and increase the predictability of cash flows. At   September 30, 2016  , derivative positions covered   26%   of Anadarko s anticipated oil sales volumes for 2016,   42%   of its anticipated natural-gas sales volumes and   2%   of its anticipated NGLs sales volumes for 2017, and   14%   of its anticipated natural-gas sales volumes for 2018. These instruments had a fair value of   $41 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . See    Note 6 Derivative Instruments    in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Potential for Future Impairments    Properties and equipment are reviewed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that net book values may not be recoverable. In performing this review, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows from other assets. If the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the net book value of the property, the property s fair value is estimated and an impairment loss is recognized for the excess, if any, of the property s net book value over its estimated fair value. The primary assumptions used to estimate expected undiscounted future net cash flows include anticipated future production, commodity prices, and capital and operating costs. Unfavorable changes in any of these assumptions could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate property impairment. Uncertainties related to the primary assumptions could affect the timing of an impairment. In most cases, the assumption that generates the most variability in undiscounted future net cash flows is future oil and gas prices. For impairment testing, the Company used the five-year forward strip prices for oil and natural gas, with prices subsequent to the fifth year held constant as the benchmark price in the undiscounted future net cash flows. Capital and operating costs were estimated assuming 0% escalation for years where the average oil strip price was below $50 per barrel (Bbl) and 1% escalation for years where the average oil strip price exceeded $50 per Bbl. 
  At September 30, 2016, the Company s estimates of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a certain international asset group with a net book value of approximately   $1.4 billion  , and certain U.S. onshore asset groups with a combined net book value of approximately $1.1 billion, indicated that the carrying amounts were expected to be recovered; however, these asset groups may be at risk for impairment if the estimates of future cash flows decline. The Company estimates that a   10%   decline in oil prices (with all other assumptions unchanged) could result in a non-cash impairment in excess of   $600 million   for the international asset group, and a   10%   decline in natural-gas prices (with all other assumptions unchanged) could result in non-cash impairments in excess of $400 million for the U.S. onshore asset groups. It is also reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, further changes to the Company s drilling plans in response to lower prices, or increases in drilling or operating costs could result in other additional impairments.

OVERVIEW 
    
  Anadarko is among the world s largest independent exploration and production companies. Anadarko is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and marketing of oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs, and in the marketing of anticipated production of liquefied natural gas. The Company also engages in the gathering, processing, treating, and transporting of oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs. The Company has exploration and production activities in various countries around the world, including activities in the United States, Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia, C te d Ivoire, and other countries. 
    
  Significant operating and financial activities for the   third   quarter of   2016   include the following: 
    
  Overall 
             
    Anadarko s   third  -quarter sales volumes averaged   780   thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), representing a   1%     decrease   from the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily due to divestitures of U.S. onshore assets partially offset by increased performance and continued field development in U.S. onshore and new wells coming online in the Gulf of Mexico. 
                
    In September 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets in the Gulf of Mexico for   $2.0 billion  . The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is subject to customary closing conditions. 
                
    The Company closed $2.8 billion of monetizations year to date, including asset divestitures, the sale of Anadarko s interest in Springfield Pipeline LLC to WES, the sale of a portion of the Company s common units in Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP) to the public, and the Company s conveyance of a limited-term nonparticipating royalty interest in certain of its coal and trona leases to a third party. 
     U.S. Onshore 
             
    Third-quarter   liquids sales volumes averaged   284   thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d), representing a   2%     increase   from the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily due to increased performance in the DJ basin and continued field development in the Delaware basin. 
                
    Third-quarter   natural-gas sales volumes averaged   321   MBOE/d, representing a   5%     decrease   from the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily due to the September 2015 sale of certain coalbed methane properties, the July 2015 sale of certain properties in East Texas, and the June 2016 sale of certain Wyoming assets. These decreases were partially offset by improved well performance in the DJ basin and production modulation in the Marcellus shale in 2015. 
     Gulf of Mexico 
             
    Third-quarter   oil sales volumes averaged   65   MBOE/d, representing an   18%   increase from the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily due to new wells coming online at K2 and Caesar/Tonga. 
                
    The Company acquired a 33% operated working interest in the Constellation discovery (formerly Hopkins). The field is expected to be tied back to Anadarko s Constitution spar. 
     International 
             
    Third-quarter   sales volumes averaged   91   MBbls/d, representing an   11%     increase   from the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily as a result of timing of liftings in Algeria. 
                
    The Tweneboa/Enyenra/Ntomme (TEN) development project (19% nonoperated working interest) in Ghana achieved first oil in the third quarter of 2016.

Financial 
             
    Anadarko s net loss attributable to common stockholders for the   third   quarter of   2016   totaled   $830 million  . 
                
    The Company completed a public offering of   40.5 million   shares of its common stock for net proceeds of   $2.16 billion  . Net proceeds will primarily be used to fund the acquisition of certain Gulf of Mexico assets discussed above, and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. 
                
    The Company generated   $785 million   of cash flow from operations and ended the third quarter with   $4.0 billion   of cash on hand, which included net proceeds from the Company s September 2016 equity offering. 
                
    The Company recognized workforce reduction program expenses of   $112 million   in the   third   quarter for a total of   $363 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Total program expenses are expected to be   $410 million  . 
                
    WES completed a public offering of   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of   4.650%   Senior Notes due   July 2026  . Net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under WES s   $1.2 billion     five  -year senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in   February 2019   (WES RCF). 
                
    In October 2016, WES completed a public offering of   $200 million   aggregate principal amount of   5.450%   Senior Notes due   April 2044  . Net proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under the WES RCF and the remaining proceeds will be used for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 

The Company reported a loss before income taxes for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . As a result, items that ordinarily increase or decrease the tax rate will have the opposite effect. The decrease from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily attributable to the following decreases:  
             
    non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax for Algerian income tax purposes 
                
    tax impact from foreign operations

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overview    As of   September 30, 2016  , Anadarko had   $4.0 billion   of cash on hand plus $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities. Cash on hand includes net proceeds of   $2.16 billion   from the Company s September 2016 public offering of   40.5 million   shares of its common stock. Additionally, Anadarko has entered into divestiture agreements that are expected to close in the fourth quarter for approximately $1.2 billion. Prior to year-end 2016, Anadarko plans to use approximately $1.8 billion of its cash on hand for the acquisition of certain Gulf of Mexico assets. In October 2016, the Company provided notice of its intent to redeem its remaining $750 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due September 2017 prior to year end.  
  Anadarko believes that its cash on hand, anticipated operating cash flows, and proceeds from expected future asset monetizations will be sufficient to fund the Company s projected 2016 operational and capital programs, the acquisition of certain assets in the Gulf of Mexico, and the redemption of its $750 million 2017 debt maturities in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, the Company has available borrowing capacity to supplement its working capital needs. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. Anadarko has a variety of funding sources available, including cash on hand, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity, opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements that reduce future capital expenditures, and the Company s credit facilities. In addition, an effective registration statement is available to Anadarko covering the sale of WGP common units owned by the Company. 
    
  Effects of Moody s Credit Rating Downgrade    In February 2016, Standard and Poor s (S P) affirmed Anadarko s  BBB  long-term debt credit rating and changed the outlook from stable to negative. Later in February 2016, Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) lowered the Company s long-term debt credit rating from  Baa2  to  Ba1,  which is below investment grade. In March 2016, Fitch Ratings affirmed Anadarko s  BBB  long-term debt credit rating and changed the outlook from stable to negative. In September 2016, S P and Moody s changed the outlook from negative to stable. 
  As a result of Moody s downgrade of Anadarko s credit rating to a level that is below investment grade, the Company s credit thresholds with certain derivative counterparties were reduced and in some cases eliminated, which required the Company to increase the amount of collateral posted with derivative counterparties when the Company s net trading position is a liability in excess of the contractual threshold. During the third quarter of 2016, Anadarko paid a fee in connection with the negotiated increase of a credit threshold for an interest-rate derivative with an other-than-insignificant financing element. As a result of the increased credit threshold,   $200 million   of collateral was returned to the Company. No counterparties have requested termination or full settlement of derivative positions. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was   $1.4 billion   (net of   $422 million   of collateral) at   September 30, 2016  , and   $1.3 billion   (net of   $58 million   of collateral) at December 31, 2015. 
  The Moody s credit rating downgrade required Anadarko to post collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash as financial assurance of its performance under certain contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts and oil and gas sales contracts. The amount of letters of credit or cash provided as assurance of the Company s performance under these types of contractual arrangements with respect to credit-risk-related contingent features was   $274 million   at   September 30, 2016,   and   zero   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Also in February 2016, Moody s downgraded Anadarko s commercial paper program credit rating, which eliminated the Company s access to the commercial paper market. The Company has not issued commercial paper notes since the downgrade, but instead has used its   364  -day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (  364  -Day Facility) for short-term working capital requirements, as needed.

Operating Activities 
    
  One of the primary sources of variability in the Company s cash flows from operating activities is the fluctuation in commodity prices, the impact of which Anadarko partially mitigates by entering into commodity derivatives. Sales volume changes also impact cash flow, but historically have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko s cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by the costs related to operations and interest payments related to the Company s outstanding debt.  
  Anadarko generated   $1.9 billion   of cash from operating activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016,   which included an   $881 million   tax refund related to the income tax benefit associated with the Company s 2015 tax net operating loss carryback, the payment of $217 million related to severance costs and retirement benefits in connection with the workforce reduction program, and the $159.5 million payment of a Clean Water Act (CWA) penalty. Cash used in operating activities for the same period of   2015   was   $2.1 billion  , which included the $5.2 billion Tronox settlement payment. Excluding the impact of the tax refund, payments for the CWA penalty, severance costs and retirement benefits, and the Tronox settlement, operating cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016,   decreased by $1.7 billion primarily due to decreased sales revenues as a result of lower commodity prices. 

Investing Activities 
    
  Capital Expenditures      The following presents the Company s capital expenditures for the   nine months ended     September 30  : 

________________________________________________________________________________________ 
            (1)   
    Additions to properties and equipment as presented within Anadarko s cash flows from investing activities include cash payments for cost of properties, equipment, and facilities. The cost of properties includes the initial capitalization of drilling costs associated with all exploratory wells whether or not they were deemed to have a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves. 
               (2)   
    Includes WES capital expenditures of   $355 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016,   and   $405 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Capital expenditures exclude the FPSO capital lease asset, see Financing Activities     Capital Lease Obligations   below. 
       
  The Company s capital expenditures   decreased   by   $2.3 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as reduced development and exploration activity resulted in the following: 
             
    decreased development costs of $1.7 billion primarily in U.S. onshore  
                
    decreased exploration costs of $273 million primarily in Colombia and Mozambique  
                
    decreased gathering, processing, and other costs of $267 million primarily in U.S. onshore 
       
  Carried-Interest Arrangements      In the third quarter of 2014, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $442 million of Anadarko s capital costs in exchange for a 34% working interest in the Company s Eaglebine development, located in Southeast Texas. The third-party funding is expected to cover Anadarko s future capital costs in the development through 2020. At   September 30, 2016  , $147 million of the $442 million carry obligation had been funded. 
  In the second quarter of 2013, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $860 million of Anadarko s capital costs in exchange for a 12.75% working interest in the Heidelberg development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. At   September 30, 2016  , the entire $860 million carry obligation had been funded.

Anadarko Revolving Credit Facilities      Anadarko has a   $3.0 billion     five  -year senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in   January 2021   (Five-Year Facility) and the   364  -Day Facility that matures in   January 2017  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016,   borrowings under the 364-Day Facility were primarily used for general short-term working capital needs. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Facility or the 364-Day Facility. 
    
  WES and WGP Revolving Credit Facilities      WES has a   $1.2 billion   RCF, which is expandable to   $1.5 billion  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016,   WES borrowings were primarily used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of a portion of its acquisition of Springfield Pipeline LLC and capital expenditures. At   September 30, 2016,   WES had outstanding borrowings under its RCF of   $20 million   at an interest rate of   1.82%  , had outstanding letters of credit of   $5 million  , and had available borrowing capacity of   $1.18 billion  .  
  In March 2016, WGP entered into a   $250 million     three  -year senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in   March 2019   (WGP RCF), which is expandable to   $500 million  , subject to receiving increased or new commitments from lenders and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016,   WGP borrowings were used to fund the purchase of WES common units. At   September 30, 2016,   WGP had outstanding borrowings under its RCF of   $28 million   at an interest rate of   2.53%   and had available borrowing capacity of   $222 million  .  
  For additional information on the revolving credit facilities, such as years of maturity, interest rates, and covenants, see    Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense      in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.  
    
  Commercial Paper Program      The Company has a commercial paper program, which allows for a maximum of   $3.0 billion   of unsecured commercial paper notes and is supported by the Five-Year Facility. As a result of Moody s downgrade of Anadarko s commercial paper program credit rating, the Company s access to the commercial paper market was eliminated. The Company repaid $250 million of commercial paper notes during the first quarter of 2016, and at   September 30, 2016,   there were   no   outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program. See    Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense      in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information.  
    
  Capital Lease Obligations    Construction of the FPSO for the Company s TEN field operations in Ghana commenced in 2013. The Company recognized an asset and related obligation during the construction period. Upon completion of the construction during the third quarter of 2016, the Company reported the asset and related obligation as a capital lease of   $225 million   for the Company s share of the fair value of the FPSO. The Company expects to make the first payment related to the FPSO in the fourth quarter of 2016. At   September 30, 2016  , Anadarko s scheduled payments associated with capital lease obligations were   $16 million   during 2016 and   $42 million   during 2017. Principal payments related to capital lease obligations are reported in financing activities and interest payments related to capital lease obligations are reported in operating activities on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. See    Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense      in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information.  
    
  Debt Maturities    Anadarko may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Anadarko s scheduled debt maturities during 2016 consisted of $8 million of senior amortizing notes associated with the TEUs. At   September 30, 2016,   Anadarko s scheduled debt maturities during 2017 consisted of $34 million of senior amortizing notes associated with the TEUs and $750 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due September 2017. The Company provided notice in October 2016 of its intent to redeem the 6.375% Senior Notes due September 2017 during the fourth quarter using cash on hand. Anadarko s Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons) can be put to the Company in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons. None of the Zero Coupons (accreted value of   $839 million  ) were put to the Company in   October 2016  . The Zero Coupons can be put to the Company in October 2017, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value of   $883 million  .

Derivative Instruments    For information on derivative instruments, including cash flow treatment, see    Note 6 Derivative Instruments    in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and   Effects of Moody s Credit Rating Downgrade   above. 
    
  Conveyance of Future Hard Minerals Royalty Revenues      During the first quarter of 2016, the Company conveyed a limited-term nonparticipating royalty interest in certain of its coal and trona leases to a third party for   $413 million  , net of transaction costs. For additional information on the cash flow treatment, expected timing, and scheduled payments of the conveyed royalties, see    Note 10 Conveyance of Future Hard Minerals Royalty Revenues    in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Common Stock Dividends    Anadarko paid dividends of   $78 million   to its common stockholders during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016,   and   $415 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . In response to the commodity-price environment, in February 2016, the Board decreased the Company s quarterly dividend from $0.27 per share to $0.05 per share. Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders on a quarterly basis since becoming a public company in 1986. 
  The amount of future dividends paid to Anadarko common stockholders will be determined by the Board on a quarterly basis and is based on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements, the effect a dividend payment would have on the Company s compliance with relevant financial covenants, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. 
    
  Equity Transactions    In September 2016, Anadarko completed a public offering of   40.5 million   shares of its common stock for net proceeds of   $2.16 billion  . Net proceeds will primarily be used to fund the acquisition of certain Gulf of Mexico assets, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. 
  Anadarko sold 12.5 million of its WGP common units to the public for net proceeds of   $476 million  , which were used for general corporate purposes. WES has a continuous offering program, which allows the issuance of up to an aggregate of $500 million of WES common units. The remaining amount available to be issued under this program was $442 million at   September 30, 2016  . During the first quarter of 2016, WES issued   14 million   Series A Preferred units to private investors for net proceeds of   $440 million  . During the second quarter of 2016, WES issued an additional   eight million   Series A Preferred units to private investors, pursuant to the full exercise of an option granted in connection with the initial issuance, for net proceeds of   $247 million  . 
    
  Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners    WES distributed to its unitholders other than Anadarko and WGP an aggregate of $192 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016,   and $170 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . WES has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its initial public offering (IPO) in the second quarter of 2008, and has increased its distribution from $0.30 per common unit for the third quarter of 2008 to $0.845 per common unit for the   third   quarter of   2016   (to be paid in November 2016).  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016,   the WES Series A Preferred unitholders will receive a quarterly distribution of $0.68 per unit for the Series A Preferred units issued in March 2016 and April 2016, or an aggregate $15 million (to be paid in November 2016). For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the WES Series A Preferred unitholders received a quarterly distribution of $0.68 per unit for the Series A Preferred units issued in March 2016, and a quarterly distribution of $0.68 per unit for the Series A Preferred units issued in April 2016, prorated for the 77-day period the units were outstanding during the second quarter of 2016, or an aggregate $14 million (paid in August 2016). For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the WES Series A Preferred unitholders received a quarterly distribution of $0.68 per unit, prorated for the 18-day period the units were outstanding during the first quarter, or an aggregate $2 million (paid in May 2016). 
  WGP distributed to its unitholders other than Anadarko an aggregate of $41 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and $27 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . WGP has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its IPO in December 2012, and has increased its distribution from $0.17875 per common unit for the first quarter of 2013 to $0.44750 per unit for the   third   quarter of   2016   (to be paid in November 2016).

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  The Company s primary market risks are attributable to fluctuations in energy prices and interest rates. These risks can affect revenues and cash flows, and the Company s risk-management policies provide for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks. The types of commodity derivative instruments used by the Company include futures, swaps, options, and fixed-price physical-delivery contracts. The volume of commodity derivatives entered into by the Company is governed by risk-management policies and may vary from year to year. Both exchange and over-the-counter traded derivative instruments may be subject to margin-deposit requirements, and the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash or provide letters of credit with exchange brokers or counterparties to satisfy these margin requirements. For additional information relating to the Company s derivative and financial instruments, see    Note 6 Derivative Instruments    in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
    
  COMMODITY-PRICE RISK    The Company s most significant market risk relates to prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Management expects energy prices to remain unpredictable and potentially volatile. As energy prices decline or rise significantly, revenues and cash flows are likewise affected. In addition, a non-cash write-down of the Company s oil and gas properties or goodwill may be required if commodity prices experience a significant decline. Below is a sensitivity analysis for the Company s commodity-price-related derivative instruments. 
    
  Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes    The Company had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future production of   8   MMBbls of oil,   354   Bcf of natural gas, and   1   MMBbls of NGLs at   September 30, 2016  , with a   net derivative asset position   of   $41 million  . Based on actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase in underlying commodity prices would reduce the fair value of these derivatives by   $89 million  , while a 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices would increase the fair value of these derivatives by   $86 million  . However, any cash received or paid to settle these derivatives would be substantially offset by the sales value of production covered by the derivative instruments. 
    
  Derivative Instruments Held for Trading Purposes    At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a   net derivative asset position   of   $8 million   on outstanding derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes. Based on actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase or decrease in underlying commodity prices would not materially impact the Company s gains or losses on these derivative instruments. 
    
  INTEREST-RATE RISK    Borrowings, if any, under each of the 364-Day Facility, the Five-Year Facility, the WES RCF, and the WGP RCF are subject to variable interest rates. The balance of Anadarko s long-term debt on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets has fixed interest rates. The Company has   $2.9 billion   of obligations based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) that are presented on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets net of preferred investments in two noncontrolled entities. These obligations give rise to minimal net interest-rate risk because coupons on the related preferred investments are also LIBOR-based. While a 10% change in LIBOR would not materially impact the Company s interest cost, it would affect the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a   net derivative liability position   of   $1.8 billion   related to interest-rate swaps. A 10% increase (decrease) in the three-month LIBOR interest-rate curve would decrease (increase) the aggregate fair value of outstanding interest-rate swap agreements by   $70 million  . However, any change in the interest-rate derivative gain or loss could be substantially offset by changes in actual borrowing costs associated with future debt issuances. For a summary of the Company s outstanding interest-rate derivative positions, see    Note 6 Derivative Instruments    in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Anadarko s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer performed an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in Anadarko s internal control over financial reporting during the   third   quarter of   2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
    
  GENERAL    The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings and regulatory controls arising in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury and death claims; title disputes; tax disputes; royalty claims; contract claims; contamination claims relating to oil and gas exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing; and environmental claims, including claims involving assets owned by acquired companies and claims involving assets previously sold to third parties and no longer a part of the Company s current operations. Anadarko is also subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, after consideration of recorded expense and liability accruals, management believes that the resolution of pending proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  WGR Operating, LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is currently in negotiations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Wyoming with respect to alleged noncompliance with the leak detection and repair requirements of the Clean Air Act at its Granger, Wyoming facilities. Although management cannot predict the outcome of settlement discussions, it is likely a resolution of this matter will result in a fine or penalty in excess of $100,000. 
  See    Note 11 Contingencies    in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference, for material developments with respect to matters previously reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and material matters that have arisen since the filing of such report.  

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  Consider carefully the risk factors included below, as well as those included under Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The pending completion of the acquisition     of     certain assets in the Gulf of Mexico from an unaffiliated third party for $2.0 billion is subject to a number of conditions, and we may not be able to consummate it if such conditions are not met. 
    
  We expect to close the acquisition of certain assets in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, the completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, and we may not be able to consummate it if such conditions are not met. Upon termination of the purchase agreement for willful breach by us or failure to close as of an outside termination date, the seller has the option to receive a $100 million liquidated damages payment or seek all remedies available at law, including specific performance. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Investing Activities     Acquisition  for more information regarding the acquisition. 
    
  Risks related to the assets to be acquired in the pending Gulf of Mexico acquisition, if consummated, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
    
  Any acquisition, including the pending acquisition of certain assets in the Gulf of Mexico, involves potential risks, including, among other things:  

the validity of our assumptions about, among other things, reserves, estimated production, revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and costs; 
                
    the assumption of environmental and other unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate; 
                
    an inability to obtain satisfactory title to the assets we acquire; 
                
    the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns; 
                
    the inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets; 
     
   59 

     Table of Contents  

the incurrence of significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges; 
                
    increased cost of transportation of production to markets; 
                
    significant costs associated with the acquisition and subsequent integration efforts; and 
                
    a failure to attain or maintain compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations. 
       
  If we consummate the acquisition and if any of these risks were to materialize, the benefits of the acquisition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.  

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  The following sets forth information with respect to repurchases by the Company of its shares of common stock during the   third   quarter of   2016  :

  Dear             : 

The Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (the  Company ) has made an Award of Nonqualified Options ( Options ) to you under the Company s 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the  Plan ).

Unless defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meaning assigned to them under the Plan.  The Plan and Plan Summary are available on the Anadarko intranet website at the following address: [internal website address].    
    
  Effective [Grant Date] ( Grant Date ), you have been granted Options to buy     shares of Common Stock ( Shares ) at $      per Share.  Provided you remain employed by the Company until such dates, one-third of this Award will vest on [first anniversary of Grant Date], one-third will vest on [second anniversary of Grant Date], and the remaining one-third will vest on [third anniversary of Grant Date] (collectively, the  Vesting Schedule ).  All unexercised Options shall expire seven years from Grant Date, or on [date]. 
    
  Upon vesting, the Options may be exercised in whole or in part by notifying the Company s Stock Plan Administrator or Corporate Secretary at the Company s corporate headquarters.  Such notice shall be in the form specified by the Company.  Payments of all amounts due (e.g., Purchase Price and applicable withholding taxes) shall be made by check payable to the Company, unless the Company has provided that such amounts may be satisfied in the following manner: (i) all or a portion of the Purchase Price may be paid by delivery of Shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the date of exercise) that is equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; or (ii) you may pay the Purchase Price by authorizing a third party to sell Shares (or a sufficient portion of the Shares) acquired upon exercise of the Options and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Purchase Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise.  No Shares shall be issued or delivered until full payment of the Purchase Price and applicable withholding taxes, if any, have been made.   
  
   1 

Unexercised Options shall expire and be forfeited (without value) to the Company in the event of your termination of employment, unless otherwise provided below:  
    
  (i) Voluntary   Retirement (Other than a Qualified Retirement (defined below)  .  If your employment with the Company ceases by reason of your retirement, as defined in the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Retiree Health Benefits Plan but excluding a Qualified Retirement ( Retirement ), you may, for a period of not more than thirty-six (36) months after the date of cessation of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options if and to the extent they were exercisable on the date of Retirement.   
    
  (ii)    Qualified Retirement  .  A retirement shall be considered a  Qualified Retirement  if it occurs at or after the later of (A) 180 days following the Grant Date and (B) your attainment of the age of 60 with a minimum of 10 years of service with the Company. Years of service with the Company shall be determined from your hire date, or if you previously worked for the Company or one of its affiliates, from your most recent hire date with the Company.  If your employment with the Company ceases by reason of your Qualified Retirement, the Options shall continue to vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule. Vested Options may be exercised for a period of not more than sixty (60) months after the date of cessation of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms). 
    
  (iii)   Death  .  If your employment with the Company is terminated due to death, all outstanding Options granted to you shall vest and be immediately exercisable with respect to all or any part of the Options which remain unexercised.  Your legal representative, Beneficiary or other person or persons to whom your rights under the Options shall pass to by will or the laws of descent and distribution (collectively,  Recipient ), may, for a period of not more than thirty-six (36) months after the date of death (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options.   
    
  In the event of your death after termination of employment described in (i), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) herein, your Recipient will have the remaining exercise period awarded to you by your reason of termination as provided in this Award Agreement or the Plan.  
    
  In the event of your death after termination of employment described in (ii) herein, all outstanding Options granted to you shall vest and be immediately exercisable with respect to all or any part of the Options which remain unexercised.  Your Recipient may, for a period of not more than sixty (60) months after the date of termination of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options. 
    
  (iv)   Disability  .  If your employment with the Company is terminated due to disability (as defined in the Company s disability plan), all outstanding Options granted to you shall vest and be immediately exercisable with respect to all or any part of the Options which remain unexercised.  You may, for a period of not more than thirty-six (36) months after the date of termination of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options.   
    
  (v) Involuntary   Termination Without Cause  .  Except as provided in (vi) below,  
  
   2 

if your employment with the Company is terminated by the Company due to a reduction in force, job abolishment, or at the convenience of the Company, as determined by the Company, you may, for a period of not more than twelve (12) months after such termination of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options if and to the extent they were exercisable at the date of such termination.   
    
  (vi)   Termination following a Change of Control  .  If your employment with the Company is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, all outstanding Options granted to you shall vest and be immediately exercisable with respect to all or any part of the Options which remain unexercised and you may, for a period of not more than three (3) months after such termination of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options.

If you voluntarily terminate employment with the Company other than for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, you may, for a period of not more than three (3) months after such termination of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options if and to the extent they were exercisable at the date of such termination.  
    
  (viii)   Termination for Cause  .  If you are terminated from employment with the Company for Cause, all your Options (whether vested or unvested, exercisable or unexercisable) shall be immediately forfeited. 
    
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if your employment is terminated as provided in (v) or (vii) above and you otherwise qualify for Retirement or Qualified Retirement, you shall be deemed to have terminated employment because of Retirement or Qualified Retirement, as applicable. 
    
  For purposes of this Award Agreement, you shall be considered to be in the employment of the Company as long as you remain an employee of either the Company, a Subsidiary (determined without regard to whether the Plan Administrator has designated the entity as a Subsidiary for purposes of the Plan), or a corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such corporation assuming or substituting new options for the Options.  Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, it is expressly provided that you shall be considered to have terminated employment with the Company at the time of the termination of the  Subsidiary  status under the Plan of the entity or other organization that employs you.  Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of such employment, and the cause of such termination, shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and its determination shall be final. 
    
  Except as provided in the Plan, the Options granted hereunder are not transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Options are exercisable, during your lifetime, only by you.  Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the Options, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, contrary to the provisions hereof, or upon the levy of any attachment or similar process upon the Options or any right or  
  
   3 

privilege conferred hereby, the Options and the right and privilege conferred hereby shall immediately become null and void. 
    
  You shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to the Options prior to the date such Shares are exercised and issued to you. 
    
  If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and if you knowingly engaged in the misconduct, were grossly negligent with respect to such misconduct, or knowingly or grossly negligently failed to prevent the misconduct (whether or not you are one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), the Plan Administrator may determine that you shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award earned or accrued during the twelve-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement.   
    
  Notwithstanding anything in this Award Agreement or any other agreement between you and the Company to the contrary, including, without limitation, any provisions that prevent the Company from unilaterally amending this Award Agreement, you acknowledge that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Act ) has the effect of requiring certain officers of the Company to repay the Company, and for the Company to recoup from such officers, erroneously awarded amounts of incentive-based compensation.  If the Act, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any similar federal or state law requires the Company to recoup any erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation (including stock options and any other equity-based awards) that the Company has paid or granted to you, you hereby agree, even if you have terminated your employment with the Company, to promptly repay such erroneously awarded incentive compensation to the Company upon its written request.  This obligation shall survive the termination of this Award Agreement. 
    
  After your employment relationship with the Company terminates for any reason, you acknowledge and agree, by accepting the Award Agreement, that you remain subject to the following obligations ( Post-Termination Obligations ), which serve to align your interests with the Company s long-term business interests.  The following Post-Termination Obligations are reasonably related to the protection of such business interests, including the preservation of the Company s goodwill and the protection of the confidential information that you have obtained and will obtain in the course of your future employment with the Company.   
    
  a.     Non-Disclosure.    You will comply with the obligations contained in the Anadarko Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that continue after termination of employment to not disclose or utilize certain confidential information of the Company and its affiliates as specified therein.  As an officer of the Company, the law imposes upon you a duty to safeguard and protect confidential information of the Company and its affiliates.  Except as expressly permitted by this Award Agreement and without limiting the foregoing, you shall not use for your own benefit or the benefit of any person or entity (other than the Company and its affiliates), or disclose to any person or entity (other than  
  
   4 

the Company and its affiliates), any information relating to confidential information of the Company or its affiliates made, developed or acquired by or disclosed to you, individually or in conjunction with others, during your employment with the Company or its affiliates (whether during business hours or otherwise and whether on the Company s premises or otherwise).  The non-disclosure requirements set forth in this paragraph (a) are subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) ( Disclosures ) below. 
    
  b.    Non-Disparagement.    For a term of one (1) year beginning on the last day of your employment with the Company, you shall make no disparaging remarks regarding or relating to Anadarko, its affiliates, or any employee or director of Anadarko or its affiliates.  The non-disparagement requirements set forth in this paragraph (b) are subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) ( Disclosures ) below. 
    
  c.    Non-Solicitation.    For a term of one (1) year beginning on the last day of your employment with the Company, you will not, directly or indirectly, solicit, or otherwise attempt to induce, any employee of the Company or any of its affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Company or such affiliates, or hire or assist in the hiring of any such employee by any person, association, or entity not affiliated with the Company.   
    
  d.    Remedies.    Should you violate any Post-Termination Obligation, you will not thereafter be entitled to exercise any of the Options that have not yet been exercised (whether or not vested) and such Options shall be forfeited (without value) to the Company immediately as of the date that you violate such Post-Termination Obligation.  If your violation of any Post-Termination Obligation is not discovered until after any such Options have been exercised, the Company may require you to return to it all Shares that were the subject of such exercise, or the monetary value of such Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of a Post-Termination Obligation by you.  The Company shall be entitled as a matter of right to specific performance of the Post-Termination Obligations, including entry of an   ex parte   temporary restraining order in state or federal court, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against activities in violation of this Award Agreement, or both, or other appropriate judicial remedy, writ or order, in any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation of such agreements by you or others acting on your behalf, without any showing of irreparable harm and without any showing that the Company does not have adequate remedy at law.  The remedies specified herein shall not be construed as limiting the remedies available to the Company and shall be in addition to all other remedies available to the Company at law and in equity. If any term, provision, covenant or condition of the Post-Termination Obligations is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, unenforceable, or void, and not correctable through modification, then such provision, covenant, or condition (or portion thereof) may be severed and the validity and enforceability of the remainder of this Award Agreement shall not in any way be affected, impaired or invalidated. 
       
  e.    Disclosures  .  Nothing in this Award Agreement will prevent you from making disparaging remarks or disclosing Company confidential and proprietary information  
  
   5 

when compelled to do so by law or when such communications are intended to comply with any federal or state whistleblower statute including, but not limited to, information provided in a manner described in Section 21F(h)(1)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 78u-6(h)(1)(A).  Nothing in this Award Agreement will prevent you from: (i) making a good faith report of possible violations of applicable law to any governmental agency or entity or (ii) making disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prevent you from making a disclosure of a trade secret that: (A) is made (1) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (2) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.  Further, an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer of reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (X) files any document containing the trade secret under seal and (Y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL 
  [DATE] 
    
  Dear            :  
    
  The Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (the  Company ) has made an Award of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ) to you under the Company s 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the  Plan ).  This RSU Award is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan, the summary of the Plan (the  Plan Summary ) and the provisions of this Award Agreement.  Unless defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meaning assigned to them under the Plan.  The Plan and Plan Summary are available on the Anadarko intranet website at the following address:  [internal website address].  
    
  Effective [Grant Date] (the  Grant Date ), you have been granted an Award of        RSUs, which vest over a period of time.  Provided you remain employed by the Employer until such dates, one-third of the RSUs will vest on [first anniversary of Grant Date], one-third will vest on [second anniversary of Grant Date], and the remaining one-third will vest on [third anniversary of Grant Date] (each considered a  Vesting Period ) (collectively, the  Vesting Schedule ). 
    
  At the end of each Vesting Period, unless deferred, the number of RSUs that vest shall be converted into shares of unrestricted Common Stock and such unrestricted shares, less applicable payroll taxes withheld in the form of shares, shall be delivered to you within 30 days of the last day of the Vesting Period.  Upon receipt, you are free to sell, gift or otherwise dispose of such shares; provided that you comply with the applicable restrictions under the Company s Insider Trading Policy (including the receipt of pre-clearance) and the applicable stock ownership requirements.  
    
  Dividend equivalents (as provided in Section 11.4 of the Plan) with respect to the RSUs shall be accrued and reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock and paid, less applicable withholding taxes, at such time as the RSUs to which they relate vest and settle. The RSUs do not have voting rights.  They do, however, count toward any applicable stock ownership requirements as set forth in the Company s Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
    
  You may be allowed to make an election to defer your entire RSU Award on a separate form provided by Human Resources.  All deferral elections and distributions must be made in compliance with Section 409A. 
    
  All unvested RSUs and unpaid RSU dividend equivalents will be immediately forfeited if you incur a  separation from service  (within the meaning of such term set forth in Section 409A under such definitions and procedures as established by the Company in accordance with Section 409A) due to (i) termination for Cause or (ii) your voluntary termination of employment (including retirement as defined by the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Retiree  
  
   1 

Health Benefits Plan) other than a voluntary termination of employment due to Qualified Retirement (defined below) or for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control. 
    
  A retirement shall be considered a  Qualified Retirement  if it occurs at or after the later of (i) 180 days following the Grant Date and (ii) your attainment of the age of 60 with a minimum of 10 years of service with the Company. Years of service with the Company shall be determined from your hire date, or if you previously worked for the Company or one of its affiliates, from your most recent hire date with the Company. If you incur a separation from service by reason of your Qualified Retirement, then all unvested RSUs shall continue to vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule, together with any related RSU dividend equivalents accrued but not yet paid.  
    
  Upon your death prior to a separation from service or following a Qualified Retirement, all of your unvested RSUs will immediately vest and, together with any related RSU dividend equivalents accrued but not yet paid, will be paid within 30 days after the date of your death.   
    
  Except as provided in the following sentence, upon your separation from service due to an involuntary termination without Cause, all of your unvested RSUs held for at least 180 days since the Grant Date will immediately vest, and all of your unvested RSUs held for less than 180 days since the Grant Date will be immediately forfeited. Upon your separation from service due to (i) disability (as defined in the Company s disability plan), (ii) an involuntary termination without Cause during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control or (iii) termination of employment for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, all of your unvested RSUs will immediately vest. The RSUs vested pursuant to this paragraph, together with any related RSU dividend equivalents accrued but not yet paid, will be paid on the first business day that is at least six months and one day following the applicable separation from service (or, if earlier, within 30 days after the date of your death).   
    
  RSUs and related RSU dividend equivalents that vest in accordance with the three preceding paragraphs shall be converted into shares of unrestricted Common Stock and such unrestricted shares, less applicable payroll taxes withheld in the form of shares, shall be delivered to you at the time specified above.  However, if any taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act are first due with respect to RSUs and related dividend equivalents prior to the time of vesting provided in the preceding provisions of this Award Agreement, then you will be required to deliver to the Company at the time specified by the Company such amount of money as the Company may require to satisfy its minimum withholding obligation under applicable tax laws and regulations. 
    
  Your RSUs are subject to several restrictions, including that such RSUs may not be transferred, sold, assigned, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred or disposed of. 
    
  If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and if you knowingly engaged in the misconduct, were grossly negligent with respect to such misconduct, or knowingly or grossly negligently failed to prevent the misconduct (whether or not you are one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), the Plan Administrator may determine that you shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award earned or accrued during the twelve-month period following the first public issuance or  
  
   2 

filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement. 
    
  Notwithstanding anything in this Award Agreement or any other agreement between you and the Company to the contrary, including, without limitation, any provisions that prevent the Company from unilaterally amending this Award Agreement, you agree by accepting this Award that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Act ) has the effect of requiring certain officers of the Company to repay the Company, and for the Company to recoup from such officers, erroneously awarded amounts of incentive-based compensation.  If the Act, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any similar federal or state law requires the Company to recoup any erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation (including stock options and any other equity-based awards) that the Company has paid or granted to you, you hereby agree, even if you have terminated your employment with the Company, to promptly repay such erroneously awarded incentive compensation to the Company upon its written request.  This obligation shall survive the termination of this Award Agreement. 
    
  After your employment relationship with the Company terminates for any reason, you acknowledge and agree, by accepting the Award Agreement, that you remain subject to the following obligations ( Post-Termination Obligations ), which serve to align your interests with the Company s long-term business interests.  The following Post-Termination Obligations are reasonably related to the protection of such business interests, including the preservation of the Company s goodwill and the protection of the confidential information that you have obtained and will obtain in the course of your future employment with the Company.   
    
  a.       Non-Disclosure  .

The non-disclosure requirements set forth in this paragraph (a) are subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) ( Disclosures ) below. 
    
  b.      Non-Disparagement  .  For a term of one (1) year beginning on the last day of your employment with the Company, you shall make no disparaging remarks regarding or relating to Anadarko, its affiliates, or any employee or director of Anadarko or its affiliates.  The non-disparagement requirements set forth in this paragraph (b) are subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) ( Disclosures ) below.

   3 

her employment with the Company or such affiliates, or hire or assist in the hiring of any such employee by any person, association, or entity not affiliated with the Company.   
    
  d.      Remedies  .  Should you violate any Post-Termination Obligation, you will not thereafter be entitled to payment with respect to any of the Awards subject to this Award Agreement that have not yet vested, and such Awards shall be forfeited (without value) to the Company immediately as of the date that you violate such Post-Termination Obligation.  If your violation of any Post-Termination Obligation is not discovered until after any such Award has vested and been conveyed to you, the Company may require you to return to it all Shares that were the subject of such Award (determined prior to the application of any applicable tax withholding), or the monetary value of such Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of a Post-Termination Obligation by you.  The Company shall be entitled as a matter of right to specific performance of the Post-Termination Obligations, including entry of an ex parte temporary restraining order in state or federal court, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against activities in violation of this Award Agreement, or both, or other appropriate judicial remedy, writ or order, in any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation of such agreements by you or others acting on your behalf, without any showing of irreparable harm and without any showing that the Company does not have adequate remedy at law.

The value of these PUs, if any, will be dependent upon the Company s relative total stockholder return ( TSR ) over the specified three-year performance period that begins [date] and ends [date] (the  Performance Period ). At the end of the Performance Period, your Target will vest. The maximum number of PUs that you can earn during the Performance Period will be calculated as follows {     x  200%}  ,   with actual payout based on the Company s TSR ranking as described below.  
    
  Each PU represents the value of one share of the Company s Common Stock. The payout of PUs is contingent upon the Company s TSR ranking relative to a predetermined peer group during the Performance Period. The TSR measure provides an external comparison of the Company s performance against a peer group of companies and will be calculated as follows: 
    
  Average Closing Stock Price for the last 30 trading days of the Performance Period 
    
  Minus 
    
  Average Closing Stock Price for the 30 trading days preceding the beginning of the Performance Period 
    
  Plus 
    
  Dividends paid per share over the Performance Period (based on ex-dividend date) 
    
  Total Above Divided By 
    
  Average Closing Stock Price for the 30 trading days preceding the beginning of the Performance Period 
  The actual number of PUs you will earn for the Performance Period is based upon the Company s relative TSR ranking as follows: 
  
   1 

For example, if you were awarded 1,000 target PUs and the Company s relative ranking for the  Performance Period is 3   rd   , you will receive 1,640 PUs (1,000 x 164%) at the end of the Performance Period (subject to the other terms and conditions of this Award Agreement).  
    
  The peer group for the Performance Period includes Apache Corporation, Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., Hess Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, Noble Energy, Inc., Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Pioneer Natural Resources Company.  If, during the Performance Period, any peer company undergoes a change in corporate capitalization or a corporate transaction (including, but not limited to, a going private transaction, bankruptcy, liquidation, merger, consolidation, etc.), then the Committee shall undertake an evaluation to determine whether such peer company will be replaced with a different peer company (any such replacement company shall be identified pursuant to the rules established by the Committee with respect to, and in no event after, the first 90 days of the Performance Period).  The Committee has designated Southwestern Energy, Inc.; Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation; Concho Resources, Inc.; and Cimarex Energy as replacement companies, in this respective order.   
    
  After the end of the Performance Period, the value attributed to the PUs that are earned on such date shall be calculated by multiplying the number of PUs earned by the Fair Market Value of the Company s Common Stock on the day the Committee certifies the performance results and approves the payouts. This value shall be reduced by the applicable payroll taxes as a result of the vesting of the PUs earned, and the resulting amount shall then be paid to you in cash within 60 days after the end of the Performance Period (unless subject to a properly executed deferral election).     
    
  Dividend equivalents (as described in Section 9.5 of the Plan) shall not be paid with respect to the PUs (subject to the provisions below regarding payouts following the occurrence of a Change of Control). The PUs do not have voting rights and the PUs do not count toward any applicable stock ownership guidelines.    
    
  You may be allowed to make an election to defer your entire PU Award on a separate form provided by Human Resources. All deferral elections and distributions must be made in compliance with Section 409A.

If (i) you incur a  separation from service  (within the meaning of such term set forth in Section 409A under such definitions and procedures as established by the Company in accordance with Section 409A) due to your voluntary termination of employment other than for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control and other than by reason of Retirement or Qualified Retirement (each as defined below), or (ii) you incur a separation from service due to a termination for Cause, then, in each case, all unvested PUs will be immediately forfeited as of the date of your separation from service. 
    
  Upon your death (either prior to a separation from service or after Retirement or Qualified Retirement) and prior to the end of the Performance Period, all of your then outstanding and unvested PUs will become immediately vested and paid within 60 days after the date of your death in an amount equal to your Target multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the Company s Common Stock as of the date of your death; provided, however, that if your death occurs on or after the date upon which a Change of Control occurs, then the amount payable upon your death shall be determined as provided below with respect to PUs that are outstanding on the date upon which a Change of Control occurs. Solely in the case of Retirement (but not in the case of Qualified Retirement), such payout shall be prorated based on the number of months you worked during the Performance Period. 
    
  If you incur a separation from service prior to the end of the Performance Period due to (i) disability (as defined in the Company s disability plan) or (ii) involuntary termination without Cause or termination for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, then you will receive a payout within 60 days after the end of the Performance Period. The amount of such payout shall be based on actual performance at the end of the Performance Period; provided, however, that if a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, then such payout shall be determined as provided below with respect to PUs that are outstanding on the date upon which a Change of Control occurs.   
    
  If you incur a separation from service prior to the end of the Performance Period due to (i)  Retirement  (as defined by the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Retiree Health Benefits Plan), (ii)  Qualified Retirement  (a retirement that occurs at or after the age of 60 with a minimum of 10 years of service with the Company) or (iii) involuntary termination without Cause (other than during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control), then you will receive a payout within 60 days after the end of the Performance Period with respect to any PUs held for at least 180 days after Grant Date as of the date of your separation from service. The amount of such payout shall be based on actual performance at the end of the Performance Period; provided, however, that if a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, then such payout shall be determined as provided below with respect to PUs that are outstanding on the date upon which a Change of Control occurs.  In addition, solely in the case of Retirement (but not in the case of a separation from service described in clause (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this paragraph), such payout shall be prorated based on the number of months you worked during the Performance Period. In the case of a separation from service described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first sentence of this paragraph, all unvested PUs held for less than 180 days after Grant Date as of the date of your separation from service will be immediately forfeited as of the date of your separation from service.  For purposes of determining whether you have a Qualified Retirement, years of service with the Company shall be determined from your hire date, or if you previously worked for the Company or one of its affiliates, from your most recent hire date with the Company.

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Award Agreement, the following provisions shall apply in the event a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period and while your PUs remain outstanding: 
    
           (i) 
    The Company s TSR ranking relative to the peer group shall be determined as if the date upon which the Change of Control occurs (the  Change of Control Date ) is the last day of the Performance Period, and a preliminary calculation of the value of the earned PUs for the Performance Period will be made as of such date (the  Preliminary PU Amount ), which amount will be (A) equal to your Target   multiplied by   the applicable percentage under the  Payout as % of Target  column of the table above based on the Company s relative TSR ranking for the Performance Period   multiplied by   the Fair Market Value of the Company s Common Stock as of the first trading day immediately preceding the Change of Control Date and (B) solely in the event of your Retirement (but not in the event of your Qualified Retirement) on or before the Change of Control Date, prorated based on the number of months you worked during the Performance Period (determined without regard to the Change of Control); 
       
           (ii) 
    On the Change of Control Date, your PUs that are outstanding on such date shall be converted into restricted equity units in respect of the common equity security of the Surviving Company (as hereinafter defined), the number of which shall be determined by dividing the Preliminary PU Amount by the fair market value of one such common equity security as of the first business day immediately prior to the Change of Control Date (as determined in good faith by the Committee which, in the case of a publicly-traded security, shall be based on the closing price of such security on the principal exchange upon which it is traded as of the applicable date); 
       
           (iii) 
    Each such restricted equity unit shall, from and after the Change of Control Date, be subject to equitable adjustment by the board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) of the Surviving Company as if such unit had been granted under the Plan, and such restricted equity units shall be credited with dividend equivalents (in a manner similar to that provided in Section 11.4 of the Plan), which dividend equivalents shall be accrued and deemed reinvested in additional common equity securities of the Surviving Company and paid, less applicable taxes, at such time as the restricted equity units to which they relate vest and settle; 
       
           (iv) 
    Subject to the provisions of clause (v) below, (A) each such restricted equity unit shall vest and be earned on the last day of the Performance Period (determined without regard to the occurrence of the Change of Control) and the payment amount with respect thereto shall be based on the fair market value of the common equity security of the Surviving Company as of the last day of the Performance Period (determined without regard to the occurrence of the Change of Control) and (B) the payment amount, less applicable withholding taxes, shall be paid to you in cash within 10 days after the end of the Performance Period (determined without regard to the occurrence of the Change of Control); and 
     
   4 

(v) 
    Each such restricted equity unit (and the related dividend equivalents) shall be subject to the same forfeiture, time of payment and, in the event of your Retirement (but not in the event of your Qualified Retirement) after the Change of Control Date, proration provisions as are provided in the four paragraphs preceding this paragraph and shall be paid, less applicable withholding taxes, in cash; provided, however, that (A) a payment due upon your death on or after the Change of Control Date shall be based on the fair market value of the common equity security of the Surviving Company as of the date of your death and shall be paid within 10 days after the date of your death without regard to any longer period that may be provided pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this Award Agreement, (B) a payment due after the end of the Performance Period (determined without regard to the occurrence of the Change of Control) shall be based on the fair market value of the common equity security of the Surviving Company as of the last day of the Performance Period (determined without regard to the occurrence of the Change of Control) and shall be paid within 10 days after the last day of the Performance Period without regard to any longer period that may be provided pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this Award Agreement, and (C) if the Change of Control constitutes a Section 409A Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) and if you incur a separation from service during the two-year period beginning on the Change of Control Date due to (I) disability (as defined in the Company s disability plan), (II) Retirement, (III) Qualified Retirement, (IV) involuntary termination without Cause or (V) termination of employment for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following the Change of Control, then (x) you will receive a payout with respect to your restricted equity units on the first business day that is at least six months and one day following the applicable separation from service (or, if earlier, within 10 days after the earlier of the date of your death or the last day of the Performance Period (determined without regard to the occurrence of the Change of Control)), (y) such payout will be based on the fair market value of the common equity security of the Surviving Company as of the fifth business day immediately preceding the date of such payment (or, if the payment is to be made within 10 days after the last day of the Performance Period (determined without regard to the occurrence of the Change of Control), then such payout amount will be based on the fair market value of the common equity security of the Surviving Company as of the last day of the Performance Period (determined without regard to the occurrence of the Change of Control)), and (z) solely in the case of Retirement (but not in the case of a separation from service described in subclause (I), (III), (IV) or (V) of this clause (C)), such payout shall be prorated based on the number of months you worked during the Performance Period (determined without regard to the occurrence of the Change of Control). 
       
  Any determination of fair market value required pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) of the preceding paragraph shall be made in good faith by the board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) of the Surviving Company (which, in the case of a publicly-traded security, shall be based on the closing price of such security on the principal exchange upon which it is traded as of the applicable date). 
    
  As used herein, the term  Surviving Company  means the entity designated by the Committee on or before the Change of Control Date as resulting from the Change of Control.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may be the Surviving Company depending on the facts and circumstances  
  
   5 

relating to the Change of Control.  As used herein, the term  Section 409A Change of Control  means a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2.8 of the Plan without regard to the last sentence of such section) that also constitutes a change in control event (as defined in Treasury regulation section 1.409A-3(i)(5)).  
    
  Your PUs are subject to several restrictions, including that such PUs may not be transferred, sold, assigned, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred, or disposed of to the extent then subject to restrictions. 
    
  If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and if you knowingly engaged in the misconduct, were grossly negligent with respect to such misconduct, or knowingly or grossly negligently failed to prevent the misconduct (whether or not you are one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), the Plan Administrator may determine that you shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award earned or accrued during the twelve-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement. 
    
  Notwithstanding anything in this Award Agreement or any other agreement between you and the Company to the contrary, including, without limitation, any provisions that prevent the Company from unilaterally amending this Award Agreement, you agree by accepting this Award that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Act ) has the effect of requiring certain officers of the Company to repay the Company, and for the Company to recoup from such officers, erroneously awarded amounts of incentive-based compensation.  If the Act, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any similar federal or state law requires the Company to recoup any erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation (including stock options and any other equity-based awards) that the Company has paid or granted to you, you hereby agree, even if you have terminated your employment with the Company, to promptly repay such erroneously awarded incentive compensation to the Company upon its written request.  This obligation shall survive the termination of this Award Agreement. 
    
  After your employment relationship with the Company terminates for any reason, you acknowledge and agree, by accepting the Award Agreement, that you remain subject to the following obligations ( Post-Termination Obligations ), which serve to align your interests with the Company s long-term business interests.  The following Post-Termination Obligations are reasonably related to the protection of such business interests, including the preservation of the Company s goodwill and the protection of the confidential information that you have obtained and will obtain in the course of your future employment with the Company.   
    
  a.       Non-Disclosure  .  You will comply with the obligations contained in the Anadarko Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that continue after termination of employment to not disclose or utilize certain confidential information of the Company and its affiliates as specified therein.  As an officer of the Company, the law imposes upon you a duty to safeguard and protect confidential information of the Company and its affiliates.  Except as expressly permitted by this Award Agreement and without limiting the foregoing, you shall not use for your own benefit or the benefit of any person or entity (other than the Company and its  
  
   6 

affiliates), or disclose to any person or entity (other than the Company and its affiliates), any information relating to confidential information of the Company or its affiliates made, developed or acquired by or disclosed to you, individually or in conjunction with others, during your employment with the Company or its affiliates (whether during business hours or otherwise and whether on the Company s premises or otherwise).  The non-disclosure requirements set forth in this paragraph (a) are subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) ( Disclosures ) below. 
    
  b.      Non-Disparagement  .  For a term of one (1) year beginning on the last day of your employment with the Company, you shall make no disparaging remarks regarding or relating to Anadarko, its affiliates, or any employee or director of Anadarko or its affiliates.  The non-disparagement requirements set forth in this paragraph (b) are subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) ( Disclosures ) below. 
    
  c.      Non-Solicitation  .  For a term of one (1) year beginning on the last day of your employment with the Company, you will not, directly or indirectly, solicit, or otherwise attempt to induce, any employee of the Company or any of its affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Company or such affiliates, or hire or assist in the hiring of any such employee by any person, association, or entity not affiliated with the Company.   
    
  d.      Remedies  .  Should you violate any Post-Termination Obligation, you will not thereafter be entitled to payment with respect to any of the Awards subject to this Award Agreement that have not yet vested and become payable pursuant to the terms hereof, and such Awards shall be forfeited (without value) to the Company immediately as of the date that you violate such Post-Termination Obligation.  If your violation of any Post-Termination Obligation is not discovered until after any such Award has vested and been paid to you, the Company may require you to return to it the full amount of such payment (determined prior to the application of any applicable tax withholding).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of a Post-Termination Obligation by you.  The Company shall be entitled as a matter of right to specific performance of the Post-Termination Obligations, including entry of an ex parte temporary restraining order in state or federal court, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against activities in violation of this Award Agreement, or both, or other appropriate judicial remedy, writ or order, in any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or further violation of such agreements by you or others acting on your behalf, without any showing of irreparable harm and without any showing that the Company does not have adequate remedy at law.  The remedies specified herein shall not be construed as limiting the remedies available to the Company and shall be in addition to all other remedies available to the Company at law and in equity. If any term, provision, covenant or condition of the Post-Termination Obligations is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, unenforceable, or void, and not correctable through modification, then such provision, covenant, or condition (or portion thereof) may be severed and the validity and enforceability of the remainder of this Award Agreement shall not in any way be affected, impaired or invalidated. 
       
  e.      Disclosures  .  Nothing in this Award Agreement will prevent you from making disparaging remarks or disclosing Company confidential and proprietary information when compelled to do so by law or when such communications are intended to comply with any federal or state whistleblower statute including, but not limited to, information provided in a  
  
   7 

manner described in Section 21F(h)(1)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 78u-6(h)(1)(A).  Nothing in this Award Agreement will prevent you from: (i) making a good faith report of possible violations of applicable law to any governmental agency or entity or (ii) making disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prevent you from making a disclosure of a trade secret that: (A) is made (1) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (2) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.  Further, an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer of reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (X) files any document containing the trade secret under seal and (Y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
