1.   Basis of preparation and consolidation    
  These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (the "Consolidated Financial Statements") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 in Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In addition, the year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in Validus Holdings. Ltd.'s (the "Company") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 
  The Company consolidates in these Consolidated Financial Statements the results of operations and financial position of all voting interest entities ("VOE") in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and all variable interest entities ("VIE") in which the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary. The consolidation assessment, including the determination as to whether an entity qualifies as a VIE or VOE, depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding each entity. 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company early adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-02,    Consolidation (Topic 810) Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis    issued by the United States Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), which changed the method in which the Company determines whether entities are consolidated by the Company. The adoption of this amended accounting guidance was implemented utilizing a full retrospective application for all periods presented in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The amended guidance includes changes in the identification of the primary beneficiary of investment companies considered to be VIEs. These changes resulted in the Company concluding that it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the AlphaCat sidecars, the AlphaCat ILS funds and the BetaCat ILS funds and therefore the Company is required to consolidate these entities. The adoption of the amended guidance also resulted in the Company concluding that it was no longer required to consolidate PaCRe Ltd. ("PaCRe") due to the change in the VIE definition of "kick-out" rights under the amended guidance. The cumulative effect of these changes on the Company's retained earnings through the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was a gain of   $405  .  
  The following tables present the impact of the application of the amended accounting guidance on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  :

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
  (Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages, share and per share information) 

In the opinion of management, these Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial position and results of operations as at the end of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. 
  The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While management believes that the amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect its best estimates and assumptions, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The Company s principal estimates include: 
     reserve for losses and loss expenses; 
     premium estimates for business written on a line slip or proportional basis; 
     the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; 
     reinsurance recoverable balances including the provision for uncollectible amounts; and 
     investment valuation of financial assets. 
  The term  ASC  used in these notes refers to Accounting Standard Codification issued by the FASB.

2.   Recent accounting pronouncements    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)    (ASU 2014-09). The guidance in this ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In March and April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)    and ASU 2016-10,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing .   The amendments in these ASU's clarify the implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09 on principal versus agent considerations and the aspects of identifying performance obligations, respectively, while retaining the related principals in those areas. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   . The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments provide clarifying guidance in a few narrow areas and add practical expedients to reduce the potential for diversity in practice as well as the cost and complexity of applying the guidance. The original effective date for the amendments in ASU 2014-09 was for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, in August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date by one year through the issuance of ASU 2015-14,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   . As such, the new effective date is for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities may adopt the standard as of the original effective date; however, earlier adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842)   .  The amendments in this ASU increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   .  The amendments in this ASU simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,    Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)   .   The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   . This ASU is directed at reducing diversity in practice and addresses eight specific issues in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,    Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   . This ASU aims to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. Current U.S. GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The ASU states that an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The ASU does not include new disclosure requirements; however, existing disclosure requirements might be applicable when accounting for the current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The ASU is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. That is, earlier adoption should be in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,    Consolidation (Topic 810) - Interests Held Through Related Parties That Are Under Common Control   . The amendments in this ASU does not change the characteristics of a primary beneficiary in current U.S. GAAP. The ASU requires that a reporting entity, in determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic of a primary beneficiary, include all of its direct variable interests in a VIE and, on a proportionate basis, its indirect variable interests in a VIE held through related parties, including related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. Entities that have not yet adopted ASU 2015-02 are required to adopt the amendments in this update at the same time and should apply the same transition method elected for the application of the ASU. Entities that already have adopted ASU 2015-02 are required to apply the amendments in this update retrospectively to all relevant prior periods beginning with the fiscal year in which ASU 2015-02 initially were applied. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

3.   Investments    
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company enhanced disclosures with respect to the allocation of invested assets and the related returns between managed and non-managed investments. Managed investments represent assets governed by the Company s investment policy statement ( IPS ), whereas non-managed investments represent assets held in support of consolidated AlphaCat VIEs which are not governed by the Company s IPS. Refer to Note   5  ,   "  Variable interest entities  ,"   for further details. As such, prior period disclosures have been revised to conform to the current period presentation.  
  The Company classifies its fixed maturity and short-term investments as trading and accounts for its other investments in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance for   "Financial Instruments."   As such, all investments are carried at fair value with interest and dividend income and realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income for the period.  
  The amortized cost (or cost), gross unrealized gains and (losses) and fair value of the Company's investments as at   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

(a) 
    Fixed maturity investments 
     The following table sets forth certain information regarding the investment ratings of the Company s fixed maturity investments as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

The amortized cost and fair value amounts for the Company's fixed maturity investments held at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are shown below by contractual maturity. Actual maturity may differ from contractual maturity because certain borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

(b) 
    Other investments 
     The following tables set forth certain information regarding the Company's other investment portfolio as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Other investments include alternative investments in various funds and pooled investment schemes. These alternative investments employ various investment strategies primarily involving, but not limited to, investments in collateralized obligations, fixed income securities, private equities, distressed debt and equity securities.  
  Certain securities included in other investments are subject to redemption restrictions and are unable to be redeemed from the funds. Distributions from these funds will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are liquidated. Currently, it is not known to the Company when these underlying assets will be sold by their investment managers; however, it is estimated that the majority of the underlying assets of the investments would liquidate over   five   to   ten   years from inception of the funds. In addition,   one   of the investment funds with a fair value of   $180,695   (  December 31, 2015  :   $167,910  ), has a lock-up period of   three years   as at   September 30, 2016   and may also impose a redemption gate. A lock-up period refers to the initial amount of time an investor is contractually required to remain invested before having the ability to redeem. Typically, the imposition of a gate delays a portion of the requested redemption, with the remaining portion settled in cash shortly after the redemption date. Furthermore, the underlying investments held in the overseas deposit funds are liquid and will generally trade freely in an open market. However, the Company's ability to withdraw from the overseas deposit funds is restricted by an annual and quarterly funding and release process for Lloyd's market participants. 
  The Company's maximum exposure to any of these alternative investments is limited to the amount invested and any remaining capital commitments. Refer to Note   15  ,   "  Commitments and contingencies  ,"   for further details. As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not have any plans to sell any of the other investments listed above.  
           (c) 
    Net investment income 
     Net investment income was derived from the following sources: 

Managed net investment income from other investments includes distributed and undistributed net income from certain investment funds.

    Net realized and change in net unrealized gains (losses) on investments 
     The following represents an analysis of net realized and change in net unrealized gains (losses) on investments: 

(e) 
    Pledged cash and investments 
     As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $5,104,602   (  December 31, 2015  :   $4,056,788  ) of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and fixed maturity investments that were pledged during the normal course of business. Of those,   $4,975,676   were held in trust (  December 31, 2015  :   $4,007,215  ). Pledged assets are generally for the benefit of the Company's cedants and policyholders, to support AlphaCat's fully collateralized reinsurance transactions and to facilitate the accreditation of Validus Reinsurance, Ltd., Validus Reinsurance (Switzerland) Ltd. ("Validus Re Swiss") and Talbot as an alien insurer/reinsurer by certain regulators. 
  In addition, the Company has pledged cash and investments as collateral under the Company's credit facilities in the total amount of   $548,669   (December 31, 2015:   $826,535  ). For further details on the credit facilities, please refer to Note   13  ,      Debt and financing arrangements  .  
  During December 2014, Validus Reinsurance, Ltd. established a Multi-Beneficiary Reinsurance Trust ("MBRT") to collateralize its (re)insurance liabilities associated with and for the benefit of U.S. domiciled cedants, and was approved as a trusteed reinsurer in the State of New Jersey. As a result, cedants domiciled in that state will receive automatic credit in their regulatory filings for the reinsurance provided prospectively by the Company. As of   September 30, 2016  , Validus Reinsurance, Ltd. was approved as a trusteed reinsurer in   50   states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. In addition, Validus Re Swiss established a MBRT in December 2015 and was approved as a trusteed reinsurer in   36   states as at   September 30, 2016  .

4.   Fair value measurements    
           (a) 
    Classification within the fair value hierarchy 
     Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under U.S. GAAP, a company must determine the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for each fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, into three levels. It gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 
  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 
  Level 1 - Fair values are measured based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. 
  Level 2 - Fair values are measured based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or for which significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
  Level 3 - Fair values are measured based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own judgments about assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity for that asset or liability that market participants might use. 
  The availability of observable inputs can vary from financial instrument to financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors including, for example, the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the instrument. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires significantly more judgment.  
  Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This may lead the Company to change the selection of our valuation technique (for example, from market to cash flow approach) or to use multiple valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of a financial instrument. These circumstances could cause an instrument to be reclassified between levels within the fair value hierarchy.

    Valuation techniques 
     There have been no material changes in the Company's valuation techniques during the period, or periods, represented by these Consolidated Financial Statements. The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of each class of financial instrument recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  Fixed maturity investments 
  In general, valuation of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio is provided by pricing services, such as index providers and pricing vendors, as well as broker quotations. The pricing vendors provide valuations for a high volume of liquid securities that are actively traded. For securities that do not trade on an exchange, the pricing services generally utilize market data and other observable inputs in matrix pricing models to determine month end prices. Prices are generally verified using third party data. Securities which are priced by an index provider are generally included in the index.

In general, broker-dealers value securities through their trading desks based on observable inputs. The methodologies include mapping securities based on trade data, bids or offers, observed spreads, and performance on newly issued securities. Broker-dealers also determine valuations by observing secondary trading of similar securities. Prices obtained from broker quotations are considered non-binding, however they are based on observable inputs and by observing secondary trading of similar securities obtained from active, non-distressed markets. The Company considers these Level 2 inputs as they are corroborated with other market observable inputs. The techniques generally used to determine the fair value of the Company's fixed maturity investments are detailed below by asset class. 
  U.S. government and government agency 
  U.S. government and government agency securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and mortgage pass-through agencies such as the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Government National Mortgage Association. Fixed maturity investments included in U.S. government and government agency securities are primarily priced by pricing services. When evaluating these securities, the pricing services gather information from market sources and integrate other observations from markets and sector news. Evaluations are updated by obtaining broker dealer quotes and other market information including actual trade volumes, when available. The fair value of each security is individually computed using analytical models which incorporate option adjusted spreads and other daily interest rate data. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2. 
  Non-U.S. government and government agency 
  Non-U.S. government and government agency securities consist of debt securities issued by non-U.S. governments and their agencies along with supranational organizations (also known as sovereign debt securities). Securities held in these sectors are primarily priced by pricing services who employ proprietary discounted cash flow models to value the securities. Key quantitative inputs for these models are daily observed benchmark curves for treasury, swap and high issuance credits. The pricing services then apply a credit spread for each security which is developed by in-depth and real time market analysis. For securities in which trade volume is low, the pricing services utilize data from more frequently traded securities with similar attributes. These models may also be supplemented by daily market and credit research for international markets. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2. 
  U.S. states, municipalities and political subdivisions 
  The Company's U.S. states, municipalities and political subdivisions portfolio contains debt securities issued by U.S. domiciled state and municipal entities. These securities are generally priced by independent pricing services using the techniques described for U.S. government and government agency securities described above. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2. 
  Agency residential mortgage-backed securities 
  The Company's agency residential mortgage-backed investments are primarily priced by pricing services using a mortgage pool specific model which utilizes daily inputs from the active to be announced (     TBA     ) market which is very liquid, as well as the U.S. treasury market. The model also utilizes additional information, such as the weighted average maturity, weighted average coupon and other available pool level data which is provided by the sponsoring agency. Valuations are also corroborated with daily active market quotes. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2. 
  Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities 
  The Company's non-agency mortgage-backed investments include non-agency prime residential mortgage-backed fixed maturity investments. The Company has no fixed maturity investments classified as sub-prime held in its fixed maturity investments portfolio. Securities held in these sectors are primarily priced by pricing services using an option adjusted spread model or other relevant models, which principally utilize inputs including benchmark yields, available trade information or broker quotes, and issuer spreads. The pricing services also review collateral prepayment speeds, loss severity and delinquencies among other collateral performance indicators for the securities valuation, when applicable. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2.

U.S. corporate 
  Corporate debt securities consist primarily of investment-grade debt of a wide variety of U.S. corporate issuers and industries. The Company's corporate fixed maturity investments are primarily priced by pricing services. When evaluating these securities, the pricing services gather information from market sources regarding the issuer of the security and obtain credit data, as well as other observations, from markets and sector news. Evaluations are updated by obtaining broker dealer quotes and other market information including actual trade volumes, when available. The pricing services also consider the specific terms and conditions of the securities, including any specific features which may influence risk. In certain instances, securities are individually evaluated using a spread which is added to the U.S. treasury curve or a security specific swap curve as appropriate. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2. 
  Non-U.S. corporate 
  Non-U.S. corporate debt securities consist primarily of investment-grade debt of a wide variety of non-U.S. corporate issuers and industries. The Company's non-U.S. corporate fixed maturity investments are primarily priced by pricing services. When evaluating these securities, the pricing services gather information from market sources regarding the issuer of the security and obtain credit data, as well as other observations, from markets and sector news. Evaluations are updated by obtaining broker dealer quotes and other market information including actual trade volumes, when available. The pricing services also consider the specific terms and conditions of the securities, including any specific features which may influence risk. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2. 
  Bank loans 
  The Company's bank loan investments consist primarily of below-investment-grade debt of a wide variety of corporate issuers and industries. The Company's bank loans are primarily priced by pricing services. When evaluating these securities, the pricing services gather information from market sources regarding the issuer of the security and obtain credit data, as well as other observations, from markets and sector news. Evaluations are updated by obtaining broker dealer quotes and other market information including actual trade volumes, when available. The pricing services also consider the specific terms and conditions of the securities, including any specific features which may influence risk. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2. 
  Also, included in the bank loan portfolio is a collection of loan participations held through an intermediary. A third party pricing service provides monthly valuation reports for each loan and participation using a combination of quotations from loan pricing services, leveraged loan indices or market price quotes obtained directly from the intermediary. Significant unobservable inputs used to price these securities include credit spreads and default rates; therefore, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 3. 
  Asset-backed securities 
  Asset backed securities include mostly investment-grade debt securities backed by pools of loans with a variety of underlying collateral, including automobile loan receivables, student loans, credit card receivables, and collateralized loan obligations originated by a variety of financial institutions. Securities held in these sectors are primarily priced by pricing services. The pricing services apply dealer quotes and other available trade information such as bids and offers, prepayment speeds which may be adjusted for the underlying collateral or current price data, the U.S. treasury curve and swap curve as well as cash settlement. The pricing services determine the expected cash flows for each security held in this sector using historical prepayment and default projections for the underlying collateral and current market data. In addition, a spread is applied to the relevant benchmark and used to discount the cash flows noted above to determine the fair value of the securities held in this sector. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2.  Where pricing is unavailable from pricing services, we obtain non-binding quotes from broker-dealers. This is generally the case when there is a low volume of trading activity and current transactions are not orderly. Broker-dealer quotes for which significant observable inputs are unable to be corroborated with market observable information are classified as Level 3.

Commercial mortgage-backed securities 
  Commercial mortgage backed securities are investment-grade debt primarily priced by pricing services. The pricing services apply dealer quotes and other available trade information such as bids and offers, prepayment speeds which may be adjusted for the underlying collateral or current price data, the U.S. treasury curve and swap curve as well as cash settlement. The pricing services determine the expected cash flows for each security held in this sector using historical prepayment and default projections for the underlying collateral and current market data. In addition, a spread is applied to the relevant benchmark and used to discount the cash flows noted above to determine the fair value of the securities held in this sector. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2. 
  Catastrophe bonds 
  Catastrophe bonds are priced based on broker or underwriter bid indications. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2. To the extent that these indications are based on significant unobservable inputs, the fair value of the relevant bonds will be classified as a Level 3. 
  Short-term investments 
  Short-term investments consist primarily of highly liquid securities, all with maturities of less than one year from the date of purchase. The fair value of the portfolio is generally determined using amortized cost which approximates fair value. As the highly liquid money market-type funds are actively traded, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 1. To the extent that the remaining securities are not actively traded due to their approaching maturity, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2.  
  Other investments 
  Fund of hedge funds 
  The fund of hedge funds includes a side pocket. While a redemption request has been submitted, the timing of receipt of proceeds on the side pocket is unknown. The fund's administrator provides a monthly reported NAV with a   three   month delay in its valuation. The fund manager has provided an estimate of the fund NAV at each period end based on the estimated performance provided from the underlying funds. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated NAV, the Company compares the fund administrator's NAV to the fund manager's estimated NAV that incorporates relevant valuation sources on a timely basis. Material variances are recorded in the current reporting period while immaterial variances are recorded in the following reporting period. The fair value of these investments are measured using the NAV practical expedient and therefore have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy. 
  Hedge funds 
  The hedge funds consist of   one   investment assumed in the acquisition of Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings, S.A. ("Flagstone") (the "Flagstone hedge fund"). The Flagstone hedge fund's administrator provides quarterly NAVs with a   three   month delay in valuation. The fair value of this investment is measured using the NAV practical expedient and therefore has not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy. 
  Private equity investments 
  The private equity funds provide quarterly or semi-annual partnership capital statements with a   three   or   six   month delay which are used as a basis for valuation. These private equity investments vary in investment strategies and are not actively traded in any open markets. The fair value of these investments are measured using the NAV practical expedient and therefore have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy. 
  Fixed income investment funds 
  Fixed income investment funds consist of   one   pooled investment,   two   structured securities funds and a mezzanine debt fund. The pooled investment is invested in fixed income securities with high credit ratings and is only open to Lloyd s Trust Fund participants. The fair value of units in the investment fund is based on the NAV of the fund as reported by Lloyd s Treasury   Investment Management. As the fund NAV is published, the fair value of this investment is classified as Level 2.

  (Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages, share and per share information) 

The structured securities funds invest across asset backed, residential mortgage backed and commercial mortgage backed securities, whereas the mezzanine debt fund invests in a portfolio of mezzanine securities which generally take the form of private debt securities in connection with buyouts, recapitalizations and refinancings. The fair value of units in each fund is based on the NAV of the respective fund as reported by the independent fund administrator. The NAV for each fund is reported on a one or three month delay by the fund's administrator. The fair value of these investments are measured using the NAV practical expedient and therefore have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy. 
  Overseas deposits 
  The Company's share of a portfolio of Lloyd's overseas deposits are managed centrally by Lloyd's and invested according to local regulatory requirements. The composition of the portfolio varies and the deposits are made across the market. The fair value of the deposits is based on the portfolio level reporting that is provided by Lloyd's. The fair value of these investments are measured using the NAV practical expedient and therefore have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy. 
  Mutual funds 
  Mutual funds consist of   two   investment funds which are invested in various quoted investments. The fair value of units in the mutual funds are based on the NAV of the funds as reported by the fund manager. As the NAVs for each fund are published, the fair value of these investments are classified as Level 2.

5.   Variable interest entities    
  The Company consolidates all VOEs in which it has a controlling financial interest and all VIEs in which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary. The Company s VIEs are primarily entities in the AlphaCat segment. 
           (a) 
    Consolidated VIEs 
     AlphaCat sidecars 
  Beginning on   May 25, 2011  , the Company joined with third party investors in capitalizing a series of sidecars for the purpose of investing in collateralized reinsurance and retrocessional contracts. Certain of these sidecars deployed their capital through transactions entered into by AlphaCat Reinsurance Ltd. ( AlphaCat Re ). Each of these entities return capital once the risk period expires and all losses have been paid out. The AlphaCat sidecars are VIEs and are consolidated by the Company as the primary beneficiary. The Company's maximum exposure to any of the sidecars is the amount of capital invested at any given time and any remaining capital commitments.  
  AlphaCat ILS funds 
  The AlphaCat ILS funds received third party subscriptions beginning on   December 17, 2012  . The Company and third party investors invest in the AlphaCat ILS funds for the purpose of investing in instruments with returns linked to property catastrophe reinsurance, retrocession and insurance linked securities ( ILS ) contracts. The AlphaCat ILS funds have varying risk profiles and are categorized by the expected loss of the fund. Expected loss represents the average annual loss over the set of simulation scenarios divided by the total limit. Lower risk ILS funds are defined as having a maximum permitted portfolio expected loss of less than   7%  , whereas higher risk ILS funds have a maximum permitted portfolio expected loss of greater than   7%  . The AlphaCat ILS funds primarily deploy their capital through transactions entered into by AlphaCat Re and AlphaCat Master Fund Ltd. ( AlphaCat Master Fund ). The AlphaCat ILS funds are VIEs and are consolidated by the Company as the primary beneficiary. The Company's maximum exposure to any of the funds is the amount of capital invested at any given time and any remaining capital commitments. Refer to Note   15  ,   "  Commitments and contingencies  ,"   for further details. 
  AlphaCat Re and AlphaCat Master Fund 
  The Company utilizes AlphaCat Re and AlphaCat Master Fund (collectively the  master funds ), both market facing entities, for the purpose of writing collateralized reinsurance and investing in capital markets products, respectively, on behalf of certain entities within the AlphaCat segment and direct third party investors. AlphaCat Re enters into transactions on behalf of the AlphaCat sidecars and ILS funds (collectively the  feeder funds ) and direct third party investors, whereas AlphaCat Master Fund only enters into transactions on behalf of certain AlphaCat ILS funds. All of the risks and rewards of the underlying transactions are allocated to the feeder funds and direct third party investors using variable funding notes. The master funds are VIEs and are consolidated by the Company as the primary beneficiary.  
  Notes Payable to AlphaCat Investors 
  The master funds issue variable funding notes to the feeder funds, and direct to third party investors, in order to write collateralized reinsurance and invest in capital markets products on their behalf. The Company s investments in the feeder funds, together with investments made by third parties in the feeder funds and on a direct basis, are provided as consideration for the notes to the master funds. The duration of the underlying collateralized reinsurance contracts and capital market products is typically   twelve   months; however, the variable funding notes do not have a stated maturity date or principal amount since repayment is dependent on the settlement and income or loss of the underlying transactions. Therefore, the notes are subsequently redeemed as the underlying transactions are settled. The income or loss generated by the underlying transactions is then transferred to the feeder funds and direct third party investors via the variable funding notes. 
  As both the master and feeder funds are consolidated by the Company, any notes issued by the master funds to the feeder funds are eliminated on consolidation and only variable funding notes issued by AlphaCat Re to direct third party investors remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as notes payable to AlphaCat investors with the related income or loss included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as (income) loss attributable to AlphaCat investors. To the extent that the (income) loss has not been returned to the investors, it is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   one   of the AlphaCat ILS funds issued both common shares and structured notes to the Company and other third party investors in order to capitalize the fund. The fund deploys its capital through AlphaCat Re; therefore, the structured notes do not have a stated maturity date or principal amount since repayment is dependent on the settlement and income or loss of the variable funding notes with AlphaCat Re. The structured notes rank senior to the common shares and earn an interest rate of   8.0%   per annum, payable on a cumulative basis in arrears.

As the fund is consolidated by the Company, the structured notes issued to the Company are eliminated on consolidation and only the structured notes issued to third party investors remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as notes payable to AlphaCat investors with any related interest included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as (income) loss attributable to AlphaCat investors. To the extent that the accrued interest on the structured notes has not been returned to the investors, it is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending notes payable to AlphaCat investors as at    September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  : 

The income attributable to AlphaCat investors was   $5,564   (  2015  :   $1,438  ) and   $16,278   (  2015  :   $1,438  ) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, with   $18,690   included in accounts payable and accrued expenses as at   September 30, 2016   (December 31, 2015:   $2,412  ). 
  BetaCat ILS funds 
  The BetaCat ILS funds invest exclusively in catastrophe bonds (principal-at-risk variable rate notes and other event-linked securities, being referred to collectively as  Cat Bonds ) focused on property and casualty risk issued under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, following a passive buy-and-hold investment strategy.   One   of the funds is a VIE and is consolidated by the Company as it is the primary beneficiary. The remaining funds are VOEs and are consolidated by the Company as it owns all of the voting equity interests. The Company's maximum exposure to any of the funds is the amount of capital invested at any given time. 
  The following table presents the total assets and total liabilities of the Company s consolidated VIEs, excluding intercompany eliminations, as at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  : 

(a) 
    Lower risk AlphaCat ILS funds have a maximum permitted portfolio expected loss of less than 7%, whereas higher risk AlphaCat ILS funds have a maximum permitted portfolio expected loss of greater than 7%. Expected loss represents the average annual loss over the set of simulation scenarios divided by the total limit.  
     Assets of consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs and do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. Investments held by these entities are presented separately in Note   3  ,   "  Investments  ,"   as non-managed investments.

(b) 
    Non-Consolidated VIEs 
     The Company invests in private equity and other investment vehicles as part of the Company's investment portfolio. The activities of these VIEs are generally limited to holding investments and the Company's involvement in these entities is passive in nature. The Company's maximum exposure to the VIEs is the amount of capital invested at any given time, and the Company does not have the power to direct the activities which most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. The Company is therefore not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. 
   
  6.   Investments in affiliates    
  The following table presents the Company's investments in affiliates as at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  : 

(a) 
    Investment affiliate 
     Aquiline Financial Services Fund II L.P. 
  On December 20, 2011, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the "Agreement") with Aquiline Capital Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Aquiline Capital") and Aquiline Capital Partners II GP (Offshore) Ltd., a Cayman Islands company limited by shares (the "Aquiline II General Partner") pursuant to which the Company has assumed   100%   of Aquiline Capital's interest in Aquiline Financial Services Fund II L.P. (the "Aquiline II Partnership") representing a total capital commitment of   $50,000   (the "Aquiline II Commitment"), as a limited partner in the Partnership (the "Transferred Interest"). The Transferred Interest is governed by the terms of an Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement of the Fund dated January 9, 2013 (the "Aquiline II Limited Partnership Agreement").  
  On October 2, 2014, the Company assumed an additional investment in the Aquiline II Partnership as part of the Western World acquisition representing a total capital commitment of   $10,000  . This interest is also governed by the terms of the Aquiline II Limited Partnership Agreement.  
  The Aquiline II Partnership is a VIE and the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the Company's investment in the Aquiline II Partnership has been treated as an equity method investment. The Aquiline II Partnership provides a quarterly capital account statement, with a   three   month delay in its valuation, which was used as the basis for calculating the Company's share of the Aquiline II Partnership income for the period.  
  In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, no limited partner has the right to withdraw from the Aquiline II Partnership or to withdraw any part of its capital account without prior consent from the Aquiline II General Partner. The Company's maximum exposure to the Aquiline II Partnership is limited to the amount invested and any remaining capital commitment. Refer to Note   15  ,   "  Commitments and contingencies  ,"   for further details. 
  Aquiline Financial Services Fund III L.P. 
  On November 7, 2014, the Company, entered into a Subscription Agreement (the "Subscription Agreement") with Aquiline Capital Partners III GP (Offshore) Ltd., a Cayman Islands company limited by shares (the "Aquiline III General Partner") pursuant to which the Company committed and agreed to purchase limited partnership or other comparable limited liability equity interests (the "Limited Partnership Interests") in Aquiline Financial Services Fund III L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (the "Aquiline III Partnership"), and/or one or more Alternative Investment Vehicles and Intermediate Entities (together with the Aquiline III Partnership, the "Aquiline Fund" or the "Entities") with a capital commitment (the "Aquiline III Commitment") in an amount equal to   $100,000  , as a limited partner in the Aquiline III Partnership. The Limited Partnership Interests are governed by the terms of an Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement dated as of November 7, 2014 (the  Aquiline III Limited Partnership Agreement ).  
  The Aquiline III Partnership is a VIE and the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the Company's investment in the Aquiline III Partnership has been treated as an equity method investment. The Aquiline III Partnership provides a quarterly capital account statement, with a   three   month delay in its valuation, which was used as the basis for calculating the Company's share of Aquiline III Partnership income for the period.

     PaCRe, Ltd. 
  On   April 2, 2012  , the Company joined with other investors in capitalizing PaCRe, a Class 4 Bermuda reinsurer formed for the purpose of writing high excess property catastrophe reinsurance. During the fourth quarter of 2015, PaCRe's Class 4 license was surrendered and the company was considered off-risk effective January 1, 2016. The final distribution of the Company s investment occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and PaCRe was dissolved during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company's investment in PaCRe was treated as an equity method investment and the maximum exposure to the fund was the amount of capital invested at any given time. 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending investment in the Company's operating affiliate balance for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

7.   Noncontrolling interests    
  Investors in certain of the AlphaCat ILS funds have rights that enable them, subject to certain limitations, to redeem their shares. The third party equity is therefore recorded in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as redeemable noncontrolling interest. When and if a redemption notice is received, the fair value of the redemption is reclassified to a liability.  
  The AlphaCat sidecars and one of the AlphaCat ILS funds have no shareholder redemption rights. Therefore, the third party equity is recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncontrolling interest. 
  The following tables present a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of redeemable noncontrolling interest and noncontrolling interest for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

8.   Derivative instruments    
  The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes, specifically to hedge unmatched foreign currency exposures, interest rate exposures and to shorten the duration of the Company's fixed maturities portfolio.  
  (a) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 
  The following table summarizes information on the classification and amount of the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(a) 
    Asset and liability derivatives are classified within other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, within the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  
     The following table summarizes information on the classification and the impact on earnings, recognized in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income relating to the foreign currency and interest rate forward contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

(c)  
    Classification within the fair value hierarchy 
     As described in Note   4  ,   "  Fair value measurements  ,"   under U.S. GAAP, a company must determine the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for each fair value measurement. The assumptions used within the valuation of the Company's derivative instruments are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which other similar transactions are executed in the marketplace. Accordingly, these derivatives were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
           (d) 
    Derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge 
     The Company designates certain foreign currency derivative instruments as fair value hedges for accounting purposes and formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between the derivative instruments and hedged items and links the derivative instruments to specific assets and liabilities. The Company assesses the effectiveness of these hedges, both at inception and on an on-going basis and determines whether the hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value of the linked hedged items. 
  The following table provides the total impact on earnings, recognized in income within foreign exchange gains (losses), relating to the derivative instruments formally designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes along with the impact of the related hedged items for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(e) 
    Derivative instruments designated as a cash flow hedge 
     The Company designates its interest rate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items and links the derivative instruments to specific assets and liabilities. The Company assesses the effectiveness of the hedges, both at inception and on an on-going basis and determines whether the hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value of the linked hedged items. The Company currently applies the long haul method when assessing the hedge's effectiveness.  
  The following table provides the total impact on other comprehensive income (loss) and earnings relating to the derivative instruments formally designated as cash flow hedges along with the impact of the related hedged items for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The above balances relate to interest payments and have therefore been classified as finance expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 
           (f) 
    Balance sheet offsetting 
     There was no balance sheet offsetting activity as at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Company currently provides cash collateral as security for interest rate swap contracts. The Company does not provide cash collateral or financial instruments as security for foreign currency forward contracts. Our derivative instruments are generally traded under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreements, which establish terms that apply to all transactions. On a periodic basis, the amounts receivable from or payable to the counterparties are settled in cash. 
  The Company has not elected to settle multiple transactions with an individual counterparty on a net basis.

9.   Reserve for losses and loss expenses    
  Reserve for losses and loss expenses are based in part upon the estimation of case reserves from broker, insured and ceding company reported data. The Company also uses statistical and actuarial methods to estimate ultimate expected losses and loss expenses, from which incurred but not reported reserves ("IBNR") can be calculated. The period of time from the occurrence of a loss to the reporting of a loss to the Company and to the settlement of the Company's liability may be several months or years. During this period, additional facts and trends may be revealed. As these factors become apparent, reserves will be adjusted, sometimes requiring an increase or decrease in the overall reserves of the Company, and at other times requiring a reallocation of IBNR to specific case reserves. These estimates are reviewed and adjusted regularly, and such adjustments, if any, are reflected in earnings in the period in which they become known. While management believes that it has made a reasonable estimate of ultimate losses, there can be no assurances that ultimate losses and loss expenses will not exceed this estimate. 
  The following table summarizes the total reserve for losses and loss expenses as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The following table represents an analysis of paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred and a reconciliation of the beginning and ending unpaid losses and loss expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(a) 
    Upon closing the acquisition of Western World, an adjustment of   $15,586   was made to increase net reserves to reflect fair value. This adjustment was amortized to income through a reduction in losses and loss expenses of   $2,524   and   $8,639  , respectively, during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , benefiting the loss ratio by   3.9   and   4.4   percentage points, respectively. The remaining fair value adjustment of   $2,340   was fully amortized during 2015.

    Upon closing the acquisition of Western World, an adjustment of   $15,586   was made to increase net reserves to reflect fair value. This adjustment was amortized to income through a reduction in losses and loss expenses of   $2,524   and   $8,639  , respectively, during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , benefiting the loss ratio by   3.9   and   4.4   percentage points, respectively. The remaining fair value adjustment of   $2,340   was fully amortized during 2015.  
     The   September 30, 2016   gross reserves for losses and loss expenses comprise reserves for reported claims of   $1,295,385   (  December 31, 2015  :   $1,278,697  ) and IBNR of   $1,740,602   (  December 31, 2015  :   $1,717,870  ). The net favorable development on prior years by segment and line of business for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

The net favorable development of   $52,885   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to favorable development within Validus Re and Talbot of   $33,033   and   $18,691  , respectively. The Validus Re favorable development was attributable to favorable development on event reserves of   $18,200  , related primarily to Tianjin and the 2015 Chilean earthquake, and   $14,800   of favorable development on attritional losses. The favorable development related to Talbot was attributable to favorable development on attritional losses.

     The Validus Re segment experienced favorable development on prior years primarily due to favorable development on attritional losses and event specific reserves  ; whereas, the   Talbot segment experienced favorable development on prior years primarily due to favorable development on attritional losses and certain events, including the Thailand floods.     The Western World segment experienced favorable development on prior years primarily due to the amortization of the fair value adjustment made at the acquisition date as well as favorable development on attritional losses.

10.   Reinsurance    
  The Company's reinsurance balances recoverable at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

The Company enters into reinsurance and retrocession agreements in order to mitigate its accumulation of loss, reduce its liability on individual risks, enable it to underwrite policies with higher limits and increase its aggregate capacity. The cession of insurance and reinsurance does not legally discharge the Company from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, and the Company is required to pay the loss and bear collection risk if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance or retrocession agreement. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying liabilities. 
  Credit risk 
  The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk arising from its exposure to individual reinsurers. The reinsurance program is generally placed with reinsurers whose rating, at the time of placement, was A- or better as rated by Standard   Poor's or the equivalent with other rating agencies. Exposure to a single reinsurer is also controlled with restrictions dependent on rating. As at   September 30, 2016  ,   $474,367   or   98.7%   (  December 31, 2015  :   $368,638   or   98.7%  ) of the Company's reinsurance balances recoverable were either fully collateralized or recoverable from reinsurers rated A- or better. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the provision for uncollectible reinsurance relating to reinsurance balances recoverable was   $5,140   and   $4,997  , respectively. To estimate this provision for uncollectible reinsurance, reinsurance balances recoverable are first allocated to applicable reinsurers. This determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment is applied, especially in relation to ceded IBNR. The Company then uses default factors to determine the portion of a reinsurer s balance deemed to be uncollectible. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined in part using the current rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. 
  Top ten reinsurers 
  Reinsurance balances recoverable by reinsurer as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

11.   Share capital    
  The Company is authorized to issue up to an aggregate of   571,428,571   common and preferred shares with a par value of   $0.175   per share.  
           (a) 
    Preferred shares 
     On June 13, 2016, the Company issued   6,000   shares of its   5.875%   Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares, Series A (the "Series A Preferred Shares") (equivalent to   6,000,000   Depositary Shares, each of which represents a 1/1,000th interest in a Series A Preferred Share),   $0.175   par value and   $25,000   liquidation preference per share (equivalent to   $25   per Depositary Share). The Series A Preferred Shares were registered and sold under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and were issued at a price to the public of   $25,000   per share (equivalent to   $25   per Depositary Share). After underwriting discounts and expenses, the Company received net proceeds of   $144,852   which will be used for general corporate purposes.  
  The Depositary Shares, representing the Series A Preferred Shares, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  VRPRA.  The Series A Preferred Shares have no stated maturity date and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company s option on and after June 15, 2021, at a redemption price of   $25,000   per Series A Preferred Share (equivalent to   $25   per Depositary Share), plus declared and unpaid dividends. The Company may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Series A Preferred Shares before the redemption date at a redemption price of   $26,000   per share (equivalent to   $26   per Depositary Share), plus declared and unpaid dividends, if the Company is required to submit a proposal to the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares concerning an amalgamation, consolidation, merger or other similar corporate transaction or change in Bermuda law. The Series A Preferred Shares may also be redeemed before the redemption date at a redemption price of   $25,000   per Series A Preferred Share (equivalent to   $25   per Depositary Share), plus declared and unpaid dividends, in whole, if there is a change in tax law, or in whole or in part, in the case of a capital disqualification event. 
  Dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares, when, as and if declared by the Company s Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, will accrue and be payable on the liquidation preference amount from the original issue date, on a non-cumulative basis, quarterly in arrears on each dividend payment date at an annual rate of   5.875%  . The Company will be restricted from paying dividends on and repurchasing its common shares, unless certain dividend payments are made on the Series A Preferred Shares. 
  Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the Series A Preferred Shares and any parity shares are entitled to receive out of our assets available for distribution to shareholders, before any distribution is made to holders of common shares or other junior shares, a liquidating distribution in the amount of   $25,000   per Series A Preferred Share (equivalent to   $25   per Depositary Share) plus declared and unpaid dividends. Distributions will be made pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of the Series A Preferred Shares and any parity shares and only to the extent of our assets, if any, that are available after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors. 
  Holders of the Series A Preferred Shares have no voting rights, except with respect to certain fundamental changes in the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares and in the case of certain dividend non-payments or as otherwise required by Bermuda law or the Company s bye-laws. 
  The following table is a summary of the Preferred shares issued and outstanding:

    Common Shares 
     The holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends and are allocated   one vote per share  , provided that, if the controlled shares of any shareholder or group of related shareholders constitute more than   9.09   percent of the outstanding common shares of the Company, their voting power will be reduced to   9.09   percent. 
  The Company may from time to time repurchase its securities, including common shares, Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures and Senior Notes. On February 3, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the Company's common share purchase authorization to   $750,000  . This amount is in addition to the   $2,274,401   of common shares repurchased by the Company through February 3, 2015 under its previously authorized share repurchase programs.  
  The Company has repurchased   80,191,448   common shares for an aggregate purchase price of   $2,687,746   from the inception of its share repurchase program to   September 30, 2016  . The Company had   $336,655   remaining under its authorized share repurchase program as at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company expects the purchases under its share repurchase program to be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, form and amount of the share repurchases under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, the Company s capital position relative to internal and rating agency targets, legal requirements and other factors. The repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. 
  The following table is a summary of the common share activity during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   :

12.   Stock plans 
           (a) 
    Long Term Incentive Plan  
     The Company s Amended and Restated 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ) provides for grants to employees of options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted shares, restricted share units, performance shares, dividend equivalents or other share-based awards. The total number of shares reserved for issuance under the LTIP are   2,753,292   shares of which   1,258,962   shares remain available for issuance at   September 30, 2016  . The LTIP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. No SARs have been granted to date. Grant prices are established at the fair market value of the Company s common shares at the date of grant. 
           i. 
    Options 
     Options may be exercised for voting common shares upon vesting. Outstanding options have a life of   10 years   and vest either pro rata or at the end of the required service period from the date of grant. Fair value of the option awards at the date of grant is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  
  Expected volatility is based on stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies. The Company used the simplified method consistent with U.S. GAAP authoritative guidance on stock compensation expenses to estimate expected lives for options granted during the period as historical exercise data was not available and the options met the requirement as set out in the guidance. 
  The Company has not granted any stock option awards since September 4, 2009. These stock option awards were fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2012. 
  Activity with respect to options for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 was as follows: 

ii. 
    Restricted share awards 
     Restricted shares granted under the LTIP vest either pro rata or at the end of the required service period and contain certain restrictions during the vesting period, relating to, among other things, forfeiture in the event of termination of employment and transferability. The Company recognized share compensation expenses during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $9,159   (  2015  :   $9,081  ) and   $27,805   (2015:   $26,213  ), respectively. The expenses represent the proportionate accrual of the fair value of each grant based on the remaining vesting period. 
  Activity with respect to unvested restricted share awards for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 was as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $67,472   (  December 31, 2015  :   $69,143  ) of total unrecognized share compensation expenses in respect of restricted share awards that are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.4 years   (  December 31, 2015  :   2.4 years  ).

iii. 
    Restricted share units 
     Restricted share units under the LTIP vest either ratably or at the end of the required service period and contain certain restrictions during the vesting period, relating to, among other things, forfeiture in the event of termination of employment and transferability. The Company recognized share compensation expenses during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $290   (  2015  :   $310  ) and $  978   (2015:   $851  ), respectively. The expenses represent the proportionate accrual of the fair value of each grant based on the remaining vesting period. 
  Activity with respect to unvested restricted share units for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 was as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $2,526   (  December 31, 2015  :   $2,790  ) of total unrecognized share compensation expenses in respect of restricted share units that are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.5 years   (  December 31, 2015  :   2.6 years  ). 
           iv. 
    Performance share awards 
     The performance share awards contain a performance based component. The performance component relates to the compounded growth in the Dividend Adjusted Diluted Book Value per Share ( DBVPS ) over a   three  -year period relative to the Company's peer group. For performance share awards granted during the period, the grant date DBVPS is based on the DBVPS at the end of the most recent financial reporting year. The Dividend Adjusted Performance Period End DBVPS will be the DBVPS three years after the grant date DBVPS.

    Funds at Lloyd's  
     Talbot operates in Lloyd s through a corporate member, Talbot 2002 Underwriting Capital Ltd ( T02 ), which is the sole participant in Syndicate 1183.

Such capital, called Funds at Lloyd s, comprises cash and investments. The Company provided FAL in the amount of   $617,000   for the   2016   underwriting year (  2015   underwriting year:   $595,100  ).

The Company does not believe that any assessment is likely in the foreseeable future and has not provided any allowance for such an assessment. However, based on the Company's   2016     underwriting capacity at Lloyd's of    600,000  , at the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate of    1 equals $1.2983   and assuming the maximum   3%   assessment, the Company would be assessed approximately   $23,369  .

18.   Segment information    
  The Company conducts its operations worldwide through   four   operating segments, which have been determined under U.S. GAAP segment reporting to be Validus Re, Talbot, Western World and AlphaCat. The Company s operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are managed and have capital allocated separately because each segment requires different strategies.  A description of each of the Company's operating segments and its corporate and investments function is as follows: 
  Validus Re Segment 
  The Validus Re segment is focused on treaty reinsurance. The primary lines in which the segment conducts business are property, marine and specialty which includes agriculture, aerospace and aviation, financial lines of business, nuclear, terrorism, life, accident   health, workers  compensation, crisis management, contingency, technical lines, composite, trade credit and casualty. 
  Talbot Segment 
  The Talbot segment is focused on a wide range of marine and energy, political lines, commercial property, financial lines, contingency, accident   health and aviation classes of business on an insurance or facultative reinsurance basis and principally property, aerospace and marine classes of business on a treaty reinsurance basis. 
  Western World Segment 
  The Western World segment is focused on providing commercial insurance products on a surplus lines and specialty admitted basis. Western World specializes in underwriting classes of business that are not easily placed in the standard insurance market due to their complexity, high hazard, or unusual nature; including general liability, property and professional liability classes of business.  
  AlphaCat Segment 
  The AlphaCat segment leverages the Company s underwriting and analytical expertise and earns management and performance fees from the Company and other third party investors primarily through the AlphaCat ILS funds and sidecars.  
  Corporate and Investments 
  The Company has a corporate and investments function ("Corporate"), which includes the activities of the parent company, and which carries out certain functions for the group, including investment management. Corporate includes investment income on a managed basis and other non-segment expenses, predominantly general and administrative, stock compensation and finance expenses. Corporate also denotes the activities of certain key executives such as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. For internal reporting purposes, Corporate is reflected separately; however, Corporate is not considered an operating segment under these circumstances. Other reconciling items include, but are not limited to, the elimination of certain inter segment revenues and expenses and other items that are not allocated to the operating segments.  
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company made certain changes in its presentation of segment information. The changes were made to present the results of Validus Re, Talbot and Western World on an underwriting income basis and the results of AlphaCat on an asset manager basis. Investment results, foreign exchange, other income (loss), finance expenses and income taxes are now presented on a consolidated basis, reflecting how the Company operationally manages these areas. The Company's assets primarily comprise cash and investments which are managed on a consolidated basis; accordingly, the Company's assets have not been presented on a segmental basis. The presentation changes have not had an effect on the reportable income or loss to any of the operating segments and all prior period disclosures have been revised to conform to current period presentation. 
  Underwriting income and the AlphaCat asset manager view are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of segmental income to net income available to Validus is included in the tables below.

Executive Overview 
  Validus Holdings, Ltd. (the "Company" or "Validus Holdings") conducts its operations worldwide through four operating segments which have been determined under U.S. GAAP segment reporting to be Validus Re, Talbot, Western World, and AlphaCat.  A summary of each of the Company's operating segments is as follows: 
     Validus Re is a Bermuda-based reinsurance segment focused on treaty reinsurance;  
     Talbot is a specialty insurance segment, primarily operating within the Lloyd's insurance market through Syndicate 1183;  
             
    Western World is a U.S. based specialty excess and surplus lines insurance segment operating within the U.S. commercial market; and  
                
    AlphaCat is a Bermuda based investment adviser managing capital for third parties and the Company in insurance linked securities and other property catastrophe and specialty reinsurance investments.  
     In addition, the Company has a corporate and investment function ("Corporate"), which includes the activities of the parent company, and which carries out certain functions for the group, including investment management. Corporate includes investment income on a managed basis and other non-segment expenses, predominantly general and administrative, stock compensation and finance expenses. The Company's corporate expenses, capital servicing and debt costs and investment results are presented separately within the corporate and investment function discussion.  
  The Company s strategy is to concentrate primarily on short-tail risks, which has been an area where management believes prices and terms provide an attractive risk-adjusted return and the management team has proven expertise. The Company s profitability in any given period is a function of net earned premium and investment revenues, less net losses and loss expenses, acquisition expenses and operating expenses. The Company's insurance and reinsurance portfolio, as measured by gross premium written, was comprised of   37%   insurance and   63%   reinsurance for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (  2015  :   39%   insurance and   61%   reinsurance), compared to 46% insurance and 54% reinsurance for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in portfolio composition was driven primarily by the seasonality of reinsurance renewals. Financial results in the insurance and reinsurance industry are influenced by the frequency and/or severity of claims and losses, including as a result of catastrophic events; changes in interest rates, financial markets and general economic conditions; the supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity and changes in legal, regulatory and judicial environments. 
   
  Business Outlook and Trends 
  The Company underwrites global property insurance and reinsurance and has large aggregate exposures to natural and man-made disasters. The occurrence of claims from catastrophic events results in substantial volatility, and can have material adverse effects on the Company s financial condition and results along with its ability to write new business. This volatility affects results for the period in which the loss occurs because U.S. accounting principles do not permit reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur. Catastrophic events of significant magnitude have historically been relatively infrequent, although management believes the property catastrophe reinsurance market has experienced a higher level of worldwide catastrophic losses in terms of both frequency and severity in the period from 1992 to the present. The Company also expects that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future. The Company seeks to reflect these types of trends when pricing contracts. 
  Property and other reinsurance premiums have historically risen in the aftermath of significant catastrophic losses. As loss reserves are established, industry surplus is depleted and the industry s capacity to write new business diminishes. The global property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry has historically been highly cyclical. Since 2007, increased capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of capital by existing insurers and reinsurers increased the supply of insurance and reinsurance which resulted in a softening of rates on most lines. From 2010 to 2012, there was an increased level of catastrophe activity, principally the Chilean earthquake, Deepwater Horizon, the Tohoku earthquake, the New Zealand earthquakes and Superstorm Sandy, but the Company continues to see increased competition and decreased premium rates in most classes of business. In the absence of significant catastrophes in recent years, the market supply of capital is greater than the demand and therefore the Company expects to see continued pressure on rates in the near term.  
  During the January 2016 renewal season, the Validus Re and AlphaCat segments in total underwrote $610.5 million in gross premiums written (excluding U.S. agriculture premiums and net of intercompany eliminations between Validus Re and AlphaCat), an increase of 12.9% from the prior year renewal period. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in AlphaCat AUM and new business in the casualty and specialty lines, partially offset by non-renewed business in the property and marine lines due to rate reductions. The U.S. property lines experienced rate declines in the low single-digits, while rate declines in the international property lines were more challenging, with rates down closer to 10%. The marine lines experienced rate declines in the mid-single digits due to the worldwide reduction in oil prices. During the mid-year 2016 renewal period, the U.S. property market saw a  
  
   63 

     Table of Contents  

continuation of the rate trend observed at the January 2016 renewals where rate declines were in the low single-digits. However, the rate environment in the international property market proved to be more challenging as market participants actively pursued diversification of exposure, often at the expense of profit, which resulted in average rate reductions of about 10%. 
  Business written by the Talbot and Western World segments is distributed more evenly throughout the year. Through   September 30, 2016  , the Talbot segment experienced a whole account rate decrease of approximately 6.1% driven primarily by decreases in energy and political lines. The Western World segment experienced a modest whole account rate increase of approximately 0.8% through   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Financial Measures 
  Key Financial Indicators 
  The Company believes that the key financial indicator for evaluating our performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for its shareholders is book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends.  
  Book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends, together with other key book value financial indicators, are shown in the table below: 

(a) 
    These are non-GAAP financial measures which are described in the section entitled    Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
     Book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends   is considered by management to be the key financial indicator of performance, as the Company believes growth in book value on a diluted basis, plus the dividends that have accumulated, ultimately translates into the return that a shareholder will receive. Book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends is calculated based on total shareholders  equity available to Validus excluding the   $150.0 million   liquidation value of the preferred shares, plus the assumed proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, divided by the sum of common shares, unvested restricted shares and options and warrants outstanding (assuming their exercise), plus accumulated dividends. 
  Book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends     increased   by   $3.88  , or   7.4%  , from   $52.49   at   December 31, 2015   to   $56.37   at   September 30, 2016  . Cash dividends per common share are an integral part of the value created for shareholders. The Company has paid cash dividends of   $1.05   per common share during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Book value per diluted common share   is considered by management to be a measure of returns to common shareholders, as the Company believes growth in book value on a diluted basis ultimately translates into growth in stock price.  
  Book value per diluted common share after dividends paid   increased   by   $2.83  , or   6.7%  , from   $42.33   at   December 31, 2015   to   $45.16   at   September 30, 2016  . Growth in book value per diluted common share inclusive of dividends was   2.5%   and   1.9%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   9.2%   and   8.1%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. All outstanding warrants expired on December 12, 2015 and no further warrants are anticipated to be issued. 
  Tangible book value per diluted common share   is considered by management to be a measure of returns to common shareholders excluding intangible assets and goodwill, as the Company believes growth in tangible book value on a diluted basis ultimately translates into growth in the tangible value of the Company. Tangible book value per diluted common share is calculated based on total shareholders  equity available to Validus excluding the   $150.0 million   liquidation value of the preferred shares, less goodwill and intangible assets, plus the assumed proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants; divided by the sum of common shares, unvested restricted shares, options and warrants outstanding (assuming their exercise).  
  Tangible book value per diluted common share   increased   by   $2.72  , or   7.0%  , from   $38.63   at   December 31, 2015   to   $41.35   at   September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

Other Financial Indicators 
  The Company believes that the following other financial indicators are beneficial in evaluating our performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for shareholders: 

(a) 
    This is a non-GAAP financial measure which is described in the section entitled    Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
     Underwriting income   measures the performance of the Company s core underwriting function, excluding revenues and expenses such as net investment income, finance expenses, tax (expense) benefit, income (loss) from operating affiliates, (income) attributable to AlphaCat investors, net realized and change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments, income (loss) from investment affiliate, foreign exchange gains (losses), other income (loss), non-recurring items and net (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest. The Company believes the reporting of underwriting income enhances the understanding of results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the Company s core insurance and reinsurance operations.  
  Underwriting income was   $99.9 million   and   $90.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $301.8 million   and   $344.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Net operating income available to Validus common shareholders   is defined as net income (loss) excluding net realized and change in net unrealized gains (losses) on investments, income (loss) from investment affiliate, foreign exchange gains (losses), other income (loss), non-recurring items, operating (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest and dividends on preferred shares. This measure focuses on the underlying fundamentals of the Company's operations without the influence of gains (losses) from the sale of investments, translation of non-U.S. dollar currencies, non-recurring items, (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest and dividends on preferred shares.  
  Net operating income available to Validus common shareholders was   $82.6 million   and   $65.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $254.9 million   and   $304.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Annualized return on average equity   represents the return generated on common shareholders  equity during the period. Annualized return on average equity is calculated by dividing the net income available to Validus common shareholders for the period by the average shareholders  equity available to Validus during the period. Average shareholders  equity is the average of the beginning, ending and intervening quarter end shareholders  equity balances, excluding the   $150.0 million   liquidation value of the preferred shares. The Company s objective is to generate superior returns on capital that appropriately reward shareholders for the risks assumed.  
  The annualized return on average equity was   9.7%   and   7.3%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   12.7%   and   11.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Annualized net operating return on average equity   represents the net operating return generated on common shareholders  equity during the period. Annualized net operating return on average equity is calculated by dividing the net operating income available to Validus common shareholders for the period by the average shareholders  equity available to Validus during the period. Average shareholders  equity is the average of the beginning, ending and intervening quarter end shareholders  equity balances, excluding the   $150.0 million   liquidation value of the preferred shares.  
  The annualized net operating return on average equity was   8.9%   and   7.2%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   9.2%   and   11.1%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Third   Quarter   2016   Summarized Results of Operations - Consolidated 
  Highlights for the   third   quarter 2016 as compared to 2015 were as follows: 
              
    Gross premiums written for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   in the Talbot segment were   $189.7 million   compared to   $226.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease   of   $36.4 million   or   16.1%  . The decrease was primarily driven as a result of foreign exchange and the timing of renewals and current market conditions and was partially offset by an increase in premium estimates; 
                
    Gross premiums written for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   in the Validus Re segment were   $94.7 million   compared to   $103.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease   of   $8.6 million   or   8.3%  . The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease across the property and marine classes due to the timing of renewals and current market conditions; and, 
                
    Gross premiums written in the AlphaCat segment, on behalf of the Company's variable interest entities ("VIEs"), were   $4.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $9.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease   of   $5.5 million   or   55.4%  ; partially offset by, 
                
    Gross premiums written for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   in the Western World segment were   $85.3 million   compared to   $70.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an increase   of   $14.4 million   or   20.3%  , primarily as a result of continued enhancements to the underwriting platform in short tail lines. 
       Notable and Non-notable Loss Events 
             
    The Company defines a notable loss event as an event whereby consolidated net losses and loss expenses aggregate to a threshold greater than or equal to $30.0 million.  
                
    The Company defines a non-notable loss event as an event whereby consolidated net losses and loss expenses aggregate to a threshold greater than or equal to $15.0 million but less than $30.0 million. 

For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , losses and loss expenses from the Canadian Wildfires second quarter 2016 notable loss event were   $1.0 million  , or   0.2   percentage points of the loss ratio.  
                
    For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , losses and loss expenses from non-notable loss events were   $21.6 million  , or   3.8   percentage points of the loss ratio. Losses and loss expenses related to SpaceX, the September 1   st    rocket explosion at Cape Canaveral, Florida, were   $20.2 million  , or 3.6 percentage points of the loss ratio. Net of reinstatement premiums of   $1.2 million  , the net loss attributable to the Company from this event was   $19.0 million  . In addition, losses and loss expenses of   $1.4 million  , or 0.2 percentage points of the loss ratio, related to the Texas Hailstorms second quarter 2016 non-notable loss event.

     Table of Contents  

During the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred losses and loss expenses from two notable loss events; the August 12   th    port explosion in Tianjin, China and Pemex, a second quarter 2015 event, and one non-notable loss event, the 2015 Chilean earthquake.   
                
    The two notable loss events resulted in net losses and loss expenses to the Company of   $49.0 million  , or   8.8   percentage points of the loss ratio. Net of $3.9 million of reinstatement premiums, the effect of these events on the Company's underwriting income was a reduction of $45.1 million. Losses and loss expenses from the non-notable loss event were   $22.2 million  , or   4.0   percentage points of the loss ratio. Net of $2.2 million of reinstatement premiums, the effect of this event on the Company's underwriting income was a reduction of $20.0 million. 
     Loss Ratios 
             
    For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the loss ratio across all lines of business was   45.8%   which included   favorable   loss reserve development on prior accident years of   $52.9 million  , benefiting the loss ratio by   9.4   percentage points. The   favorable   loss reserve development on prior accident years of   $52.9 million   was primarily due to favorable development of attritional losses of $32.6 million and favorable development on event specific reserves of $20.3 million, primarily related to Tianjin and the 2015 Chilean earthquake. The term "events" refers to aggregate notable and non-notable losses incurred. 
                
    For the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , the loss ratio across all lines of business was   46.1%   which included   favorable   loss reserve development on prior accident years of   $93.7 million  , benefiting the loss ratio by   16.9   percentage points. The favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years of   $93.7 million   was primarily due to favorable development of attritional losses of $63.9 million and favorable development on event specific reserves of $29.8 million, primarily related to Superstorm Sandy.  
                 
    Loss ratios by line of business for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Policy acquisition costs   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $113.4 million   compared to   $105.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an increase   of   $8.4 million   or   8.0%  .  The year on year increase was primarily related to the amortization of the Western World acquisition date fair value adjustments which reduced the ratio during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
                
    Underwriting income   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $99.9 million   compared to   $90.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   an increase   of   $9.3 million   or   10.3%   primarily as a result of the changes in underwriting revenues and deductions described above.

Gross Premiums Written 

The   decrease   in gross premiums written in the property lines of   $11.6 million   was primarily due to reductions in our participation and non-renewals on various programs due to the current rate environment and adjustments to existing business. The   decrease   in gross premiums written in the marine lines of   $17.9 million   was primarily due to the timing of renewals of certain proportional programs which incepted during the third quarter of 2015, as well as downwards premium adjustments on various proportional contracts. Gross premiums written in the specialty lines increased by   $21.0 million   primarily as a result of new casualty business written during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $7.5 million  , timing differences on the renewal of certain contracts and decreased downwards premium adjustments year on year. 
  Reinsurance Premiums Ceded 

Reinsurance premiums ceded in the marine lines decreased by   $4.4 million   and specialty lines increased by   $5.3 million  , primarily due to a reclassification of composite business from specialty lines to marine lines during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Selected Underwriting Ratios 
  The underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are often measured by reference to its combined ratio, which is the sum of the losses and loss expense ratio and the expense ratio. The losses and loss expense ratio is calculated by dividing losses and loss expenses incurred (including estimates for incurred but not reported losses) by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is calculated by dividing acquisition costs combined with general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned.  
  The following table presents a comparison of the losses and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition cost ratio, general and administrative expense ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Gross Premiums Written 

Talbot gross premiums written for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   translated at   2015   exchange rates would have been $196.8 million, a decrease of $29.2 million on the prior year period. 
  The decrease in gross premiums written in the property and marine lines of   $8.4 million   and   $18.7 million  , respectively, were primarily driven by the impact of foreign exchange and reductions in our participation and non-renewals on various programs due to the current rate environment, notably in the downstream and upstream energy classes. The   decrease   in gross premiums written in the specialty lines of   $9.2 million   was primarily due to reductions in our participation and the timing of renewals of various aviation direct and political lines contracts. 
  Reinsurance Premiums Ceded 

The   decrease   in reinsurance premiums ceded in the property lines of   $6.6 million   was primarily driven by a reduction in quota share movements along with a reduction in purchased reinsurance on certain of treaty layers. The   decrease   in reinsurance premiums ceded in the marine and specialty lines of   $3.1 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively, was primarily due to a reduction in reinstatement premiums during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .

  Foreign Exchange Losses 
  The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar.

The Company's largest foreign currency fluctuation exposure is to the following currencies, with the movement in each currency against the U.S. dollar for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   shown in the table below: 

Foreign exchange losses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $1.1 million   compared to   $2.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , a favorable movement of   $1.3 million  . 
  The Company currently hedges foreign currency exposure by substantively balancing assets (primarily cash and premium receivables) with liabilities (primarily case reserves and event IBNR) for certain major non-U.S. dollar currencies, or by entering into forward foreign currency contracts. Consequently, the Company aims to have a limited exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.

The Texas Hailstorms and Kumamoto Earthquake non-notable loss events impacted Talbot's property lines by   $5.6 million  , while the Jubilee Oil and SpaceX non-notable loss events impacted Talbot's marine lines by   $14.7 million  .  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , losses and loss expenses from the Chilean earthquake non-notable loss event were   $4.7 million  , or   0.7   percentage points of the loss ratio and impacted Talbot's property and marine lines.

  Property Lines 

Excluding the impact of notable and non-notable loss events and the change in prior accident years, the current period loss ratio for property lines   increased   by   1.0   percentage point, representing a higher level of attritional losses incurred during the period. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the   favorable   development in losses and loss expenses on prior accident years of   $31.0 million   included favorable development on event reserves of $9.2 million and attritional losses of $21.8 million; whereas the   favorable   development for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $47.1 million   included favorable development on attritional losses of $38.9 million and event reserves of $8.2 million, including the Thailand floods, which was a 2011 notable loss event. 
  The impact on Talbot of the notable and non-notable loss events for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , is described above.

     Table of Contents  

Excluding the impact of notable and non-notable loss events and the change in prior accident years, the current period loss ratio for marine lines   decreased   by   1.7   percentage points, primarily due to the decrease in net premiums earned during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as noted above. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the   favorable   development in losses and loss expenses on prior accident years of   $10.5 million   was comprised of favorable development of attritional losses of $29.1 million, partially offset by adverse development of $18.6 million on prior year events. The adverse development was driven by reserves established following the receipt of a loss advice on an individual marine policy that incepted during the second half of 2015. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the   favorable   development in losses and loss expenses for prior accident years  of   $51.2 million   was primarily due to favorable development of attritional losses. 
  The impact on Talbot of the notable and non-notable loss events for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , is described above. 
  Specialty Lines 

Excluding the impact of notable and non-notable loss events and the change in prior accident years, the current period loss ratio for specialty lines   increased   by   4.6   percentage points, representing a higher level of attritional losses in the current period. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the favorable development in losses and loss expenses on prior accident years  of   $28.3 million   and   $24.9 million  , respectively, was primarily due to favorable development of attritional losses.

Policy Acquisition Costs   

  Policy acquisition costs across all classes were consistent with the earning pattern of net premiums written during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Underwriting Income Before General and Administrative and Share Compensation Expenses   

  The changes in underwriting income before general and administrative and share compensation expenses are driven by factors highlighted above in respect of gross premiums written, reinsurance premiums ceded, losses and loss expenses and policy acquisition costs.  
  General and Administrative and Share Compensation Expenses   

  General and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   translated at   2015   exchange rates would have been $118.9 million, an increase of $3.6 million. This increase was primarily due to a greater retention of costs within the segment and an increase in Lloyd's related costs and was partially offset by reduced accruals relating to performance bonuses. Share compensation expenses were comparable for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Gross Premiums Written   

  The property lines consist largely of commercial package property, program and brokerage business. The   increase   in gross premiums written in the property lines of   $26.3 million   was primarily due to increases in the brokerage property, contract commercial package and monoline property and program flood classes of $9.4 million, $8.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively, as a result of the continued build out of the underwriting platform in short tail lines. Gross premiums written in the liability lines consist largely of commercial package liability, program and other liability business. The   increase   in gross premiums written in the liability lines of   $2.6 million   was driven by increases in the contract liability and brokerage professional lines of $11.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively, and was partially offset by decreases arising from the discontinuation of underperforming programs and brokerage general liability lines.  
  Reinsurance Premiums Ceded   

  Reinsurance premiums ceded in the property lines were driven by the factors highlighted above in respect of gross premiums written for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The decrease in reinsurance premiums ceded in the liability lines was primarily due to the discontinuation of underperforming programs and brokerage general liability lines which were ceded at a higher rate. 
  Net Premiums Written   

  Net premiums written and the net retention ratio were driven by the factors highlighted above in respect of gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded.

Net Premiums Earned   

  Net premiums earned in the property lines during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were driven by the factors highlighted above in respect of gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded. Net premiums earned in the liability lines during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   have decreased primarily as a result of the discontinuation of liability lines as discussed above. Net premiums earned exceeded net premiums written for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as Western World discontinued writing business in several underperforming classes during the three months ended December 31, 2014, including binding authority commercial auto business, a large bar and tavern program and certain brokerage general liability habitational accounts. 
  Losses and Loss Expenses   

(a) 
    Upon closing the acquisition, an adjustment of $15,586 was made to increase net reserves to reflect fair value. This adjustment was amortized to income through a reduction in losses and loss expenses of $8,639 during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , benefiting the loss ratio by 4.4 percentage points. The remaining fair value adjustment of $2,340 was fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     Notable Loss Events 
  There were no notable loss events for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  Non-notable Loss Events 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , losses and loss expenses from the Texas Hailstorm non-notable loss event were   $0.6 million  , or   0.3   percentage points of the loss ratio which solely impacted Western World's property lines. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , there were no non-notable loss events.

    Upon closing the acquisition, an adjustment of $409 was made to decrease net reserves to reflect fair value. This adjustment was amortized to income through an increase in losses and loss expenses of $227 during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , increasing the loss ratio by 0.7 percentage points. The remaining fair value adjustment of $61 was fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2015.  
       
  Excluding the impact of non-notable loss events and the change in prior accident years, the current period loss ratio for property lines   decreased   by   5.4   percentage points, primarily as a result of the increase in net premiums earned during the period. Included as part of current period losses and loss expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are $11.5 million, or 26.7 percentage points of the property lines loss ratio, of losses from other U.S.-based weather events including floods. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the favorable development on prior accident years of   $2.6 million   and   $4.6 million  , respectively, primarily related to favorable development on attritional losses.

(a) 
    Upon closing the acquisition, an adjustment of $15,995 was made to increase net reserves to reflect fair value. This adjustment was amortized to income through a reduction in losses and loss expenses of $8,866 during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , benefiting the loss ratio by 5.4 percentage points. The remaining fair value adjustment of $2,401 was fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2015. 
       
  Excluding the change in prior accident years, the current period loss ratio for liability lines   decreased   by   9.4   percentage points as Western World discontinued writing business in several underperforming classes during the fourth quarter of 2014.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the favorable development in losses and loss expenses on prior accident years of   $5.9 million   was due to favorable development on attritional losses; whereas the favorable development of   $11.0 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was primarily due to the amortization of the fair value adjustment, as noted in footnote (a) above and favorable development on attritional losses. 
  Policy Acquisition Costs   

           (a) 
    Upon closing the acquisition, an adjustment of $34,736 was made to reduce deferred acquisition costs to reflect fair value. These deferred acquisition costs would otherwise have been expensed in the amount of $19,917 during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , benefiting the policy acquisition cost ratio by 10.1 percentage points. 
     The acquisition cost ratio for the property and liability lines increased by   12.3   and   9.3   percentage points, respectively, primarily due to the impact of the acquisition fair value adjustments during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   as noted in footnote (a) above.

     Managed Net Investment Income   

  The   increase   in managed net investment income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $14.6 million  , or   16.0%  , was primarily due to increased yield on a certain investment fund within other investments. Managed net investment income from other investments includes distributed and undistributed net income from certain investment funds.  
  The Company's managed yield-bearing portfolio had an annualized effective yield of      2.24%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   1.92%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , an   increase   of   32   basis points. Investment yield is calculated by dividing total managed net investment income by the average balance of the yield bearing assets managed by the Company's portfolio managers.

The increase was primarily due to increased performance share award grants. 
  Finance Expenses 
  Finance expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $42.6 million   compared to   $45.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease   of   $3.0 million   or   6.5%  . The decrease was primarily due to reduced credit facility expenses. 
  Net Realized and Change in Net Unrealized Gains on Investments 
  Net realized gains on managed investments for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $5.5 million   compared to   $5.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $0.5 million  . 
  The change in net unrealized gains on managed investments for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $81.8 million   compared to   $2.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $79.3 million  . The increase was primarily due to the impact of declining interest rates on our fixed maturity investments during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  (Loss) Income from Investment Affiliate 
  The (loss) income from investment affiliate relates to the income earned from the Company's investments in Aquiline Financial Services Fund II L.P. and Fund III L.P. For further details, refer to Note   6  ,   "Investments in affiliates,"   to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. 
  Foreign Exchange Gains (Losses)  
  The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. As a significant portion of the Company's operations are transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may affect year-to-year comparisons. The Company's largest foreign currency fluctuation exposure is to the following currencies, with the movement in each currency against the U.S. dollar for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   shown in the table below: 

Foreign exchange gains for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $11.6 million   compared to losses of   $9.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a favorable movement of   $20.7 million  , The foreign exchange gains for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were primarily attributable to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the British Pound sterling. 
  The Company currently hedges foreign currency exposure by substantively balancing assets (primarily cash and premium receivables) with liabilities (primarily case reserves and event IBNR) for certain major non-U.S. dollar currencies, or by entering into forward foreign currency contracts. Consequently, the Company aims to have a limited exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  The operating results of an insurance or reinsurance company are also often measured by reference to its underwriting income and net operating income, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Underwriting income and net operating income available to Validus common shareholders, as set out in the table below, is reconciled to net income available to Validus common shareholders (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) by the addition or subtraction of certain Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income line items, as illustrated below.  

The Company uses underwriting income as a primary measure of underwriting results in its analysis of historical financial information and when performing its budgeting and forecasting processes. Analysts, investors and rating agencies who follow the Company request this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis. In addition, underwriting income is one of the factors considered by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors in determining the total annual incentive compensation.  
  Underwriting income is the primary financial measure for the Company's insurance and reinsurance operating segments: Validus Re, Talbot and Western World. The results of the AlphaCat operating segment are presented on an asset manager basis, which is also non-GAAP. Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note   18  , "  Segment information  ," for a reconciliation of the Company's share of AlphaCat segment income to segmental income. 
  Net operating income available to Validus common shareholders indicates the performance of the Company s core underwriting function and includes net investment income, finance expenses, tax (expense) benefit, income (loss) from operating affiliates and (income) attributable to AlphaCat investors and excludes net operating (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest, dividends on preferred shares and certain other revenues and expenses such as the reconciling items in the table above. The Company believes the reporting of   net operating income available to Validus common shareholders   enhances the understanding of results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the Company s core insurance and reinsurance business. This profitability is influenced significantly by earned premium growth, adequacy of the Company s pricing and loss frequency and severity. Over time it is also influenced by the Company s underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio, which it accomplishes through its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. 
  The Company excludes the U.S. GAAP measures noted above, in particular net realized and change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments, from its calculation of   net operating income available to Validus common shareholders   because the amount of these gains and losses is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part, according to availability of investment market opportunities. The Company believes these amounts are largely independent of its core underwriting activities and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations. In addition to presenting net income available to Validus common shareholders determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company believes that showing underwriting income and   net operating income available to Validus common shareholders   provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability and enables investors, analysts, rating agencies

     Table of Contents  

and other users of its financial information to more easily analyze the Company s results in a manner similar to how management analyzes the Company s underlying business performance.  
  Underwriting income and   net operating income available to Validus common shareholders   should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income available to Validus common shareholders as there are inherent material limitations associated with the use of underwriting income and   net operating income available to Validus common shareholders   as compared to using net income available to Validus common shareholders, which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. The most significant limitation is the ability of users of the financial information to make comparable assessments of underwriting income and operating income with other companies, particularly as these measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. Therefore, the Company provides prominence in this filing to the use of the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income available to Validus common shareholders, which includes the reconciling items in the table above. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing both clear and transparent disclosure of net income available to Validus common shareholders and reconciliation of underwriting income and   net operating income available to Validus common shareholders   to net income available to Validus common shareholders. 
  In presenting the Company's results, management has also included and discussed certain schedules containing book value and tangible book value per diluted common share and book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  
  Such measures described above which are referred to as non-GAAP, may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Investments 
  Managed investments represent assets governed by the Company s investment policy statement ( IPS ) whereas, non-managed investments represent assets held in support of consolidated AlphaCat VIEs which are not governed by the Company s IPS. Refer to Note   5  ,   "  Variable interest entities  ,"   to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 for further details.  
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company's managed cash and investment portfolio totaled   $6.5 billion   (  December 31, 2015  :   $6.4 billion  ). Refer to Note   3  ,   "  Investments  ,    to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 for further details related to the Company's managed investments. 
  A significant portion of (re)insurance contracts written by the Company provide short-tail reinsurance coverage for losses resulting mainly from natural and man-made catastrophes, which could result in payment of a substantial amount of losses at short notice. Accordingly, the Company s investment portfolio is primarily structured to provide liquidity, which means the investment portfolio contains a significant amount of relatively short-term fixed maturity investments. The Company s IPS specifically requires certain minimum thresholds of cash, short-term investments, and highly-rated fixed maturity securities relative to our consolidated net reserves and estimates of probable maximum loss exposures at the 1 in 100 year threshold to provide necessary liquidity in a wide range of reasonable scenarios. As such, the Company structures its managed cash and investment portfolio to support policyholder reserves and contingent risk exposures with a liquid portfolio of high quality fixed-income investments with a comparable duration profile. 
  The Company s IPS requires managed investments to have an average duration in the range of 0.75 years to 3.00 years. At   September 30, 2016  , the average duration of the Company s managed investment portfolio was   2.29   years (  December 31, 2015  :   2.15   years). This duration is reviewed regularly based on changes in the duration of the Company's liabilities and in general market conditions.  
  The Company s IPS also requires certain minimum credit quality standards for its managed fixed maturity portfolio, including a minimum weighted average portfolio rating of A+ for securities assigned ratings. Further limits on asset classes and security types are also mandated. In addition, the Company stress-tests the downside risks within its asset portfolio using internal and external inputs and stochastic modeling processes to help define and limit asset risks to acceptable levels that are consistent with our overall ERM framework. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s rated managed fixed maturity portfolio had an average credit quality rating of   AA-   (  December 31, 2015  :   AA-  ). 
  The value of the Company s managed fixed maturity portfolio will fluctuate with, among other factors, changes in the interest rate environment and in overall economic conditions. Additionally, the structure of the Company s overall managed investment portfolio exposes the Company to other risks, including insolvency or reduced credit quality of corporate debt securities, prepayment, default and structural risks on asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and bank loans and liquidity risks on certain other investments, including hedge funds, investment funds and private equity investments. For further details on market risks, refer to

As part of the ongoing risk management process, the Company monitors the aggregation of country or jurisdiction risk exposure. Jurisdiction risk exposure is the risk that events within a jurisdiction, such as currency crises, regulatory changes and other political events, will adversely affect the ability of obligors within the jurisdiction to honor their obligations. The following table provides a breakdown of the fair value of jurisdiction risk exposures outside the United States within the Company s managed fixed maturity portfolio: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have an aggregate exposure to any single issuer of more than   0.9%   of total yield bearing assets, other than with respect to government and agency securities. The top ten exposures to fixed income corporate issuers at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

(a) 
    Issuers exclude government-backed government-sponsored enterprises and cash and cash equivalents. 
              (b) 
    Investment ratings are the median of Moody's, Standard   Poor's and Fitch. For investments where three ratings are unavailable, the lower of the ratings shall apply. All investment ratings are presented as the Standard   Poor's equivalent rating. 
              (c) 
    Credit exposures represent only direct exposure to fixed maturities and short-term investments of the parent issuer and its major subsidiaries. These exposures exclude asset and mortgage backed securities that were issued, sponsored or serviced by the parent.

Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses 
  At September 30, 2016  , gross and net reserves for losses and loss expenses were estimated using the methodology as outlined in Part II, Item 7, "  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  " in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   The following tables show the breakdown of the Company's gross and net reserves for losses and loss expenses by line of business and split between case reserves and IBNR.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of gross and net reserves for losses and loss expenses by operating segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 

The amount of recorded reserves represents management s best estimate of expected losses and loss expenses on premiums earned. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years was   $52.9 million   of which   $33.0 million   related to the Validus Re segment,   $18.7 million   related to the Talbot segment,   $0.9 million   related to the Western World segment and   $0.3 million   related to the AlphaCat segment.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of gross and net reserves for losses and loss expenses by segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , favorable loss reserve development on prior accident years was   $169.4 million  , of which   $89.6 million   related to the Validus Re segment,   $69.7 million   related to the Talbot segment,   $8.5 million   related to the Western World segment and   $1.6 million   related to the AlphaCat segment.  
  The management of insurance and reinsurance companies use significant judgment in the estimation of reserves for losses and loss expenses. Given the magnitude of some notable loss events and other uncertainties inherent in loss estimation, meaningful uncertainty remains regarding the estimation for these events. The Company's actual ultimate net loss may vary materially from these estimates. Ultimate losses for notable loss events are estimated through detailed review of contracts which are identified by the Company as potentially exposed to the specific notable loss event. However, there can be no assurance that the ultimate loss amount estimated for a specific contract will be accurate, or that all contracts with exposure to a specific notable loss event will be identified in a timely manner. Potential losses in excess of the estimated ultimate loss assigned to a contract on the basis of a specific review, or loss amounts from contracts not specifically included in the detailed review may be reserved for in the reserve for potential development on notable loss events ("RDE") and would be included as part of the Company's overall reserves. As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no RDE. 
  For disclosure purposes, only those notable loss events which have an ultimate loss estimate above $30.0 million are disclosed separately and included in the reserves for notable loss event roll forward table below. To the extent that there are increased complexity and volatility factors relating to notable loss events in the aggregate, RDE may be established for a specific accident year.

The reserves for notable loss events table below does not disclose notable loss events prior to 2014. The following pre-2014 notable loss events had closing reserves associated with them as at   September 30, 2016   as follows: Deepwater Horizon, a 2010 event, had   $10.1 million  ; the New Zealand earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 had   $68.7 million  ; Superstorm Sandy, a 2012 event had   $59.1 million  ; and Costa Concordia, also a 2012 event had   $25.4 million  .

    Includes paid losses, case reserves and IBNR reserves. 
              (b) 
    Development other than allocation of RDE.

    Closing Reserve for the period equals Closing Estimate for the period less cumulative paid losses (recovery). 
              (e) 
    As at September 30, 2014, the initial estimate for Tripoli Airport was below the $30.0 million notable loss event threshold; however, during the fourth quarter of 2014 adverse development caused this event to exceed the notable loss event threshold.

Sources of Liquidity  
  Holding Company Liquidity 
  Validus Holdings is a holding company and conducts no operations of its own. The Company relies primarily on cash dividends and other permitted payments from operating subsidiaries within the Validus Re, Talbot, Western World and AlphaCat segments to pay dividends, finance expenses and other holding company expenses. There are restrictions on the payment of dividends from most operating subsidiaries, primarily due to regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which the operating subsidiaries are domiciled. The Company believes the dividend/distribution capacity of the Company s subsidiaries will provide the Company with sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing capital structure to meet its short and long-term objectives. 
  The following table details the capital resources of certain subsidiaries of the Company on an unconsolidated basis: 

(a) 
    Validus Reinsurance, Ltd. (excluding capital supporting FAL) includes capital of   $665,111   relating to Western World Insurance Group, Inc. 
              (b) 
    Validus Reinsurance, Ltd. (excluding capital supporting FAL) excludes capital of   $746,854   which supports Talbot's FAL. This capital was included in Talbot Holdings, Ltd. (including capital supporting FAL). 
              (c) 
    Total shareholders' equity available to Validus common shareholders excludes the liquidation value of the preferred shares of $150,000. 
     Sources and Uses of Cash 
  The Company has written certain (re)insurance business that has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity. This results in volatility in both results and operational cash flows. The potential for large claims or a series of claims under one or more reinsurance contracts means that substantial and unpredictable payments may be required within relatively short periods of time. As a result, cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate, perhaps significantly, between individual quarters and years. Management believes the Company s unused credit facility amounts and highly liquid investment portfolio are sufficient to support any potential operating cash flow deficiencies.  
  In addition to relying on premiums received and investment income from the investment portfolio, the Company intends to meet these cash flow demands by carrying a substantial amount of short and medium term investments that would mature, or possibly be sold, prior to the settlement of expected liabilities. The Company cannot provide assurance, however, that it will successfully match the structure of its investments with its liabilities due to uncertainty related to the timing and severity of loss events. 
  
   127 

     Table of Contents  

There are three main sources of cash flows for the Company: operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. The movement in net cash provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities and the effect of foreign currency rate changes on cash and cash equivalents for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is provided in the following table: 

Operating Activities 
  Cash flow from operating activities is derived primarily from the receipt of premiums less the payment of losses and loss expenses related to underwriting activities. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $254.6 million   compared to   $146.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   a favorable   movement of   $107.7 million  . This   favorable   movement was primarily due to the timing of premium receipts.  
  We anticipate that cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient to cover cash outflows under our contractual commitments as well as most loss scenarios through the foreseeable future. Refer to the    Capital Resources    section below for further information on our anticipated obligations. 
  Investing Activities 
  Cash flow from investing activities is derived primarily from the receipt of net proceeds on the Company s investment portfolio. As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company s portfolio was composed of fixed income, short-term and other investments amounting to   $8.5 billion   or   93.8%   of total cash and investments. For further details related to investments pledged as collateral, refer to Note   3  ,   "Investments,"   to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1.  
  Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $669.3 million   compared to   $179.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , representing an increase in net cash used of   $490.1 million  . This increase was primarily due to increased purchases of short-term investments in the Company's non-managed portfolio on behalf of AlphaCat investors. 
  Financing Activities 
  Cash flow from financing activities is derived primarily from the issuance and purchase of shares in the Company and its subsidiaries, including third party investments in the AlphaCat ILS funds and sidecars, as well as the issuance of notes payable to AlphaCat investors. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $149.8 million   compared to net cash used in financing activities of   $91.7 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   a favorable   movement of   $241.5 million  . This   favorable   movement was driven primarily by   an increase   in the issuance of notes payable to AlphaCat investors of   $220.9 million  ,   an increase   of   $144.9 million   resulting from the issuance of preferred shares,   an increase   in third party investments in noncontrolling interests of   $162.1 million  ; partially offset by   a decrease   in third party investments in redeemable noncontrolling interest of   $115.8 million   and an increase in third party subscriptions deployed on AlphaCat funds and sidecars of   $250.8 million  .

    reserve for losses and loss expenses; 
                
    premium estimates for business written on a line slip or proportional basis; 
                
    the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets;

  The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as defined and in pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that all material information relating to the Company required to be filed in this report has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported when required and the information is accumulated and communicated, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the Company s evaluation required pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  During the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to litigation and arbitration. Legal proceedings such as claims litigation are common in the insurance and reinsurance industry in general. The Company and its subsidiaries may be subject to lawsuits and regulatory actions in the normal course of business that do not arise from or directly relate to claims on reinsurance treaties or contracts or insurance policies. 
  Litigation typically can include, but is not limited to, allegations of underwriting errors or misconduct, employment claims, regulatory activity, shareholder disputes or disputes arising from business ventures. These events are difficult, if not impossible, to predict with certainty. It is Company policy to dispute all allegations against the Company and/or its subsidiaries that management believes are without merit. 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company was not a party to, or involved in any litigation or arbitration that it believes could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  The Company's results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties described in  Risk Factors  included in Item 1A in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The risk factors identified therein have not materially changed.

ITEM 2.     UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  The Company, from time to time, repurchases its shares in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions, under its share repurchase program. The timing, form and amount of the share repurchases under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, the Company s capital position relative to internal and rating agency targets, legal requirements and other factors. Share repurchases may also include repurchases by the Company of shares from employees in order to facilitate the payment of withholding taxes on restricted shares that have vested. The Company repurchases these shares at their fair market value, as determined by reference to the closing price of its common shares on the day the restricted shares vested. The Company's share repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by its Board of Directors at any time. 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the number of shares repurchased by the Company was   1,349,690   which resulted in a dilutive impact on book value per diluted common share of $  0.07   for the quarter. 
  The Company has, from the inception of its share repurchase program to   November 1, 2016  , repurchased   80,272,622   common shares for an aggregate purchase price of   $2.7 billion  . As of   November 1, 2016  , the Company had   $332.6 million   remaining under its authorized share repurchase program. 

(a) 
    Share transactions are on a trade date basis through   November 1, 2016   and are inclusive of commissions. Average share price is rounded to two decimal places. 
              (b) 
    The maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the program is calculated using the average execution price at month end.

  Not applicable. 
   
  ITEM 5.     OTHER INFORMATION 
  Disclosure of Certain Activities Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
  Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports whether it or an affiliate knowingly engaged in certain activities described in that section, including certain activities related to Iran during the period covered by the report.  
  Effective January 16, 2016, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury adopted General License H which authorizes non-U.S. entities that are owned or controlled by a U.S. person to engage in certain activities with Iran so long as they comply with certain specific requirements set forth therein. 
  Certain of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries provide global marine hull policies that provide coverage for vessels navigating into and out of ports worldwide. In light of EU and U.S. modifications to Iran sanctions this year, including the issuance of General License H, and consistent with General License H, the Company has been notified that certain of its policyholders have begun to ship cargo to and from Iran, including transporting crude oil from Iran to another country and transporting refined petroleum products to Iran. Since these policies insure multiple voyages and fleets containing multiple ships, the Company is unable to attribute gross revenues and net profits from such marine policies to these activities involving Iran. The Company intends for its non-U.S. subsidiaries to continue to provide such coverage to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
  Certain of the Company's other non-U.S. subsidiaries have policies that provide excess of loss reinsurance coverage for various risks worldwide. In light of EU and U.S. modifications to Iran sanctions this year, including the issuance of General License H, and consistent with General License H, the Company has been notified that one of its cedants provides hull and marine, war and related coverage to a drilling contractor that operates drilling rigs located in offshore Iranian oilfields. As the reinsurance coverage provided to this cedant covers multiple global risks and multiple insureds, the Company is unable to attribute gross revenues and net profits from such policy to these activities involving Iran. The Company intends for its non-U.S. subsidiaries to continue to provide such coverage to the extent permitted by applicable law.
