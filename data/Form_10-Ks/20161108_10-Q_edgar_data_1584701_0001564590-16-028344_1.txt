TOPS HOLDING II CORPORATION 
      NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
 1. THE COMPANY, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The Company 
 Tops Holding II Corporation ( Holding II,  or collectively with its subsidiaries, the  Company ), the parent of Tops Holding LLC ( Holding I ), formerly Tops Holding Corporation, was incorporated on May 7, 2013.  Holding I is the parent of Tops Markets, LLC ( Tops Markets ), a supermarket retailer with supermarkets in New York, Northern Pennsylvania, Western Vermont and North Central Massachusetts.  As of October 8, 2016, the Company operated 172 supermarkets; 171 under the Tops banner and one under the Orchard Fresh banner, with an additional five supermarkets operated by franchisees under the Tops banner.  Holding II has no business operations other than the ownership of Holding I and as the issuer of the 2018 Notes (see Note 6) and a guarantor of the 2022 Notes (see Note 6). 
 Holding II is the reporting entity for the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes.  Tops MBO Corporation ( Tops MBO Co ), the parent company of Holding II, is neither a co-issuer nor guarantor of these notes.  Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared for Holding II and exclude the assets and results of operations of Tops MBO Co.  Tops MBO Co s assets consist solely of its investment in Holding II.  Tops MBO Co has no operations other than as the equity owner of Holding II. 
 Accounting Policies 
 A summary of the Company s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of Holding II for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, which appear in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2016. 
 Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
 The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 30.  Fiscal years include 13 four-week reporting periods, with an additional week in the thirteenth reporting period for 53-week fiscal years.  The first quarter of each fiscal year includes four reporting periods, while the remaining quarters include three reporting periods. 
 The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the 12-week and 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015 are unaudited, and in the opinion of management, contain all adjustments that are of a normal and recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of financial position and results of operations for such periods. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   Not Yet Adopted 
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU No. 2014-09 ), which provides guidance regarding revenue recognition.  ASU No. 2014-09 s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date,  which deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with earlier application permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU No. 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases,  ( ASU No. 2016-02 ), which stipulates that lessees recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for substantially all leases.  ASU No. 2016-02 is effective on a modified retrospective basis for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
 - 4 - 
 
    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,    Principal versus Agent Considerations  (Reporting Rev  enue Gross versus Net)   ( ASU No. 2016-08 ).  ASU No. 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU No. 2014-09, instead, the amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementati  on guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis.  ASU No. 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue standard issued in ASU No. 2014-09.  The C  ompany is currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption of ASU No. 2016-08 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 Segments 
 The Company s supermarkets offer grocery, produce, frozen, dairy, meat, floral, seafood, health and beauty care, general merchandise, deli and bakery goods.  The Company operates one supermarket format where each supermarket offers the same general mix of products with similar pricing to similar categories of customers.  As of October 8, 2016, 56 corporate supermarkets offered pharmacy services and 52 corporate fuel centers were in operation.  The Company s retail operations, which represent substantially all of the Company s consolidated sales, earnings and total assets, are its only operating segment and reportable segment.  The Company s retail operations as a whole reflect the level at which the business is managed and how the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company s President, who act as the Company s chief operating decision makers, assess performance internally.     
 The following table presents sales revenue by type of similar product (dollars in thousands): 

(1)   
 
 Non-perishables consist of grocery, dairy, frozen, general merchandise, health and beauty care and other non-perishable related products.    

(2)   
 
 Perishables consist of produce, meat, seafood, bakery, deli, floral, prepared foods and other perishable related products.    

(3)   
 
 Other primarily consists of franchise income and service commission income, such as lottery, money orders and money transfers.    

 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  The most significant estimates used by management are related to the accounting for vendor allowances, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets, lease classification, self-insurance reserves, inventory valuation and income taxes.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.

    Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 The provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  establish a framework for measuring fair value and a hierarchy that categorizes and prioritizes the sources to be used to estimate fair value as follows: 
 Level 1   observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
 Level 2   inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs); and 
 Level 3   unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s determination of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  These inputs are developed based on the best information available, including the Company s own data. 
 Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt.  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  At October 8, 2016 and January 2, 2016, the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the Company s debt instruments were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

The fair values of the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes (see Note 6), which are included in long-term debt as of October 8, 2016 and January 2, 2016, were based on quoted market prices, a Level 2 source. 
 Fair value measurements of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities are primarily used in the impairment analysis of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets.  Long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs.  Goodwill and the Tops tradename are reviewed annually for impairment on December 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. 

2. BUSINESS ACQUISITION 
 In August 2016, the Company  acquired four supermarkets from The Stop   Shop Supermarket Company LLC, which operated these stores under the Stop   Shop banner, and two supermarkets from Hannaford Bros. Co., LLC and Martin s Foods of South Burlington, LLC, which operated these stores under the Hannaford banner, in eastern New York and Massachusetts.  The aggregate purchase price for this acquisition of $16.4 million, including acquired inventory of $5.0 million, was funded using cash on hand and available borrowings under the 2017 ABL Facility.    
 The Company believes the acquisition creates significant strategic value due to the expansion it provides to the Company s supermarket base as well as the minimal incremental general and administrative expenses expected to be incurred.  
 Based upon a preliminary allocation of the aggregate purchase price, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates.  The preliminary allocation of the aggregate purchase price is based on management s best estimates of fair values as of the acquisition dates using information available as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is subject to adjustments.  The valuations are expected to be finalized within 12 months of the closing of the acquisitions.  As the valuations are finalized, any changes to the preliminary valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may result in material adjustments to the fair value of inventory, equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities assumed and will be adjusted in the quarter identified, as required by ASU No. 2015-16  Business Combinations (Topic 805).   
   
 - 6 - 
 
    The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets a  cquired and liabilities assumed as of the transaction dates, and adjustments made to the estimated fair values of these assets (dollars in thousands):    

The following table summarizes the Company s unaudited pro forma operating results for the 12-week and 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, giving effect to the acquisition as if it occurred as of the beginning of fiscal year 2015 (dollars in thousands):  

The pro forma financial information above reflects the $2.1 million of transaction costs incurred by the Company during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016 within the operating results for the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015.  Additionally, the pro forma financial information includes estimated depreciation and amortization of $0.3 million during each of the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, and estimated depreciation and amortization of $0.9 million during each of the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015.  This pro forma financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisition had taken place as of the beginning of the periods presented and should not be taken as representative of the Company s future consolidated results of operations. 
 In addition to the acquisition discussed above, during the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016, the Company purchased one additional store for $2.0 million of which $0.5 million was paid during the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016, with the remainder to be paid over the next three years. 
   
 3. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET 
 The following table summarizes the change in the Company s goodwill balance during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016 (dollars in thousands): 

Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment on December 1, or more frequently upon the occurrence of trigger events.  Based on the Company s assessment, no goodwill impairment was recorded during the 12-week and 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015. 
 - 7 - 
 
    Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, consist of the following (dollars in thousands):  

The Tops tradename is reviewed annually for impairment on December 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.  Based on the Company s assessment, no impairment was recorded during the 12-week and 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015. 
 During the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, amortization expense related to intangible assets was $2.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively.  During the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, amortization expense related to intangible assets was $7.2 million and $8.8 million, respectively.  This amortization is included in depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 
 Depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss during each of the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015 includes $0.1 million of contra-expense related to the amortization of unfavorable lease rights, which are classified in other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  During each of the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss includes $0.3 million of contra-expense related to the amortization of unfavorable lease rights.  Expected future amortization of these unfavorable lease rights is contra-expense of $0.2 million in the remaining period of Fiscal 2016, $0.8 million in Fiscal 2017, $0.8 million in Fiscal 2018, $0.8 million in Fiscal 2019, $0.8 million in Fiscal 2020 and $2.1 million thereafter. 
 As of October 8, 2016, expected future amortization of intangible assets is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

- 8 - 
 
    4. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES  
 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following (dollars in thousands): 

5. CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS 
 The Company has a number of capital leases in effect for supermarket properties and equipment.  The initial lease terms generally range up to twenty-five years and will expire at various times through 2036, with options to renew for additional periods.  The majority of the supermarket leases provide for base rental, plus real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance and other operating expenses applicable to the leased premises.  Some leases contain escalation clauses for future rents and contingent rents based on sales volume. 
 As of October 8, 2016, future minimum lease rental payments applicable to non-cancelable capital lease obligations were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

The Company entered into build-to-suit and sale-leaseback transactions in various years involving certain properties that did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting as the lease agreements included various forms of continuing involvement.  As a result, the transactions have been classified as financing transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 840,  Leases.  
   
 - 9 - 
 
    Under the financing method, the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet and proceeds received by the Company from these transactions are recorded as capital lease obligations, allocated between land, as applicable, and building.  Payments under   these leases are applied as payments of imputed interest and deemed principal on the underlying building obligations, with no underlying cash payments deemed attributable to the land obligations and the estimated net book value of the buildings at the con  clusion of the lease terms.  The related land assets are not depreciated, and at the end of the lease terms, the remaining capital lease obligations will equal the combined net book values of the land and buildings.  At the expiration of the lease terms, w  hich range from 2017 to 2036, or when the Company s continuing involvement under the lease agreements ends, the related land, buildings and capital lease obligations will be removed from the consolidated balance sheet, with no underlying cash payments.  Th  ese capital lease obligations are reflected as non-cash obligations in the preceding table.  
   
 6. DEBT 
 Long-term debt is comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): 

On June 10, 2015, Holding I and Tops Markets II Corporation (collectively, the  Issuers ) issued $560.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due in 2022, bearing annual interest at a rate of 8.00% (the  2022 Notes ).  The proceeds from the 2022 Notes were used to fund a tender offer for, and redeem the balance of, the previously outstanding $460.0 million of senior secured notes issued by Holding I, Tops Markets and Tops Markets II Corporation (the  2017 Notes ) and to fund a partial tender offer for $60.0 million of the $150.0 million outstanding 8.75%/9.50% senior unsecured notes issued by Holding II (the  2018 Notes ), including tender and redemption premiums of $23.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which have been recorded within loss on debt extinguishment in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss during the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015.  The proceeds were also used to pay accrued and unpaid interest related to the tendered and redeemed notes and fees and expenses related to the issuance of the 2022 Notes.  The 2022 Notes mature on June 15, 2022 and require semi-annual interest payments on June 15 and December 15.  The 2022 Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June 15, 2018 at specified redemption prices.  Prior to June 15, 2018, the Company may redeem the 2022 Notes, in whole or in part, at a specified  make-whole  premium. 
 The 2022 Notes are collateralized by (i) first priority security interests, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, in the stock held by the Issuers and the guarantor subsidiaries, Tops Markets, Tops PT, LLC, Tops Gift Card Company, LLC and Erie Logistics LLC (collectively, the  Guarantors ), the Company s warehouse and distribution facility in Lancaster, New York, the Company s retail facility located in Fayetteville, New York and certain owned real property acquired by the Issuers and the Guarantors following the issue date of the 2022 Notes, equipment, intellectual property, and substantially all other assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors, other than those assets securing the Company s asset-based revolving credit facility (the  2017 ABL Facility ) on a first priority basis (collectively, the  2022 Notes Priority Collateral ), and (ii) second priority security interests, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, in the assets of Holding II, the Issuers and the Guarantors that secure the 2017 ABL Facility on a first priority basis, including present and future receivables, deposit accounts, inventory, prescription lists, and certain rights and proceeds relating thereto (collectively, the  ABL Priority Collateral ). 
 The 2022 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by each of the Guarantors and will in the future be guaranteed by certain of Holding I s future domestic subsidiaries.  The 2022 Notes are also guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Holding II.  
 - 10 - 
 
    On May 15, 2013, Holding II issued $150.0 million of 2018 Notes.  As discussed above, on June 10, 2015, Holding II successfully tendered for and repurchased $60.0 million of 2018 Notes.  On Ja  nuary 20, 2016 and December 18, 2015, $1.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of 2018 Notes were repurchased in  open market  transactions, resulting in a remaining outstanding principal amount of $85.5 million as of October 8, 2016.  If certain condi  tions are met, Holding II may be entitled to pay interest on the 2018 Notes by increasing the principal of the notes or by issuing new notes as pay-in-kind interest.  This payment in kind interest would accrue at an annual rate of 9.50%.  The 2018 Notes ma  ture   on   June 15, 2018 and require semi-annual interest payments on June 15 and December 15.  To the extent permitted by the indenture governing the 2022 Notes and the 2017 ABL Facility (see below), Holding I may make dividend payments to Holding II to fund   additional repurchases and the semi-annual interest payments for the 2018 Notes.  The 2018 Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at specified redemption prices.    
 On December 14, 2012, Tops Markets entered into the 2017 ABL Facility with Bank of America, N.A. as collateral agent and administrative agent.  The 2017 ABL Facility allows a maximum borrowing capacity of $125.0 million, subject to a borrowing base calculation, with an option for up to $50.0 million of additional borrowing capacity if the required conditions are met.  The borrowing base includes inventory, pharmacy prescription files and certain receivables.  The 2017 ABL Facility matures on December 14, 2017. 
 Costs associated with the 2022 Notes and 2018 Notes of $10.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively, were capitalized and are being amortized over the respective terms of the 2022 Notes and 2018 Notes using the effective interest method.  Costs associated with the 2017 ABL Facility of $1.1 million were capitalized and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the 2017 ABL Facility.   
 During each of the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, amortization expense related to the deferred financing costs was $0.5 million.  During the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, amortization expense related to the deferred financing costs was $1.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively.  This amortization expense is included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.  At October 8, 2016, long-term debt included deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization of $3.5 million, totaling $10.9 million.  At January 2, 2016, long-term debt included deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization of $1.8 million, totaling $12.7 million.  
 As of October 8, 2016, the unused availability under the 2017 ABL Facility was $32.7 million, after giving effect to the borrowing base calculation, $22.8 million of letters of credit outstanding and $69.5 million of borrowings outstanding.  As of January 2, 2016, $23.8 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the 2017 ABL Facility.  Revolving loans under the 2017 ABL Facility, at the Company s option, bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of 150 to 200 basis points, determined based on levels of borrowing availability, or the prime rate plus a margin of 50 to 100 basis points, determined based on levels of borrowing availability.  As of October 8, 2016 and January 2, 2016, the weighted average interest rates on borrowings under the 2017 ABL Facility were 2.62% and 3.20%, respectively.  The 2017 ABL Facility is collateralized primarily by (i) first priority interests, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, in the ABL Priority Collateral, and (ii) second priority interests, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, in the 2022 Notes Priority Collateral. 
 The instruments governing the 2022 Notes, 2018 Notes and the 2017 ABL Facility impose customary affirmative and negative covenants on the Company, including restrictions on indebtedness, liens, type of business, acquisitions, investments, sale or transfer of assets, payment of dividends, transactions involving affiliates, and obligations on a change in control.  Failure to meet any of these covenants would be an event of default.  On August 19, 2014, the 2017 ABL Facility was amended to reduce specified restrictions on the Company s ability to make certain restricted payments, including dividends.  As of October 8, 2016, the Company was in compliance with its covenants under these agreements. 

7. INCOME TAXES 
 Income tax expense was as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Based on an assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the Company s deferred tax assets, the Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against total net deferred tax assets, and consequently, the Company recognized no income tax benefit during the 12-week and 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015. 
   
 - 11 - 
 
    The income tax expense recognized for the   12-week and 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015 solely reflects the recognition of additional valuation allowance associated with the tax amortization of the Company s indefinite-lived tradename and goodwill deferred tax liabilities.    The effective tax rates would have been 39.1%, without the establishment of valuation allowance, during each of the 12-week and 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016.  The effective tax rates during the 12-week and 40-week periods ended October 3, 2015 wo  uld have been   39.3% and 39.1%, respectively, without the establishment of valuation allowance.  
 As of the beginning of fiscal year 2016, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $70.9 million and $71.5 million, respectively, which expire beginning in 2029.  In addition, the Company had federal tax credits of $5.4 million, which expire beginning in 2027. 

8. GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS 
 During January 2015, the Company sold pharmacy scripts and inventory related to 27 of its in-store pharmacy locations for cash proceeds of $14.9 million.  These pharmacies were then closed.  A resulting gain on sale of assets of $11.0 million, net of the carrying value of sold inventory of $3.2 million and direct selling expenses of $0.7 million, was recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015. 

9. DIVIDENDS PAID 
 On January 14, 2016, the Company paid a dividend to Tops MBO Co totaling $2.0 million. 
 On January 8, 2015, the Company paid a dividend of $0.8 million to Tops MBO Co to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock of Tops MBO Co from a former Company executive.  In addition, one outstanding share of common stock of Holding II was repurchased. 

10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 Multiemployer Pension Plans 
 On December 22, 2013, Tops Markets acquired all of the membership interests of Erie Logistics, LLC ( Erie Logistics ) and certain other assets from C S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. ( C S ).  Erie Logistics operates the Company s warehouse and distribution facilities located in Lancaster and West Seneca, New York and employs the warehouse and driver personnel at these facilities, all of whom are represented by Teamsters Local 264.  Under its supply agreement with Tops Markets, C S, through Erie Logistics, had operated the Company s warehouse and distribution facilities since 2002. 
 In late January 2014, the Company received notice that the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund (the  Fund ) had suspended Erie Logistics as a participating employer in the Fund pending the Fund s investigation into the acquisition of Erie Logistics from C S.  This suspension was retroactive to the effective date of the acquisition.  During this  suspension  and thereafter through the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Erie Logistics has elected to continue to make contributions to the Fund in accordance with the terms set forth in the collective bargaining agreements with Teamsters Local 264.  The Fund has rejected and returned these contributions.  During the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, these rejected contributions totaled $0.8 million and $1.2 million respectively.  During the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, these rejected contributions totaled $3.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively.  On May 27, 2014, the Fund provided Erie Logistics and C S with notice of its determination that Erie Logistics incurred employer withdrawal liability as a result of the acquisition.  The notice provides that Erie Logistics owes withdrawal liability of $183.7 million, payable in a lump sum or in monthly installments, calculated to give effect to a limit on total withdrawal liability imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ), of $641,514 for 240 months. 
 The Company believes that the Fund s determination of a withdrawal violates ERISA, the existing participation agreements between Erie Logistics and the Fund, and the fiduciary duties of the trustees of the Fund.  The Company is vigorously contesting this determination through mandatory arbitration under ERISA. 
   
 - 12 - 
 
    The Company has not recorded any reserve for this matter as a loss is not considered probable.  If it were ultimately determined that   Erie Logistics has incurred a withdrawal liability to the Fund, the Company would bear financial responsibility for this liability.  Under the terms of the purchase agreement for the acquisition of Erie Logistics from C S, and as a continuation of its pri  or contractual obligations, the Company retains the obligation to indemnify C S in the event withdrawal liability is imposed on Erie Logistics, the Company or C S.  During the pendency of the proceeding to contest the withdrawal determination, ERISA requir  es that conditional monthly payments of withdrawal liability be made, which began July 28, 2014.  During each of the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, the conditional payments of withdrawal liability totaled $5.8 million.  These mo  nthly conditional payments are in addition to pension contributions the Company has elected to make for the benefit of Erie Logistics  associates under the collective bargaining agreements with Teamsters Local 264 which, as noted, the Fund has refused to a  ccept.  The aggregate conditional monthly payments of withdrawal liability, totaling $17.3 million as of October 8, 2016, have been recorded in other assets, while the aggregate rejected contributions that the Company has elected to make, totaling $12.7 mi  llion as of October 8, 2016, have been recorded in other long-term liabilities and cash within its condensed consolidated balance sheet.  
 On July 28, 2014, Teamsters Local 264 filed a grievance charging a violation of its collective bargaining agreements by reason of the Company s failing to participate in the Fund.  On July 4, 2016, the arbitrator denied this grievance.  The Company is in active discussions with Teamsters Local 264 regarding certain aspects of the grievance and the arbitrator s decision.   
 Purchase Commitments 
 Effective December 22, 2013, in connection with its purchase of all the membership interests of Erie Logistics and certain other assets from C S, the Company modified its existing agreement with C S whereby the Company resumed warehousing and transportation functions for the Lancaster and West Seneca, New York warehouses, while C S continues to provide procurement and purchasing services in support of the majority of the Company s supply chain.  This modified agreement sets out the parties' respective responsibilities for the procurement and purchase of merchandise intended for use or resale in a majority of the Company s supermarkets.  In consideration for the services it provides under this agreement, C S is paid a fee based on all merchandise purchased by the Company from C S through the Lancaster and West Seneca, New York warehouses, with C S also having incentive income opportunities under the agreement.  As of April 1, 2015, the Company and C S agreed in principle to amend certain operating terms of this agreement and extend the term through April 1, 2020. 
 On September 24, 2012, the Company entered into a separate agreement with C S to provide warehousing, transportation, procurement and purchasing services in support of the 21 supermarkets acquired from GU Markets in October 2012.  This agreement expires on September 23, 2022. 
 Effective May 1, 2013, Tops Markets entered into a member participation agreement with Topco, a procurement cooperative for food retailers and wholesalers, for the supply of substantially all of the Company s prescription drugs.  Tops Markets must purchase 95% of its branded prescription drugs and 95% of its generic pharmaceutical products through Topco.  This agreement expires February 28, 2017. 
 Effective March 1, 2016, the Company extended its existing IT outsourcing agreement with HP Enterprise Services, LLC ( HPE ) through February 29, 2024.  Under this agreement, HPE provides data center operations, mainframe processing, business applications and systems development, which are expected to enhance the Company s customer service and efficiency.  The amounts payable to HP under this agreement are based upon the services requested by the Company at predetermined rates. 
 The costs of these purchase commitments are not reflected in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 
 Environmental Liabilities 
 The Company is contingently liable for potential environmental issues related to some of its properties.  As the Company is unaware of environmental issues that are expected to materially impact the Company s consolidated financial statements as a whole, no amounts were accrued as of October 8, 2016 or January 2, 2016. 
 Collective Bargaining Agreements 
 The Company employs approximately 15,000 associates.  Approximately 81% of these associates are members of United Food and Commercial Workers, or UFCW, District Union Local One, or Local One, or six other UFCW unions.  Approximately 4% of these associates are members of Teamsters Local 264, who work in the Company s warehouse and distribution facilities.  All other associates are non-union.  The Company is a party to five collective bargaining agreements with Local One expiring between April 2017 and October 2018.  The Company also is a party to seven other non-Local One UFCW collective bargaining agreements expiring between April 2017 and October 2019.  The Company is a party to three collective bargaining agreements with Teamsters Local 264 that expire in August 2019.

    Legal Proceedings  
 Except as otherwise disclosed in this note, the Company is unaware of any legal proceedings that are expected to materially impact the Company s consolidated financial statements as a whole.  No amounts related to contingent liabilities due to legal proceedings were accrued as of October 8, 2016 or January 2, 2016. 
   
 11. IMPAIRMENT 
 During the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016, the Company determined that the expected future cash flows associated with one supermarket location were insufficient to recover that location s aggregate net book value of long-lived assets.  As a result, the net book values of leasehold improvements and equipment assets were written down to their estimated fair values, a Level 3 fair value source.  A corresponding non-cash impairment of $2.1 million was recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016. 
     ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  10-Q ).

 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 We operate on a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 30.  Our fiscal years include 13 four-week reporting periods, with an additional week in the thirteenth reporting period for 53-week fiscal years.  Our first quarter of each fiscal year includes four reporting periods, while the remaining quarters include three reporting periods. 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements for the 12-week and 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015 are unaudited, and, in the opinion of our management, contain all adjustments that are of a normal and recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of financial position and results of operations for such periods. 
 RECENT EVENTS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE COMPARABILITY OF REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 June 2015 Refinancing 
 On June 10, 2015, Holding I and Tops Markets II Corporation issued $560.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes, bearing annual interest at a rate of 8.00%.  The proceeds from the 2022 Notes were used to fund a tender offer for, and redeem the balance of, the previously outstanding $460.0 million of 2017 Notes and to fund a partial tender offer for $60.0 million of the $150.0 million outstanding 2018 Notes, including tender and redemption premiums of $23.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively.  The proceeds were also used to pay accrued and unpaid interest related to the tendered and redeemed notes and fees and expenses related to the issuance of the 2022 Notes. 
 2015 Sale of Pharmacy Assets 
 During January 2015, we sold pharmacy scripts and inventory related to 27 of our in-store pharmacy locations, which resulted in a gain on sale of assets of $11.0 million in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015.

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 12-Week Period Ended October 8, 2016 Compared with the 12-Week Period Ended October 3, 2015 
 Summary 
 The results of operations during the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016 were impacted by the $28.6 million incremental inside sales contribution from 12 acquired and new supermarkets opened since September 2015 and a same store sales decrease of 2.9%, resulting from food cost deflation and lower traffic and weakness in consumer spending levels.  Relatively lower margin fuel sales decreased $7.3 million during the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016, primarily as a result of a decrease in fuel retail prices.  Our gross profit margin rate remained relatively flat as the impact of a decrease in lower margin fuel sales was offset by an increase in distribution costs, which occurred largely due to $1.2 million in costs associated with our August 2016 relocation to a new freezer warehouse facility during the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016.  Our operating expenses were impacted by $2.3 million of incremental legal and professional fees during the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016 related to the ongoing dispute and associated arbitration proceeding with the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund.    
 Net Sales 
 The following table includes the components of our net sales for the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015. 
 (Dollars in thousands) 

Inside sales increased due to the $28.6 million incremental contribution from 12 acquired and new supermarkets opened since September 2015.  Same store sales decreased 2.9%, primarily due to food cost deflation in certain categories, including meat and dairy, and competitive pressure to lower food prices in response, as well as lower traffic and weakness in consumer spending levels.  Same store sales is inside sales, excluding franchise revenue, for  same stores,  which are supermarkets that have been operating for at least 13 full four-week periods.   To calculate the same store sales change, we used the 12-week period ended October 10, 2015, as this represents the most comparable period to the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016.  
   
 The decrease in fuel sales was due to a 14.6% decrease in the average retail price per gallon, net of applicable discounts, and a 5.1% net decrease in gallons sold that was primarily attributable to the timing of promotional gas rewards redemption weeks. 
   
 Gross Profit 
 The following table includes a comparison of cost of goods sold, distribution costs and gross profit for the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015. 
 (Dollars in thousands) 

As a percentage of net sales, the decrease in cost of goods sold was due to a shift in product mix given the smaller proportion of relatively lower margin fuel sales.  Non-cash LIFO inventory valuation adjustments changed from expense of $0.2 million during the 12-week period ended October 3, 2015 to income of $0.1 million during the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016.  Excluding the impact of LIFO adjustments, cost of goods sold as a percentage of inside sales was 67.5% and 67.4%, respectively, during the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015. 
 The increase in distribution costs as a percentage of net sales was largely due to $1.2 million  of costs associated with our August 2016 relocation to a new freezer warehouse facility.

    Operating Expenses  
 The following table includes a comparison of operating expenses for the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015. 
 (Dollars in thousands) 

Wages, Salaries and Benefits 
 The increase in wages, salaries and benefits as a percentage of net sales was due to the smaller proportion of fuel sales as a percentage of net sales, which require relatively modest labor investments.  As a percentage of inside sales, wages, salaries and benefits was 15.8% and 15.4%, respectively, during the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015.  The increase was due to increases in minimum wages and pension contributions, as well as labor costs of $0.6 million related to the integration of the six acquired stores in Eastern New York and North Central Massachusetts during the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016. 
 Selling and General Expenses 
 Selling and general expenses remained relatively consistent as a percentage of net sales.  
 Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in administrative expenses was largely due to $2.3 million of incremental legal and professional fees during the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016 related to the ongoing dispute and associated arbitration proceeding with the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund discussed in Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1 of this 10-Q.  Additionally, we incurred  $1.7 million of costs in connection with an unsuccessful potential acquisition and  $0.8 million of costs  related to the integration of the six acquired stores in Eastern New York and North Central Massachusetts during the 12-week period ended October 8, 2016.   These increases in administrative expenses were offset by a $1.2 million decrease in bonus expense based upon performance against budget metrics. 
 Rent Expense, Net 
 Rent expense reflects our rental expense for our supermarkets under operating leases, net of income we receive from various entities that rent space in our supermarkets under subleases.  The increase in rent expense was due to new supermarket openings since September 2015. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to incremental depreciation related to capital expenditures since mid-2015.  
 Advertising 
 Advertising remained relatively consistent as a percentage of net sales. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense decreased due to a lower average borrowing rate on long-term debt as a result of our June 2015 refinancing activities.   
   
 - 17 - 
 
    Income Tax Expense  
 Based on an assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against total net deferred tax assets, and consequently, we recognized no income tax benefit during the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015.   
 The income tax expense recognized for the 12-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015 solely reflects the recognition of additional valuation allowance associated with the tax amortization of our indefinite-lived tradename and goodwill deferred tax liabilities.  The effective tax rates would have been 39.1% and 39.3%, respectively, without the establishment of valuation allowance. 
 Net Loss 
 Our net loss increased by $7.6 million for the reasons described above. 
 40-Week Period Ended October 8, 2016 Compared with the 40-Week Period Ended October 3, 2015 
 Summary 
 The results of operations during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016 compared with the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015 were impacted by the $57.9 million incremental inside sales contribution from 14 acquired and new supermarkets opened since May 2015, and a same store sales decrease of 1.8% resulting from food cost deflation and lower traffic and weakness in consumer spending levels.  Fuel sales decreased $24.5 million during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016, primarily as a result of a decrease in fuel retail prices.  Our gross profit margin rate improved 50 basis points due to the decrease in lower margin fuel sales combined with incremental savings of $2.6 million associated with the amendment of certain operating terms of our agreement with C S, which became effective April 1, 2015.  Our operating expenses were impacted by $4.5 million of incremental legal and professional fees during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016 related to the ongoing dispute and associated arbitration proceeding with the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund.   
 Net Sales 
 The following table includes the components of our net sales for the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015. 
 (Dollars in thousands) 

Inside sales increased due to the $57.9 million incremental contribution from 14 acquired and new supermarkets opened since May 2015.  This increase was partially offset by a $2.4 million reduction in pharmacy sales attributable to the closure of 27 in-store pharmacies during January 2015.  Same store sales decreased 1.8%, primarily due to food cost deflation in certain categories, including meat and dairy, and competitive pressure to lower food prices in response, as well as lower traffic and weakness in consumer spending levels.  Same store sales is inside sales, excluding franchise revenue, for  same stores,  which are supermarkets that have been operating for at least 13 full four-week periods.   Sales related to the 27 closed in-store pharmacies have been excluded for purposes of calculating same store sales.  To calculate the same store sales change, we used the 40-week period ended October 10, 2015, as this represents the most comparable period to the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016.  
 The decrease in fuel sales was due to a 17.7% decrease in the average retail price per gallon, net of applicable discounts, and a 2.2% net decrease in gallons sold.

    Gross Profit  
 The following table includes a comparison of cost of goods sold, distribution costs and gross profit for the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015. 
 (Dollars in thousands) 

As a percentage of net sales, the decrease in cost of goods sold was due to a shift in product mix given the smaller proportion of relatively lower margin fuel sales.  Non-cash LIFO inventory valuation expense decreased $0.5 million from $0.7 million during the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015 to $0.2 million during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016.  Excluding the impact of LIFO adjustments, cost of goods sold as a percentage of inside sales was 67.3% during each of the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015.   
 The decrease in distribution costs was due to $2.1 million of incremental savings associated with the amendment of certain operating terms of our agreement with C S, which became effective April 1, 2015.  This amount recorded in distribution costs is in addition to $0.5 million of savings classified in cost of goods sold related to the amended terms.  This decrease was partially offset by $1.2 million of  costs associated with our August 2016 relocation to a new freezer warehouse facility.  
 Operating Expenses 
 The following table includes a comparison of operating expenses for the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015. 
 (Dollars in thousands) 

Wages, Salaries and Benefits 
 The increase in wages, salaries and benefits as a percentage of net sales was due to the smaller proportion of fuel sales as a percentage of net sales, which require relatively modest labor investments.  As a percentage of inside sales, wages, salaries and benefits was a consistent 15.6%.  
 Selling and General Expenses 
 Selling and general expenses remained relatively consistent as a percentage of net sales. 
     
 - 19 - 
 
  Administrative Expenses  
 The increase in administrative expenses was largely due to $1.0 million of costs related to the integration of the six acquired stores in Eastern New York and North Central Massachusetts, and $1.7 million of costs in connection with an unsuccessful potential acquisition, during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016.  Additionally, $4.5 million of incremental legal and professional fees were incurred during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016 related to the ongoing dispute and associated arbitration proceeding with the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund discussed in Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1 of this 10-Q.  These increases in administrative expenses were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in bonus expense based upon performance against budget metrics. 
 Rent Expense, Net 
 Rent expense reflects our rental expense for supermarkets under operating leases, net of income we receive from various entities that rent space in our supermarkets under subleases.  The increase in rent expense was due to new supermarket openings since May 2015. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to incremental depreciation related to capital expenditures since early 2015.  
 Advertising 
 Advertising remained relatively consistent as a percentage of net sales. 
 Impairment 
 During the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016, we determined that the expected future cash flows associated with one supermarket location were insufficient to recover the location s aggregate net book value of long-lived assets.  As a result, the net book values of leasehold improvements and equipment assets were written down to their estimated fair values.  A corresponding non-cash impairment of $2.1 million was recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.   
 Gain on Sale of Assets 
 During January 2015, we sold pharmacy scripts and inventory related to 27 of our in-store pharmacy locations for cash proceeds of $14.9 million.  These pharmacies were then closed.  A resulting gain on sale of assets of $11.0 million, net of the carrying value of sold inventory of $3.2 million and direct selling expenses of $0.7 million, was recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015. 
 Loss on debt extinguishment 
 During June 2015, we satisfied and discharged our obligations under our 2017 Notes and redeemed $60.0 million of our 2018 Notes.  In connection with these financing activities, we recorded a $34.5 million loss on debt extinguishment during the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015.  See Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this 10-Q for further details. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense decreased $1.4 million due primarily to a lower average borrowing rate on long-term debt as a result of our June 2015 refinancing activities. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Based on an assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against total net deferred tax assets, and consequently, we recognized no income tax benefit during the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015.   
 The income tax expense recognized for the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015 solely reflects the recognition of additional valuation allowance associated with the tax amortization of our indefinite-lived tradename and goodwill deferred tax liabilities.  The effective tax rates would have been 39.1% during each of the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015 without the establishment of valuation allowance.

    Net Loss  
 Our net loss decreased by $16.1 million for the reasons described above. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our primary sources of cash are cash flows generated from our operations and borrowings under our 2017 ABL Facility.  Our 2017 ABL Facility allows a maximum borrowing capacity of $125.0 million, subject to a borrowing base calculation, with an option for future upsizing with up to $50.0 million of incremental commitments if the required conditions are met.  As of October 8, 2016, the unused availability under our 2017 ABL Facility was $32.7 million, after giving effect to the borrowing base calculation, $22.8 million of letters of credit outstanding and $69.5 million of borrowings outstanding.  We expect that cash generated from operations and availability under our 2017 ABL Facility will permit us to fund our debt service requirements, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.  We do not expect to make dividends of significant size in the near future; however, we may pay dividends to our stockholders from time to time.  Our financial flexibility will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the grocery industry and financial, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.  Although unforeseen, if faced with the need to increase liquidity, we could readily respond through the control of variable operating expenses (for example, by adjusting employment levels) and through the reduction of planned capital expenditure and acquisition activities. 
 On June 10, 2015, Holding I and Tops Markets II Corporation issued $560.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes, bearing annual interest of 8.00%.  The proceeds from the 2022 Notes were used to fund a tender offer for, and redeem the balance of, the previously outstanding $460.0 million of 2017 Notes and to fund a partial tender offer for $60.0 million of the $150.0 million outstanding 2018 Notes, including tender and redemption premiums of $23.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively.  The proceeds were also used to pay accrued and unpaid interest related to the tendered and redeemed 2017 Notes and 2018 Notes and fees and expenses related to the issuance of the 2022 Notes.  See Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements of Item 1 in this 10-Q. 
 During January 2015, we sold pharmacy scripts and inventory related to 27 of our in-store pharmacies for cash proceeds of $14.9 million.  These pharmacies were then closed. 
 On December 15, 2016, semi-annual cash interest payments totaling $26.1 million are payable related to our 2022 Notes and 2018 Notes.  We expect these payments will be primarily funded through cash from operations.  No principal amounts are payable related to these notes until their respective maturities on June 15, 2022 and June 15, 2018.

    Cash Flows Information  
 The following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities: 
 (Dollars in thousands)  

Cash provided by operating activities during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016 decreased $25.3 million compared with the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015 due to a decrease in earnings, adjusted for non-cash income and expense, of $5.4 million primarily related to one-time administrative expenses, including $4.5 million of incremental legal and professional fees paid related to the ongoing dispute and associated arbitration proceeding with the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund.   Changes in operating assets and liabilities represented a use of cash of $5.9 million during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016 compared with a source of cash of $14.0 million during the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015.  A lower increase in accrued expenses was due to an $8.9 million increase in bonus payments during the 2016 period related to 2015 due to better performance against budget metrics in 2015 versus 2014.  Inventory increased slightly during the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015, in part due to the sale of pharmacy inventory related to the closure of 27 of our in-store pharmacies.  Inventory increased approximately $9.0 million during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016 due to the replenishment of lower than normal inventory levels at 2015 year-end, which was caused in part by the 2015 fiscal year ending after the New Year's Day holiday, as well as increases in inventory associated with nine new stores added during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016.  
 Cash used in investing activities increased $22.6 million during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016 compared with the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015 due to $17.4 million paid in connection with seven supermarkets acquired in August 2016, partially offset by a decrease in normal capital expenditure payments.  We expect to invest $40 million to $45 million in capital expenditures, exclusive of acquired inventory, during fiscal year 2016, primarily related to new supermarket locations, remodels and maintenance activities.  These capital expenditures are funded using  cash on hand and available borrowings under the 2017 ABL Facility . 
 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities changed $33.8 million during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016 compared with the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015.  The change reflects a change in net borrowings and repayments on our 2017 ABL Facility of $43.3 million, from net repayments of $20.5 million during the 40-week period ended October 3, 2015 to net borrowings of $22.8 million during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016.  Partially offsetting this impact were cash flows related to the June 2015 refinancing activities, including the proceeds from the 2022 Notes of $560.0 million, the tender offer for, and redemption of the balance of, the previously outstanding 2017 Notes and partial tender offer for the 2018 Notes, and fees and expenses incurred related to the 2022 Notes issuance.  We paid a dividend of $2.0 million to Tops MBO Co and repurchased $1.2 million of our 2018 Notes during the 40-week period ended October 8, 2016. 
 Multiemployer Pension Plans 
 We contribute to the Local One plan, a defined benefit multiemployer pension plan, under our collective bargaining agreements with Local One.  The Local One plan generally provides retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers.  We are contingently liable for withdrawal liability in the event that we withdraw from the Local One plan.  The actuary for the Local One plan has estimated that, as of December 31, 2014, our withdrawal liability would have been $349.2 million in the event of our complete withdrawal from the Local One plan during 2015.  In accordance with applicable accounting rules, our contingent withdrawal liability is not included in our consolidated financial statements.  We have no intention to withdraw from the Local One plan.  During the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, we made contributions of $11.2 million and $9.4 million, respectively, to this plan.  We are required to increase our annual contributions to the Local One plan pursuant to our current collective bargaining agreements and the Local One plan s current rehabilitation plan. 
 As a result of our acquisition of Erie Logistics from C S in December 2013, we believe we assumed the obligation to participate in and contribute to the Fund.  During the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, we made contributions to the Fund of $4.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively. 
   
 - 22 - 
 
    We are contingently liable for withdrawal liability in the event of a withdrawal from th  e Fund, which includes any withdrawal liability imposed on Erie Logistics for which C S is liable.  In late January 2014, we received notice that the Fund had suspended Erie Logistics as a participating employer in the Fund pending the Fund s investigation   into the acquisition and on May 27, 2014, the Fund provided notice ( Notice ) to Erie Logistics and C S of its determination that Erie Logistics incurred employer withdrawal liability as a result of the acquisition.  
 Though no longer contractually required to do so given the suspension and Notice, we have elected to continue to tender contributions to the Fund for the Erie Logistics associates in accordance with the terms set forth in the collective bargaining agreements with Teamsters Local 264.  The Fund has rejected and returned these contributions to date.  As a result, to date, we have chosen to establish a separate interest bearing account to hold these rejected contributions, although we may decide, in our sole discretion, to discontinue this practice in the future. 
 The Notice provides that Erie Logistics owes withdrawal liability of $183.7 million, payable in a lump sum or in monthly installments, calculated to give effect to a limit on total withdrawal liability imposed by ERISA, of $641,514 for 240 months.  If it were ultimately determined that Erie Logistics incurred a withdrawal liability to the Fund, the Company would bear financial responsibility for this liability.  Under the terms of the purchase agreement for the acquisition of Erie Logistics from C S, and as a continuation of our prior contractual obligations, the Company retains the obligation to indemnify C S in the event withdrawal liability is imposed on Erie Logistics, the Company or C S.  Although we are vigorously contesting the withdrawal determination, during the pendency of the proceeding to contest such determination, ERISA requires that conditional monthly payments of withdrawal liability be made, which began July 28, 2014.  During each of the 40-week periods ended October 8, 2016 and October 3, 2015, the monthly conditional payments of withdrawal liability totaled $5.8 million.  These monthly conditional payments are in addition to pension contributions the Company has tendered which the Fund has rejected and returned, as discussed above and in Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this 10-Q. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Our off-balance sheet arrangements at October 8, 2016 consisted of operating leases and any potential withdrawal liability obligations under our multi-employer pension plans.  We are not a party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, net sales, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 Inflation 
 Product cost inflation could vary from our estimates due to general economic conditions, weather, availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging, and other factors beyond our control. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. 
 Refer to Holding II s audited consolidated financial statements as of January 2, 2016 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain critical accounting policies, including those related to vendor allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of tradename, valuation of long-lived assets, acquisition accounting, leases, self-insurance programs and income taxes.
