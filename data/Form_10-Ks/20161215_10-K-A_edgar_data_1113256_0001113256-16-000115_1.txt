EXPLANATORY NOTE - AMENDMENT 
    
  Meritor, Inc. ( Meritor ) is filing this Amendment No.1 on Form 10-K/A (this "Form 10-K/A") to include in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2016 (the  Annual Report ), pursuant to Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, consolidated financial statements and related notes of Meritor WABCO Vehicle Control Systems ("MWVCS") in which Meritor owns a 50% interest.  
    Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X provides that if a 50% or less-owned person accounted for by the equity method meets the first or third condition of the significant subsidiary tests set forth in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X, substituting 20% for 10%, separate annual financial statements for such 50% or less-owned person corresponding to the periods covered by the financial statements of Meritor included in the Annual Report shall be filed. Such statements are required to be audited only for the years in which such person met such test. If the 50 percent or less owned person is not an accelerated filer, the required financial statements may be filed as an amendment to the report. 
  Meritor has included in this Form 10-K/A the audited consolidated financial statements of MWVCS for the 2016, 2015 and 2014 fiscal years. MWVCS, which is not an accelerated filer, met the significance test for the 2015 fiscal year and Meritor is required to file audited consolidated financial statements of MWVCS as of and for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2015. MWVCS did not meet the significance test for fiscal years 2016 and 2014; therefore, MWVCS consolidated statements are required to be included for that period but are not required to be audited.  However, MWVCS was audited for the 2016 and 2014 fiscal years and as those audited consolidated statements are available, they are included in this Form 10-K/A as audited.  
  Item 15 is the only portion of the Annual Report being supplemented or amended by this Form 10-K/A. Additionally, in connection with the filing of this Form 10-K/A and pursuant to SEC rules, Meritor is including the consent of the independent auditors of MWVCS and currently dated certifications. This Form 10-K/A does not otherwise update any exhibits as originally filed and does not otherwise reflect events occurring after the original filing date of the Annual Report. Accordingly, this Form 10-K/A should be read in conjunction with Meritor s filings with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Annual Report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  REPORT 
  To Meritor WABCO Vehicle Control Systems: 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Meritor WABCO Vehicle Control Systems (the "Company"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2016, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
  Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements 
    
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
    
  Auditors  Responsibility 
  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
    
  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
    
  Opinion 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2016, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

1. FORMATION AND OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE 
    
  Description of the Business   - Meritor WABCO Vehicle Control Systems (the  Company ) (formerly Rockwell WABCO Vehicle Control Systems) was formed on December 7, 1989, as a joint venture between WABCO Automotive Control Systems, Inc. ("WABCO"), a subsidiary of American Standard Inc., and Rockwell Brake Systems, Inc. ( Rockwell ), a subsidiary of Rockwell International (together, the  Partners ), and began operations on February 1, 1990. In 1997, Meritor Automotive, Inc. was spun out of Rockwell. As a part of this transaction, Rockwell s partnership interest in the Company was transferred to Meritor Brake Systems, Inc. On July 31, 2007, WABCO spun from American Standard, Inc. As a part of this transaction, American Standard s partnership interest in the Company was transferred to WABCO. The Company s principal business is the sale of antilock braking and conventional air systems and other vehicle control systems for use primarily on medium and heavy duty trucks, buses, and trailers. Capital contributions and returns are made in equal proportions to maintain each Partner s interest in the Company at 50%. All items of income or expense are allocated to the Partners in proportion to their respective cumulative capital contributions. 
   
    2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Inventories   - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using standard costing, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory at September 30, 2016 and 2015 consists principally of components held for resale and includes approximately $13,214,617 and $17,187,239, respectively, of inventory inbound to the Company, for which risk of loss has transferred to the Company. 
  Property and Equipment   - Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 3 to 25 years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations. Expenditures for betterments or major renewals are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives. 
  Revenue Recognition   - The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. Provisions for customer sales allowance and incentives are recorded as a reduction of sales at the time of product shipment. 
  Income Taxes   - No provision for income taxes has been made, as it is the Partners  responsibility for federal, state, and local income taxes. Taxable income or loss is allocated to the Partners based on their respective ownership percentages, in accordance with the partnership agreement. 
  Fair Value Measurements   - Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Additionally, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that provides the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. Refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the fair value measurements. 
  Capitalized Costs -    The Company capitalized approximately $192,380 of development cost for the year ended September 30, 2016.  Capitalized costs will be amortized as the parts are sold. This is a result of a five year long term agreement for the development costs to be paid back in the piece price.  Amortization of these costs will be reflected as a reduction of Revenue in the Company s Consolidated Statement of net income in fiscal year s ending 2017-2021.  For the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company has not recorded any related amortization expense. 
  Warranty   - A majority of warranty claims are the responsibility of the product supplier, WABCO, and other product suppliers. The Company processes claims on behalf of the product suppliers. However, under a contractual arrangement with WABCO, the reimbursement to the Company of such warranty claims is based on a combination of a flat rate (0.85%) of current year purchases from the product supplier and campaign recoveries from the product supplier. Campaign recoveries are based on the expected claims to be received. As a result of these agreements, the Company incurs warranty expense when the recoveries do not cover the amount of warranty claims processed or expected. Warranty accruals are recorded based on historical claims paid during the warranty period, as a percentage of sales in the year the sale is made. Warranty claim payments have historically  
  
   10 

been highest in the year directly following the build year. This is partially due to the fact that certain products are sold with two year warranty policies. Products that have longer warranty presentation periods have also trended closer to two years, as opposed to three, for recent build years. 
  The amounts deemed recoverable from all product suppliers are $3,657,634 and $7,835,308 as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The current portion of the expected recoveries, $2,120,298 and $4,295,093 is reflected as an offset to accounts payable as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, while the noncurrent portion of the expected recoveries, $1,537,336 and $3,540,215 is a receivable as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  Estimates   - The preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue. 
  Foreign Currency Transactions -   The functional currency of the Company s Mexican operations is the Mexican Peso.  Accounts of the Mexican operations are translated into US dollars using year-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average monthly exchange rates for revenue and expense accounts.  Adjustments resulting from translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive expense, a separate component of partner s capital.  Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, not only with the Company s Mexican operations but also in transactions with related parties as discussed in footnote 3, are included in determining net income. 
  Accounting standards to be implemented 
  In May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The ASU clarifies the assessment of the likelihood that revenue will be collected from a contract, the guidance for presenting sales taxes and similar taxes, and the timing for measuring customer payments that are not in cash. The ASU also establishes a practical expedient for contract modifications at the transition. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, which is not effective yet. The effective date and the transition requirements for the amendments in ASU 2016-12 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in ASU 2014-09 as described below. Therefore, the Company plans to implement this standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018 in connection with its planned implementation of ASU 2014-09 and is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on its financial statements. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting (SEC Update). The ASU was issued to remove from the Codification certain SEC staff guidance that the SEC staff stated would be rescinded: Revenue and Expense Recognition for Freight Services in Process; Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs; and Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (including a Reseller of the Vendor s Products). The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, which is not effective yet. The effective date and the transition requirements for the amendments in ASU 2016-11 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in ASU 2014-09 as described below. Therefore, the Company plans to implement this standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018 in connection with its planned implementation of ASU 2014-09 and is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on its financial statements.  
  In April, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The ASU provides guidance regarding the identification of performance and licensing obligations. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, which is not effective yet. The effective date and the transition requirements for the amendments in ASU 2016-10 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in ASU 2014-09 as described below. Therefore, the Company plans to implement this standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018 in connection with its planned implementation of ASU 2014-09 and is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on its financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) to clarify certain aspects of the principal-versus-agent guidance in its new revenue recognition standard. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in ASU 2016-08 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09. Therefore, the Company plans to implement this standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018 in connection with its planned  

implementation of ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on its financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The update will require lessees to recognize a right of- use asset and lease liability for substantially all leases. The standard is required to be adopted by business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company plans to implement this standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2020 and is currently assessing the potential impact of this new guidance on its financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires entities that measure inventory using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The standard is required to be adopted by business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect a material impact on its financial statements from adoption of this guidance. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), which provides guidance about management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt relating to an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures as applicable. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect a material impact on its financial statements from adoption of this guidance. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which requires companies to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control rather than when companies have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service and requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal periods. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year making it effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal periods, while also providing for early adoption but not before the original effective date. The Company plans to implement this standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018 and is currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on its financial statements. 
   
  3. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  The Company has no employees, but purchases employee and other services from the Partners. Total expenses for services from related parties during the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, recorded in cost of goods sold and other operating expenses were as follows: 

Additionally, during the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recorded transactions of approximately $182,179,250, $232,088,071, and $204,371,222, respectively, which primarily relate to purchases of productive inventory from WABCO. Also, the Company recorded sales of approximately $90,260,794, $89,356,713, and $86,085,550, respectively, primarily to Meritor. 
  The Company purchases a significant portion of productive inventory from related parties in Europe. All purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company has an agreement with certain of these related parties, whereby if the difference between the currency exchange rate at the time of purchase and an agreed upon currency exchange rate exceeds 3%, the purchase price is adjusted so that the currency exchange effect exceeding 3% is shared equally by both parties. The Company and the related parties settle all transactions on a monthly basis. The Company records the purchase price adjustments in cost of goods sold which were approximately $566,353 in 2016, $3,306,019 in 2015, mostly due to the fluctuation of the Euro and was insignificant in 2014. 

4. SALES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO MAJOR CUSTOMERS 
    
  The Company had significant sales to three unrelated major customers in 2016, 2015, and 2014. Sales made to these customers as a percentage of total sales made by the Company during 2016, 2015, and 2014, are disclosed in the table below. In addition, accounts receivable from these customers as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions), are disclosed in the table below. 

A majority of the Company s sales are to manufacturers of heavy-duty trucks and trailers. Many of the Company s automotive industry customers are unionized, and work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by them could have an adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. Substantially, all of the receivables are from companies operating in the domestic transportation equipment industry. 
   
  5. WARRANTY AND POLICY 
    
  Warranty accruals are recorded based on historical claims paid and as a percentage of sales in the year the sale is made. Warranties not expected to be paid within one year are recorded as a noncurrent liability. 
  The changes in the total carrying amount of the Company s warranty and policy liability for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014 are shown below.

8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  ASC 820 provides a definition of fair value, establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets, Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable, and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists; therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These consist of investments in money market mutual funds recorded within cash and cash equivalents. These funds are valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. The mutual funds held by the Company are deemed to be actively traded. 
  Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of September 30, 2016,  were as follows: 
                                              
    Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets

$ 

$ 

There were no financial assets or liabilities carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  Transfers Between Levels   - The availability of observable market data is monitored to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.  Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.  In such instances the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.   
  The Company evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets. For the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, there were no transfers between levels.

              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
