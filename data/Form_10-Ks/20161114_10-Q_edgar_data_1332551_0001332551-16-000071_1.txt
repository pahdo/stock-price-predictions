NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION    
  Resource Capital Corp. and its subsidiaries  (collectively the "Company") originate, purchase and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate ("CRE") debt investments.  The Company s investment activities are managed by Resource Capital Manager, Inc. ("Manager") pursuant to a management agreement (the "Management Agreement").  The Manager is a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Resource America, Inc. ("Resource America") (formerly traded on NASDAQ: REXI). On September 8, 2016, Resource America was acquired by C-III Capital Partners LLC ("C-III"), a commercial real estate services company engaged in a broad range of activities, including primary and special loan servicing, loan origination, fund management, collateralized debt obligation ("CDO") management, principal investment, investment sales and multifamily property management.   As part of the transaction, C-III took over control of the Manager with respect to the Management Agreement and became the beneficial owner of the Company s common shares owned by Resource America, approximately   2.3%   of the Company s outstanding shares as of   September 30, 2016  .   
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the amendments to the consolidation guidance as outlined in Note 2.  As a result of its evaluation, the Company determined that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of the following VIEs and, therefore, deconsolidated these entities: Resource Real Estate Funding CDO 2006-1, Ltd. ("RREF CDO 2006-1"), Resource Real Estate Funding CDO 2007-1, Ltd. ("RREF CDO 2007-1"), Apidos Cinco CDO, Ltd. ("Apidos Cinco CDO"), Pelium Capital Partners, L.P., ("Pelium Capital") and RCM Global, LLC ("RCM Global").  
       
  On July 1, 2016, the Company underwent an internal tax restructuring in order to reduce the costs associated with ownership of multiple legal entities, simplify its overall legal entity structure, ease deployment of cash throughout the business for operations and opportunities and consolidate operations into one centralized entity or group of entities. As a result of this tax restructuring, several of the Company s directly owned subsidiaries converted from corporations to single member LLCs. Also, the following directly owned subsidiaries of the Company merged into RCC Residential Portfolio TRS, Inc. ("RCC Resi TRS") and were dissolved upon the restructuring: Long Term Care Conversion, Inc. ("LTCC") and Resource TRS II, Inc. ("Resource TRS II"). On October 1, 2016, RCC Residential, Inc. ("RCC Residential") merged into RCC Resi TRS.     
  The following subsidiaries are consolidated in the Company s financial statements: 
             
    RCC Real Estate, Inc. ("RCC Real Estate") holds real estate investments, including commercial real estate loans, commercial real estate-related securities and direct investments in real estate.  RCC Real Estate owns   100%   of the equity of the following VIEs: 
                
    RREF CDO 2006-1, a Cayman Islands limited liability company and qualified real estate investment trust ("REIT") subsidiary ("QRS").  RREF CDO 2006-1 was established to complete a collateralized debt obligation ("CDO") issuance secured by a portfolio of CRE loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS").  This entity was deconsolidated as of January 1, 2016 and the retained investment is accounted for as an investment security, available-for-sale (  see Note 2  ) in the Company's consolidated financial statements.  On April 25, 2016, RREF CDO 2006-1 was liquidated and, in exchange for the Company's interests in RREF CDO 2006-1, the remaining assets of the CDO were distributed to the Company, comprised of investment securities available-for-sale and loans held for investment, which were recorded at fair value. 
                
    RREF CDO 2007-1, a Cayman Islands limited liability company and QRS.  RREF CDO 2007-1 was established to complete a CDO issuance secured by a portfolio of CRE loans and CMBS.  This entity was deconsolidated as of January 1, 2016 and the retained investment is now accounted for as an investment security, available-for-sale (  see Note 2  ) in the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
                
    Resource Capital Corp. CRE Notes 2013, Ltd. ("RCC CRE Notes 2013"), a Cayman Islands limited liability company and QRS, was established to complete a CRE securitization issuance secured by a portfolio of CRE loans.

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (unaudited) 

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
  Reverse Stock Split and Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation  
  Effective August 31, 2015, the Company completed a one-for-four reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock. The accompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented.  In addition, the Company adopted an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which provides that its authorized capital stock consists of   125,000,000   shares of common stock,   $0.001   par value per share, and   100,000,000   shares of preferred stock,   $0.001   par value per share.  
  Principles of Consolidation  
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and the accounting policies set forth in Note 2 included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company.  All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   $111.2 million   and   $74.3 million   of the reported cash balances exceeded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance limit of $250,000 per institution, subjecting the Company to risk related to the uninsured balance.  All of the Company's cash deposits are held at large, established financial institutions.   
  Income Taxes 
  Due to changes in management s focus regarding the non-CRE businesses, the Company determined that it no longer expects to have sufficient forecasted taxable income to completely realize the tax benefits of the gross deferred tax asset of   $56.5 million   (tax effected   $21.9 million  ) as of September 30, 2016.  The Company believes it will be able to utilize up to   $15.4 million   of the gross deferred tax asset prior to its expiration.  Therefore, a gross valuation allowance of   $41.1 million   (tax effected expense of   $16.3 million  ) has been recorded against the deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2016.  Management will continue to assess its estimate of the amount of deferred tax asset that the Company expects to utilize.  The net income tax expense recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was   $12.3 million   which consists of   $4.0 million   of tax benefits attributable to operating loss incurred during the quarter and a   $16.3 million   valuation allowance. 
  Recent Accounting Standards 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to reduce the diversity in practice around the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues : debt prepayments or extinguishment costs; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with insignificant coupon rates; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which will change how credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are measured at fair value through net income are determined.  The new guidance will replace the current incurred loss approach with an expected loss model for instruments measured at amortized cost.  For available-for-sale debt securities, the guidance requires recording allowances rather than reducing the carrying amount, as it is currently under the other-than-temporary impairment model.  It also simplifies the accounting model for credit-impaired debt securities and loans.  This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that reporting period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements.  The new guidance allows for entities to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. In addition, the guidance allows employers to withhold shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements up to the employees  maximum individual tax rate without causing the award to be classified as a liability.  The guidance also stipulates that cash paid by an employer to a taxing authority when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows.  This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases.  Lessor accounting will remain largely unchanged.  The guidance will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the timing, amount and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  This guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and its impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments in order to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information.  The guidance requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.  It is effective for annual reporting periods, and the interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted for certain provisions.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adoption. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, which are currently recognized on a retrospective basis.  Under the new requirements, adjustments to provisional amounts will be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined.  The effects of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income arising from changes to the provisional amounts, if any, are included in earnings of the reporting period in which the adjustments to the provisional amounts are determined.  An entity is also required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  It is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.  Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update.  It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company has early adopted the provisions of this guidance.  Note 12,   Borrowings  , reflects the presentation of debt issuance costs as prescribed by this accounting standards update.  Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires an entity to evaluate whether it should consolidate certain legal entities.  All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model.  Specifically, the amendments: (1) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs; (2) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; (3) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related-party relationships; and (4) provide a scope exception from

consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.  This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the above guidance as required.  As a result of its re-evaluation, the Company determined it was no longer the primary beneficiary of the following VIEs and, therefore, they were deconsolidated: RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1, Apidos Cinco CDO, Pelium Capital, and RCM Global.  As a result of these deconsolidations, the Company no longer reflects the underlying collateral (loans and securities) of those VIEs in its consolidated financial statements. Instead, the Company prospectively reflects in its consolidated balance sheet, its direct investments (the "retained investments") in the issued and outstanding securities of those VIEs.  The Company's retained investments in RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1, Apidos Cinco CDO are now accounted for as investment securities, available-for-sale and, as a result, are marked-to-market while the Company's retained investments in Pelium Capital and RCM Global are accounted for as equity method investments.  The Company has elected to retrospectively reflect the deconsolidation of these entities on a modified basis, which resulted in a reduction to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2016, of   $16.9 million  .  The reduction to retained earnings represents the effect of marking the investments to market value as of the date of the adoption. 
  The following table summarizes the net impact of the deconsolidation of the   five   VIEs upon adoption on January 1, 2016 (in thousands) net of eliminations: 

(2) 
    As part of the deconsolidation of Apidos Cinco CDO,   $1.3 million   of specific reserves on the bank loans were deconsolidated as of January 1, 2016. 
              (3) 
    As part of the deconsolidation of RREF CDO 2006-1 and RREF CDO 2007-1, the Company deconsolidated   four   loans representing the senior participations in commercial real estate loans totaling   $91.3 million   that were previously disclosed as both impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2015.

In November 2014, the FASB issued guidance to eliminate the use of different methods in practice and thereby reduce existing diversity under GAAP in the accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of shares.  An entity that issues or invests in a hybrid financial instrument is required to separate an embedded derivative feature from the host contract (for example, an underlying share) and account for the feature as a derivative according to Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 815-10 on derivatives and hedging if certain criteria are met.  This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.  Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
  In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the disclosures management must make in its interim and annual financial statement footnotes when management has determined that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable).  In accordance with this guidance, management s assessment is required to be made each reporting period and should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date the financial statements are issued.  In all cases, to the extent that substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern is determined to be probable, management must disclose the principal conditions or events that gave rise to the substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, management s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity s ability to meet its obligations, and management s plans that either alleviate or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that gave rise to the substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  Additionally, to the extent substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern is not alleviated by management s plans, management must indicate in the footnotes that there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adoption. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance that provides for the election of a measurement alternative when a reporting entity determines that it is the primary beneficiary of a collateralized financing entity and, hence, is required to consolidate that collateralized financing entity.  The measurement alternative allows a qualifying consolidated collateralized financing entity to use the more observable of the fair value of the financial assets or the fair value of the financial liabilities adjusted by the carrying amount of non-financial assets and the fair value of any beneficial interests retained by the reporting entity (including those beneficial interests that represent compensation for services).  Alternatively, if the measurement alternative is not elected for a qualifying consolidated collateralized financing entity, this guidance requires that the financial assets and financial liabilities be measured in accordance with ASC Topic 820, and that any difference in the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities be reflected in earnings and attributed to the reporting entity in the consolidated statement of operations.  This guidance was effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
  Reclassifications 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to the   2015   consolidated financial statements to conform to the   2016   presentation. 
   
  NOTE 3 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES    
    
  The Company has evaluated its securities, loans, investments in unconsolidated entities, liabilities to subsidiary trusts issuing preferred securities (consisting of unsecured junior subordinated notes), securitizations, guarantees and other financial contracts in order to determine if they are variable interests in VIEs.  The Company regularly monitors these legal interests and contracts and, to the extent it has determined that it has a variable interest, analyzes the related entity for potential consolidation.  A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which, generally, is the entity that has the power to direct the activities that are most significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  The Company continuously analyzes entities in which it holds variable interests, including when there is a reconsideration event, to determine whether such entities are VIEs and whether such potential VIEs should be consolidated or deconsolidated.  This analysis requires considerable judgment.  
  Consolidated VIEs (the Company is the primary beneficiary)  
  Based on management s analysis, the Company is the primary beneficiary of   seven   VIEs at   September 30, 2016  :  Apidos CDO I, Apidos CDO III, Whitney CLO I, RCC CRE Notes 2013, RCC 2014-CRE2, RCC 2015-CRE3 and RCC 2015-CRE4 (collectively

the "Consolidated VIEs"). The Consolidated VIEs were formed on behalf of the Company to invest in real estate-related securities, CMBS, property available-for-sale, bank loans, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities and were financed by the issuance of debt securities.  The Manager manages the commercial real estate-related entities on behalf of the Company, and CVC Credit Partners manages the commercial finance-related entities on behalf of the Company.  By financing these assets with long-term borrowings through the issuance of bonds, the Company seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted equity returns and to match the term of its assets and liabilities.  The primary beneficiary determination for each of these VIEs was made at each VIE s inception and is continually assessed. All of the Company's VIEs were reevaluated under the revised consolidation model effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 (see Note 2). 
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company was the primary beneficiary of   thirteen   VIEs: Apidos CDO I, Apidos CDO III, Apidos Cinco CDO, Apidos CLO VIII, RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1, Whitney CLO I, RCC CRE Notes 2013, RCC 2014-CRE2, RCC 2015-CRE3, RCC 2015-CRE4, Moselle CLO and RCM Global (collectively, the "Consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2015").  In performing the primary beneficiary analysis for the Consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2015, it was determined that the parties that have the power to direct the activities that are most significant to each of these VIEs and that had the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to these VIEs, were a related-party group.  It was then determined that the Company was the party within that group that was more closely associated with each such VIE considering the design of the VIE, the principal-agency relationship between the Company and other members of the related-party group, and the relationship and significance of the activities of the VIE to the Company compared to the other members of the related-party group.  Apidos CDO I, Apidos CDO III, Apidos Cinco CDO, Apidos CLO VIII, RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1, RCC CRE Notes 2013, RCC 2014-CRE2, RCC 2015-CRE3 and RCC 2015-CRE4 were formed on behalf of the Company to invest in real estate-related securities, CMBS, property available-for-sale, bank loans, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities and were financed by the issuance of debt securities.  The Manager manages the commercial real estate-related entities on behalf of the Company, and CVC Credit Partners manages the commercial finance-related entities on behalf of the Company.  The primary beneficiary determination for each of these VIEs was made at each VIE s inception and is continually assessed.  
  Moselle CLO was a European securitization in which the Company purchased a   $30.4 million   interest in the form of subordinate notes representing   100%   of the Class 1 Subordinated Notes and   67.9%   of the Class 2 Subordinated Notes in February 2014.  The CLO was managed by an independent third-party, and such collateral management activities were determined to be the activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of the CLO.  Though neither the Company nor   one   of its related parties managed the CLO, due to certain unilateral kick-out rights within the collateral management agreement it was determined that the Company had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of Moselle CLO.  Having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Moselle CLO and a financial interest that was expected to absorb both positive and negative variability in the CLO that could potentially be significant, the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of Moselle CLO and, therefore, consolidated the CLO.  During the fourth quarter of 2014, the CLO began the liquidation process and all assets were subsequently sold.  The Company's interest in the Moselle CLO Subordinated Notes was fully redeemed in March 2016.  
  Whitney CLO I was a securitization in which the Company acquired rights to manage the collateral assets held by the entity in February 2011.  For a discussion on the primary beneficiary analysis for Whitney, see    Unconsolidated VIEs   Resource Capital Asset Management,  below.  
    
  For a discussion of the Company s consolidated securitizations,   see Note 1  , and for a discussion of the debt issued through the securitizations,   see Note 12  .  
  For consolidated CLOs in which the Company does not own   100%   of the subordinated notes, the Company imputes an interest rate using expected cash flows over the life of the CLO and records the third party's share of the cash flows as interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
  The Company has exposure to losses on its securitizations to the extent of its subordinated debt and preferred equity interests in them.  The Company is entitled to receive payments of principal and interest on the debt securities it holds and, to the extent revenues exceed debt service requirements and other expenses of the securitizations, distributions with respect to its preferred equity interests.  As a result of consolidation, debt and equity interests the Company holds in these securitizations have been eliminated, and the Company s consolidated balance sheets reflects both the assets held and debt issued by the securitizations to third parties and any accrued expense to third parties.  The Company's operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts related to the securitizations' assets and liabilities as opposed to the Company's net economic interests in the securitizations.  Assets and liabilities related to the securitizations are disclosed, in the aggregate, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

The creditors of the Company s   seven   consolidated VIEs have no recourse to the general credit of the Company.   During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company provided no financial support to any of its VIEs nor does it have any requirement to do so, although it may choose to do so in the future to maximize future cash flows on such investments by the Company.  There are no explicit arrangements that obligate the Company to provide financial support to any of its consolidated VIEs.  
  The following table shows the classification and carrying value of assets and liabilities of the Company's consolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1)    Includes   $2.9 million   designated to fund future commitments on specific commercial real estate loans in certain of the securitizations. 
  (2)    Assets of each of the consolidated VIEs may only be used to settle the obligations of each respective VIE. 
    
  Unconsolidated VIEs (the Company is not the primary beneficiary, but has a variable interest)  
  Based on management s analysis, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs discussed below since it does not have both (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE.  Accordingly, the following VIEs are not consolidated in the Company s financial statements as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company s maximum exposure to risk for each of these unconsolidated VIEs is set forth in the  Maximum Exposure to Loss  column in the table below.  
    
  RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1 and Apidos Cinco CDO 
  RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1 and Apidos Cinco CDO were formed on behalf of the Company to invest in real estate-related securities, CMBS, property available-for-sale, bank loans, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities and were financed by the issuance of debt securities.  The Manager manages the commercial real estate-related entities on behalf of the Company, and CVC Credit Partners manages the commercial finance-related entities on behalf of the Company.  By financing these assets with long-term borrowings through the issuance of bonds, the Company seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted equity returns and to match the term of its assets and liabilities.  The primary beneficiary determination for each of these VIEs was made at each VIE s inception and is continually assessed.  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the amendments to the consolidation guidance as outlined in   Note 2  .  As a result of its evaluation, the Company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as its investments in these vehicles do not provide the Company with a controlling financial interest.  As a results of its evaluation, these investments were deconsolidated.  At deconsolidation, the Company recorded its investments in RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1 and Apidos Cinco CDO at fair value and accounts for these investments as investment securities available-for-sale in its consolidated financial statements.  On April 25, 2016, the Company called and liquidated its investment in RREF CDO 2006-1 and, in exchange for the Company's interest in RREF CDO 2006-1, the Company distributed the remaining assets of   $65.6 million   at fair value after paying off the CDO debt owed to third parties of   $7.5 million  .  The Company recognized a gain of approximately   $846,000   as a result of this transaction.    On September 28, 2016, Apidos Cinco CDO s trustee issued a notice to call the CDO.

RCM Global, LLC  
    
  On July 9, 2014, RCC Residential, together with Resource America and certain Resource America employees, acquired through RCM Global a portfolio of securities from JP Morgan for   $23.5 million  .  The portfolio is managed by Resource America.  RCC Residential   c  ontributed   $15.0 million   for a   63.8%   membership interest.    E  ach of the members of RCM Global is allocated revenues and expenses of RCM Global in accordance with his or her membership interest.  RCM Global was determined to be a VIE based on the equity holders' inability to direct the activities that are most significant to the entity.  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the amendments to the consolidation guidance as outlined in   Note 2  .  Upon adoption, the Company reevaluated its variable interest in RCM Global and determined it would not be the primary beneficiary of RCM Global, as its investment in the limited liability company does not provide the Company with a controlling financial interest.  As a result of its evaluation, the Company deconsolidated its investment in RCM Global.  As of January 1, 2016, the Company accounted for its investment in RCM Global as an investment in an unconsolidated entity in its consolidated financial statements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company holds a   28.6%   interest in RCM Global. 
    
  Pelium Capital  
    
  In September 2014, the Company contributed   $17.5 million   to Pelium Capital for an initial ownership interest of   80.4%  . Pelium Capital is a specialized credit opportunity fund managed by Resource America. The Company funded its final commitment of $  2.5 million  , as of February 1, 2015.  The Company will receive   10%   of the carried interest in the partnership for the first   five   years which can increase its interest to   20%   if the Company's capital contributions aggregate   $40.0 million  .  Resource America contributed cash of   $2.8 million   to the formation of Pelium Capital.  At December 31, 2015, Pelium Capital was accounted for as a consolidated voting interest subsidiary. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the amendments to the consolidation guidance as outlined in   Note 2  .  Upon adoption, the Company reevaluated its interest in Pelium Capital and determined that although it now possessed a variable interest in Pelium Capital, it would not be the primary beneficiary of Pelium Capital, as its investment in the limited liability company does not provide the Company with a controlling financial interest.  As a result of its reevaluation, the Company deconsolidated its investment in Pelium Capital on January 1, 2016, and accounted for its investment in Pelium Capital as an investment in an unconsolidated entity in its consolidated financial statements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company holds an   80.2%   interest in Pelium Capital. 
  Pearlmark Mezzanine Realty Partners IV, L.P.  
  On June 24, 2015, the Company committed up to   $50.0 million   in Pearlmark Mezzanine Realty Partners IV, L.P. ("Pearlmark Mezz"), a Delaware limited partnership created to acquire and manage financial interests in commercial real estate property.  The contractual fund manager of the fund is Pearlmark Real Estate LLC ("Pearlmark"), a Delaware limited liability company that is   50%   owned by Resource America.  The Company determined it possessed a variable interest  Pearlmark Mezz, however, it would not be the primary beneficiary of Pearlmark Mezz, as its investment in the limited liability company does not provide the Company with a controlling financial interest. The Company will pay Pearlmark Mezz management fees of   1.0%   on the unfunded committed capital and   1.5%   on the invested capital. The Company is entitled to a management fee rebate of   25%   for the first year of the fund. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has an investment balance of   $16.8 million   and a   47.7%   ownership interest in the fund. 
  LEAF Commercial Capital, Inc.  
  On November 16, 2011, the Company together with LEAF Financial, Inc. ("LEAF Financial"), a subsidiary of Resource America, and LEAF Commercial Capital, Inc. ( LCC ), another subsidiary of Resource America, entered into a stock purchase agreement and related agreements (collectively the  SPA ) with Eos Partners, L.P., a private investment firm, and its affiliates ( Eos ).  In exchange for its prior interests in its lease related investments, the Company received   31,341   shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock"),   4,872   shares of newly issued   8%   Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred Stock") and   2,364   shares of newly issued Series D Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "Series D Preferred Stock"), collectively representing, on a fully-diluted basis, assuming conversion, a   26.7%   interest in LCC.  At the time of investment, the Company s investment in LCC was valued at   $36.3 million   based on a third-party valuation.  During 2013, the Company entered into a third stock purchase agreement with LCC to purchase   3,682   shares of newly issued Series A-1 Preferred Stock (the "Series A-1 Preferred Stock") for   $3.7 million   and   4,445   shares of newly issued Series E Preferred Stock (the "Series E Preferred Stock") for   $4.4 million  .  The Series E Preferred Stock expired and the Company was issued additional Series A-1 Preferred Stock in exchange for its investment in the Series E Preferred Stock.  The Company's fully-diluted interest in LCC, assuming conversion, was   29.0%   at   September 30, 2016  .  The Company s investment in LCC was recorded at   $44.8 million   and   $42.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of LCC because it does not participate in any management or portfolio decisions, holds only   two   of   six   board positions, and only controls   29.0%   of the voting rights in the entity.  Furthermore, Eos holds consent rights with

respect to significant LCC actions, including the incurrence of indebtedness, consummation of a sale of the entity, liquidation or initiating a public offering (see   Note 17  ). 
  Unsecured Junior Subordinated Debentures  
  The Company has a   100%   interest in the common shares of Resource Capital Trust I ( RCT I ) and RCC Trust II ( RCT II ), valued at   $1.5 million   in the aggregate (or   3%   of each trust). RCT I and RCT II were formed for the purposes of providing debt financing to the Company, as described below.  The Company completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not it is the primary beneficiary of each of the trusts and determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of either trust because it does not have the power to direct the activities most significant to the trusts, which include the collection of principal and interest and protection of collateral through servicing rights.  Accordingly, neither trust is consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  The Company records its investments in RCT I and RCT II s common shares as investments in unconsolidated trusts using the cost method and records dividend income when declared by RCT I and RCT II.  The trusts each hold subordinated debentures for which the Company is the obligor in the amount of   $25.8 million   for RCT I and   $25.8 million   for RCT II.  The debentures were funded by the issuance of trust preferred securities of RCT I and RCT II.  The Company will continuously reassess whether it should be deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the trusts.  
  Resource Capital Asset Management CLOs 
  In February 2011, the Company purchased a company that managed bank loan assets through   five   CLOs.  As a result, the Company became entitled to collect senior, subordinated and incentive management fees from these CLOs.  The purchase price of   $22.5 million   resulted in an intangible asset that was allocated to each of the   five   CLOs and is amortized over the expected life of each CLO.  The unamortized balance of the intangible asset was   $512,000   and   $5.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company recognized fee income of   $553,000   and   $1.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The Company recognized fee income of   $791,000   and   $2.7 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  With respect to   four   of these CLOs, the Company determined that it does not hold a controlling financial interest and, therefore, is not the primary beneficiary.    One   of the CLOs was liquidated in February 2013.  In January 2016, a second RCAM-managed CLO was called and   $2.4 million   of impairment, on a pre-tax basis, was recorded in depreciation and amortization on the Company's consolidated statements of operations on the related intangible asset, as of December 31, 2015.  In September 2016, the third RCAM-managed CLO was called and   $1.5 million   of impairment, on a pre-tax basis, was recorded in impairment losses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations on the related intangible asset, during the three months ended September, 30 2016.  In September 2016, the Company recorded impairment on the   one   remaining CLO of   $2.2 million  , on a pre-tax basis, on the related intangible asset on which the Company anticipates redemption in early 2017. 
  With respect to the fifth CLO, Whitney CLO I, in October 2012, the Company purchased   66.6%   of its preferred equity, which resulted in consolidation.  Based upon that purchase, the Company determined that it had an obligation to absorb losses and/or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Whitney CLO I and that a related party had the power to direct the activities that are most significant to the VIE.  As a result, together with the related party, the Company had both the power to direct and the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses.  It was then determined that, between the Company and the related party, the Company was the party within that group that was more closely associated with Whitney CLO I because of its preferred equity interest in Whitney CLO I.  The Company, therefore, consolidated Whitney CLO I.  In May 2013, the Company purchased additional equity in this CLO which increased its ownership of the outstanding preferred equity to   68.3%  .  In September 2013, the Company liquidated Whitney CLO I, and, as a result, all of the assets were sold.   
  Investment in ZAIS 
  In February 2015, the Company made an investment in ZAIS CLO 4 Limited, an offshore financing vehicle created to acquire and warehouse syndicated bank loans, through its wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary ZAIS and through its unconsolidated subsidiary Pelium Capital together with a Resource America employee.  The Company, through ZAIS and Pelium Capital, committed to invest   $10.0 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively, during the vehicle's warehousing period.  The warehouse credit facility closed on May 5, 2016, at which time, Resource TRS III purchased a beneficial interest in ZAIS CLO 4.  The vehicle is managed by ZAIS Leveraged Loan Manager 4, LLC (the  Collateral Manager ), an entity unrelated to the Company or to Pelium Capital, and such collateral management activities were determined to be the activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of the entity.  The Collateral Manager can be replaced either for cause by the entity s administrative agent if there is an event of default or by a unanimous vote of the entity s equity investors, excluding any preference shares held by the Collateral Manager or its affiliates.  Although the Company has an investment in the entity that is potentially significant, because it was determined that the Company did not have

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a beneficial interest of   $10.6 million   in ZAIS CLO 4.

  Investments in the Harvest CLO Securities             
  In September 2013 and March 2014, the Company made investments in Harvest CLO VII Limited and Harvest CLO VIII Limited (collectively, the  Harvest Securities ), respectively, offshore limited liability companies created to acquire syndicated bank loans and issue collateral loan obligations, through its wholly-owned, direct subsidiary Commercial II.

The Portfolio Manager can be replaced only for cause by the Harvest Securities  trustee.  Although the Company has investments in the Harvest Securities that are potentially significant, because it was determined that the Company did not have the ability to unilaterally kick out the Portfolio Manager, the Company was not determined to be the primary beneficiary and, hence, not required to consolidate the Harvest Securities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had investments of   $4.4 million   in Harvest CLO VII Limited and   $5.2 million   in Harvest CLO VIII Limited.  The Company accounts for its investments in the Harvest Securities as investment securities available-for-sale in its consolidated financial statements. 
  Investment in Harvest CLO XV Designated Activity Company 
  In September 2015, the Company made an investment in Harvest CLO XV Designated Activity Company ("Harvest XV"), an offshore financing vehicle created to acquire and warehouse syndicated bank loans, through its wholly-owned, direct subsidiary Commercial II.  In May 2016, the warehouse closed and the Company invested in Harvest CLO XV DAC ("Harvest CLO XV").  The CLO is managed by the Portfolio Manager, and such collateral management activities were determined to be the activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of the entity.  The Portfolio Manager can be replaced only for cause by the entity s administrative agent.  Although the Company has an investment in the entity that is potentially significant, because it was determined that the Company did not have the ability to unilaterally kick out the collateral manager, the Company was not determined to be the primary beneficiary and, hence, not required to consolidate Harvest CLO XV.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's investment in Harvest CLO XV is   $14.0 million  . The Company accounts for its investment in Harvest CLO XV as an investment security available-for-sale in its consolidated financial statements.

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   $21.6 million   of other-than-temporary impairment on its investment securities available-for-sale.  
  Of this amount,   $20.7 million   relates to the Company s previously consolidated CRE CDO, RREF 2007-1, which is classified as an investment security available-for-sale.  The Company s security interest in the vehicle is supported by   12   CMBS securities and   seven   CRE loans.  As part of the Company's ongoing credit evaluation of its investment securities, third-party appraisals were obtained on   six   of the   seven   remaining legacy CRE loans, which are part of the asset pool of the vehicle.  The remaining loan was under an agreement of sale.  As a result of having the properties supporting the loans appraised,   two   of the CRE loans in the vehicle were determined to have cost bases in excess of their expected cash flows, as a result of the updated appraisals, causing a collective impairment charge to the cash flows of the vehicle of   $20.7 million  .  The impairment charge on the security reflects the credit impact to the fair value of the security given the results of the updated appraisals and reduces the Company's cost basis in the security permanently.  The impairment charge was calculated by comparing the previous projected cash flows of the security to the revised cash flows including the results of the updated appraisals.  
   The Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment of   $241,000   on   three   positions classified as securities available-for-sale, RMBS during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   after it was determined the Company would not be able to recover the full cost basis of these positions due to declines in the future projected cash flows of the securities.   
  One   CMBS position classified as a security available for sale with a par balance of   $4.0 million   was identified as a position the Company would be required to sell before it could recover its cost basis in the security.  As such, the Company recorded the difference between its amortized cost basis and the estimated fair value.  Other-than-temporary impairment of   $732,000   was recognized during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as a result of the anticipated sale of this security. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized   no   other-than-temporary impairment on its investment securities available-for-sale. 
  The following table summarizes the Company's sales of investment securities available-for-sale (in thousands, except number of securities): 

There were   no   sales or redemptions during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Credit quality indicators 
  Commercial Real Estate Loans  
  Loans are graded at inception and updates to assigned grades are made continually as new information is received.  As a result, a loan previously rated 4 may, over time and with improved performance, be rated better than 4. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 4 with 1 representing the Company s highest rating and 4 representing its lowest rating. Commercial real estate loans are first individually evaluated for impairment. To the extent no individual impairment is determined, a general reserve is established.  
    
  The characteristics of each rating category are as follows: 
    
           1. 
    A loan with a rating of a 1 is considered to have satisfactory performance with no issues noted. All interest and principal payments are current and the probability of loss is remote; 
              2. 
    A loan is graded with a rating of a 2 if a surveillance trigger event has occurred, but loss is not probable at this time. Such trigger events could include but are not limited to a trending decrease in occupancy rates or a flattening of lease revenues; and to a lesser extent, ground lease defaults, ground lease expirations that occur in the next six months or the borrower is delinquent on payment of property taxes or insurance.; 
              3. 
    A loan with a rating of 3 has experienced an extended decline in operating performance, a significant deviation from its origination plan or the occurrence of one or more surveillance trigger events which create an increased risk for potential default.  Loans identified in this category show some liquidity concerns. However, the risk of loss is not specifically assignable to any individual loan. The noted risk of the loans in this category is generally covered by general reserves; 
              4. 
    A loan with a rating of a 4 is considered to be in payment default or default is expected, full recovery of the unpaid principal balance is improbable and loss is considered probable. The noted risk of the loans in this category is covered by specific reserves. 
      Credit risk profiles of commercial real estate loans were as follows (in thousands): 

(1) 
    The Company has one mezzanine loan with a par value of   $28.8 million   that was acquired at a fair value of   zero   as a result of the liquidation of RREF 2006-1. 
         
  As part of the Company s ongoing loan monitoring, third-party appraisal services were obtained on   six   legacy CRE loans during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  As a result of the evaluation of those appraisals, it was determined that two loans previously disclosed as impaired loans, one in Studio City, CA with an amortized cost of   $27.5 million   and the other in Tucson, AZ with an amortized cost of   $2.0 million  , had cost bases in excess of their appraised values. As such, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded specific provisions of   $6.1 million   on the Studio City, CA loan and   $2.0 million   on the Tucson, AZ loan.  Previously, the Studio City, CA loan was under contract for sale at a value in excess of the Company's loan amount.  The contract for sale was terminated in October 2016.  The Tucson, AZ loan was previously supported by a broker s opinion of value received as of December 31, 2015.  The updated appraisal, after factoring in modified terms with

the operating manager, and adjustments to projected occupancy and the average daily rate, returned a fair value below our cost basis, resulting in the full impairment of the portion of this whole loan held directly on balance sheet.  A portion of this whole loan is also held in RREF CDO 2007-1.  The provisions recorded against these loans reflect the estimated recoverable value.  These and other assets in the loan pool continue to be monitored consistent with the Company s impairment evaluation process. 
  The Company also had   six   loans classified as rating 2 due to surveillance triggers being registered.  Of the   six   loans, several will be classified as loans held for sale as of December 31, 2016 (  see Note 24  ).  The other   two   loans had surveillance trigger events due to a mechanics lien and a code violation.  These   two   loans were not considered impaired as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  All of the Company's commercial real estate loans were current with exception of   one   mezzanine loan that had defaulted as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  This loan was deconsolidated as part of the Company's adoption of amendments to consolidation accounting guidance as required on January 1, 2016 (see Note 2).  However, as a result of RREF CDO 2006-1 being called and liquidated on April 25, 2016, par value of   $28.8 million   of this mezzanine loan was acquired as part of the liquidation proceeds and is reflected on the Company's balance sheet at a fair value of   zero   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Bank Loans 
  Loans are graded at inception and updates to assigned grades are made continually as new information is received. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 representing the Company s highest rating and 5 representing its lowest rating. Bank loans are first individually evaluated for impairment. To the extent no individual impairment is determined, a general reserve is established.  
  The characteristics of each rating category are as follows: 
           1. 
    Loans with a rating of 1 are considered performing within expectations. All interest and principal payments are current, all future payments are anticipated and loss is not probable;   
              2. 
    Loans with a rating of a 2 are considered to have limited liquidity concerns and are watched closely.  Loans identified in this category show remote signs of liquidity concerns, loss is not probable and therefore no reserve is established; 
              3. 
    Loans with a rating of a 3 are considered to have possible future liquidity concerns.  Loans identified in this category show some liquidity concerns, but the ability to estimate potential defaults is not quantifiable and therefore no reserve is established; 
              4. 
    Loans with a rating of a 4 are considered to have nearer term liquidity concerns.  These loans have a reasonable possibility of future default. However, the risk of loss is not assignable to one specific credit. The noted risk of the loans in this category is covered by general reserves; and 
              5. 
    Loans with a rating of a 5 have defaulted in payment of principal and interest or default is imminent.  It is probable that impairment has occurred on these loans based on their payment status and that impairment is estimable.  The noted risk of the loans in this category is covered by specific reserves. 
     Credit risk profiles of bank loans were as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016   all of the Company's bank loans were deconsolidated (see Note 2).  As of   December 31, 2015  , all of the Company's bank loans were current with respect to debt service with the exception of   one   loan with an amortized aggregate cost of   $1.5 million  , on which there was a reserve.  
  Middle Market Loans 
  At inception, all middle market loans are graded at a 2.  Updates to assigned grades are made continually as new information is received. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 representing the Company s highest rating and 5 representing its lowest rating. Middle market loans are only evaluated individually for impairment.

The characteristics of each rating category are as follows: 
    
           1. 
    A loan with a rating of a 1 is considered performing above expectations and the likelihood of loss is remote; 
              2. 
    A loan with a rating of a 2 is considered performing within expectations and the likelihood of loss is remote;  
              3. 
    A loan with a rating of a 3 is considered performing below expectations and requires close monitoring but no loss of interest or principal is expected. Loans receiving this rating may be out of compliance with financial covenants; however, these loans are current with respect to interest and principal;  
              4. 
    A loan with a rating of a 4 is considered performing below expectations and some loss of interest or dividend is expected but no loss of principal. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not more than 180 days past due;  and  
              5. 
    A loan with a rating of a 5 is considered performing substantially below expectations, in default and some loss of principal is expected. The borrower is out of compliance with most or all of the debt covenants and payments are substantially delinquent.  
     Credit risk profiles of middle market loans were as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's syndicated loans were all performing and   one   remaining directly originated loan classified as held for sale was in default.  The Company recorded an additional unrealized loss on this loan of   $9.6 million  , included in the net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on sales of investment securities available-for-sale and loans and derivatives line item on the consolidated statement of operations, representing the lower of the loan's cost or fair value based on an updated third party valuation at   September 30, 2016  .  The rest of the Company's portfolio is current with respect to debt service.  All of the Company s middle market loans were current with respect to debt service as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Residential Mortgage Loans 
  Residential mortgage loans are reviewed periodically for collectability in light of historical experience, the nature and amount of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing underlying conditions. 
  Direct Financing Leases 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a provision against the value of the direct financing leases in the amount of   $465,000  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   $571,000   of direct financing leases, net of reserves.

NOTE 11 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS       
  The following table summarizes the activity of intangible assets for the period indicated (in thousands): 

Management Contracts and Wholesale/Correspondent Relationships 
  The Company recognized fee income on management contracts of   $553,000   and   $1.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $791,000   and   $2.7 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   the Company recorded amortization expense of   $331,000   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, related to the Company's management contracts.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   the Company recorded amortization expense of   $518,000   and   $1.5 million   related to the Company's management contracts and wholesale/correspondent relationships, respectively.   In October 2016,   one   of the two remaining CLOs associated with the management contracts was called, and the anticipated call date of the other CLO was determined to be early 2017.  In accordance with guidance on intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company tested its   two   remaining management contracts for impairment at   September 30, 2016  .  The carrying amounts of the management contracts were deemed to be unrecoverable and in excess of their fair values, calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis.  As a result, an impairment loss of   $3.7 million   was recognized for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and recorded on the Company s consolidated statement of operations.  The Company expects to record amortization expense on its management contracts of   $299,000   for the three months ending   December 31, 2016  . The Company expects to record amortization expense on its management contracts of   $213,000   for the year ending December 31,   2017  , and   no   amortization expense of its management contracts in 2018, 2019 or 2020. The weighted average amortization period was   0.7   years and   5.8   years at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Mortgage Servicing Rights  
  Through the Company's wholly-owned residential mortgage loan originator PCM, residential mortgage loans are sold through one of the following methods: (i) sales to or pursuant to programs sponsored by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Government National Mortgage Association, or (ii) sales to private investors. The Company may have continuing involvement in mortgage loans sold by retaining servicing rights and servicing obligations. 
  The total servicing portfolio consists of loans associated with capitalized mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) and loans held for sale.  In accordance with guidance on servicing assets and liabilities, the Company utilizes the amortization method for the subsequent measurement of its MSRs. The total servicing portfolio was   $3.0 billion   and   $2.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  MSRs recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets are related to the capitalized servicing portfolio and are created through the sale of originated residential mortgage loans.  Amounts related to capitalized MSRs are recorded in the gain (loss) on sale of residential mortgage loans line item in the Company's statement of operations.  Amounts related to temporary impairment adjustments are recorded in fee income in the Company's statement of operations. 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   $1.5 million   and   $3.8 million   of amortization expense related to MSRs, respectively.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized   $1.3 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively.  The Company expects to recognize amortization related to its MSRs

portfolio in the amount of $  1.6 million   for the three months ending   December 31, 2016  ,   $5.5 million   for the year ending December 31, 2017,   $4.4 million   for the year ending December 31, 2018,   $3.5 million   for the year ending December 31, 2019, and   $2.9 million   for the year ending December 31, 2020.  The weighted average amortization period was   5.1   years and   6.7   years at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The Company also records MSRs at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  MSRs are recorded at fair value at inception and at the end of each reporting period if the fair value is less than unamortized cost. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of MSRs utilizing the valuation services of an independent third party. The key assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of MSRs include prepayment speeds, discount rates, default rates, cost to service, contractual servicing fees and escrow earnings. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   the Company recorded temporary impairment of   $800,000   increasing the impairment for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to   $5.6 million  . The fair value of MSRs was   $25.3 million   and   $21.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The activity in the loan servicing portfolio associated with capitalized servicing rights consisted of the following (in thousands): 

The value of MSRs is driven by the net positive, or in some cases net negative, cash flows associated with servicing activities.  These cash flows include contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and other ancillary servicing revenue and were recorded within fee income as follows (in thousands):

  The following table summarizes restricted common stock grants during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    In connection with a grant of restricted common stock made on   September 24, 2014  , the Company agreed to issue up to   17,682   shares of common stock if certain loan origination performance thresholds were achieved by personnel from the Company s loan origination team.  The performance criteria were measured at the end of   two   annual measurement periods which began   April 1, 2014  .  The agreement also provided dividend equivalent rights pursuant to which the dividends that would have been paid on the shares had they been issued on the date of grant were paid at the end of each annual measurement period if the performance criteria were met.  If the performance criteria were not met, the accrued dividends would be forfeited.  As a consequence, the Company did not record the dividend equivalent rights until earned.  On   March 31, 2016  , the final measurement period ended and   8,840   shares were earned.  Approximately   $42,000   of accrued dividend equivalent rights were paid in April 2016.

NOTE 17 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    
  Relationship with Resource America and Certain of its Subsidiaries 
  Relationship with Resource America.    On September 19, 2013, the audit committee of the board of directors of Resource America concluded that Resource America should consolidate the financial statements of the Company, which was previously treated as an unconsolidated VIE.  Resource America's audit committee reached this conclusion after consultations with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ) following comments received from the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance of the Commission and the audit committee's discussion with the Company's management and its independent registered public accounting firm.  Resource America's audit committee noted that consolidation of the Company was not expected to materially affect Resource America's previously reported net income attributable to common shareholders.  In December 2015, Resource America elected to early adopt consolidation guidance issued by the FASB in February 2015 (see Note 2) and as a result was required to reevaluate whether or not the Company should be consolidated into Resource America s financial statements.  It was determined that the Company is no longer a VIE and Resource America will no longer consolidate the Company s financial statements.  On September 8, 2016, Resource America was acquired by C-III, a leading commercial real estate services company engaged in a broad range of activities, including primary and special loan servicing, loan origination, fund management, CDO management, principal investment, investment sales and multifamily property management.  As part of the transaction, C-III took over control of the Company's Manager with respect to the management agreement (described below) from Resource America and became beneficial owner of   715,396   shares of the Company's common equity (  2.3%   of the Company's outstanding shares) held by Resource America as of   September 30, 2016  .  On May 22, 2016, Resource America entered into a letter agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Company irrevocably waived its right to terminate the management agreement as a result of a  Change of Control  (as defined in the management agreement) resulting from the merger.  At the close of the transaction on September 8, 2016, Resource America paid a   $1.5 million   fee to the Company for the waiver which was recorded in other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. 
  The Company is managed by the Manager, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Resource America, pursuant to a management agreement that provides for both base and incentive management fees.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   the Manager earned base management fees of approximately   $2.9 million   and   $9.8 million  , respectively.  For

the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Manager earned base management fees of approximately   $3.1 million   and   $9.8 million  , respectively.     No   incentive management fees were earned for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .  The Company also reimburses the Manager and Resource America for expenses, including the expenses of employees of Resource America who perform legal, accounting, due diligence and other services that outside professionals or consultants would otherwise perform, and for the wages, salaries and benefits of several Resource America personnel dedicated to the Company s operations.  The Company also reimburses Resource America for additional costs incurred related to the Company's life care business, Long Term Care Conversion Funding, established for the purpose of originating and acquiring life settlement contracts.  The initial agreement, authorized in December 2012, provided for an annual fee of   $550,000  , with a   two  -year term.  In March 2015, the agreement was amended to extend the term for an additional   two   years terminating in December 2016.  This fee is paid quarterly.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   the Company paid the Manager   $1.4 million   and   $4.0 million  , respectively, as expense reimbursements.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   the Company paid the Manager   $1.3 million   and   $4.0 million  , respectively, as expense reimbursements.       
  On November 24, 2010, the Company entered into an Investment Management Agreement with Resource Capital Markets, Inc. ( RCM ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Resource America.  The initial agreement provided that: (a) RCM may invest up to   $5.0 million   of the Company s funds, with the investable amount being adjusted by portfolio gains (losses) and collections, and offset by expenses, taxes and realized management fees, and (b) RCM can earn a management fee in any year that the net profits earned exceed a preferred return.  On June 17, 2011, the Company entered into a revised Investment Management Agreement with RCM which provided an additional   $8.0 million   of the Company s funds.  The management fee is   20%   of the amount by which the net profits exceed the preferred return.  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , RCM earned   no   management fees.  The portfolio began a partial liquidation during the year ended December 31, 2013 that has resulted in the outstanding portfolio balance being significantly decreased.  The Company holds   $3.7 million   in fair market value of trading securities as of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   change from   $3.7 million   at fair market value as of   December 31, 2015  .  The Company also reimburses RCM for expenses paid on the Company's behalf.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company paid RCM   $1,000   and   $9,000  , respectively, as expense reimbursements.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   the Company paid RCM   $21,000   and   $118,000  , respectively, as expense reimbursements.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was indebted to the Manager for   $1.5 million  , comprised of base management fees of   $948,000   and expense reimbursements of   $600,000  .

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was indebted to RCM under the Company s Investment Management Agreement for   $77,000  , comprised entirely of expense reimbursements.  At   December 31, 2015  , the Company was indebted to RCM under the Company s Investment Management Agreement for   $152,000  , comprised entirely of expense reimbursements.  The Company's base management fee payable as well as expense reimbursements payable are recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company, through one of its subsidiaries, Northport TRS, LLC, began originating middle-market loans.  Resource America was paid origination fees in connection with the Company s middle-market lending operations, which capped out at   2%   of the loan balance for any loan originated.  The Company was indebted to RCM for   $0   and   $93,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for the middle-market operations.  As a result of its sale of Northport TRS, LLC, the Company has sold substantially all of its direct origination middle market loans and   one   syndicated loan, with an aggregate par balance of   $257.3 million  . 
  On November 7, 2013, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased all of the membership interests in Elevation Home Loans, LLC, a start-up residential mortgage company, from a person who subsequently became an employee of Resource America for   $830,000  , paid in the form of   34,165   shares of restricted Company common stock.  The restricted stock vests in full on November 7, 2016, and includes dividend equivalent rights.  Elevation Home Loans, LLC was liquidated in 2016.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company retained equity in   eight   securitizations, which were structured for the Company by the Manager.  Under the Management Agreement, the Manager was not separately compensated by the Company for executing these transactions and is not separately compensated for managing the securitizations' entities and their assets.  The Company has liquidated   two   of these securitizations,   one   in October 2014 and another in June 2015.  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted new consolidation guidance on variable interest entities and, as a result,   two   of the Company's remaining securitizations were deconsolidated. 
  Relationship with LEAF Commercial Capital.     LCC originated and managed equipment leases and notes on behalf of the Company.  On March 5, 2010, the Company entered into agreements with Lease Equity Appreciation Fund II, L.P. ( LEAF II ) (an equipment leasing partnership sponsored by LEAF Financial and of which a LEAF Financial subsidiary is the general partner), pursuant to which the Company provided and funded an   $8.0 million   credit facility to LEAF II.  The credit facility initially had a   one year   term with interest at   12%   per year, payable quarterly, and was secured by all the assets of LEAF II, including its entire ownership interest in LEAF II Receivables Funding.  The Company received a   1%   origination fee in connection with establishing the facility.  The facility originally matured on March 3, 2011 and was extended until September 3, 2011 with a   1%   extension fee paid on the outstanding loan balance.  On June 3, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to extend the maturity to February 15, 2012 and to decrease the interest rate from   12%   to   10%   per annum resulting in a troubled-debt restructuring under current accounting guidance.  On February 15, 2012, the credit facility was further amended to extend the maturity to February 15, 2013 with a   1%   extension fee accrued and added to the amount outstanding.  On January 11, 2013, the Company entered into another amendment to extend the maturity to February 15, 2014 with an additional   1%   extension fee accrued and added to the amount outstanding.  On December 17, 2013, the Company entered into another amendment to extend the maturity to February 15, 2015.  At the end of 2014, the Company recorded a provision for loan loss on this loan of   $1.3 million   before extinguishing the loan and bringing direct financing leases in the amount of   $2.1 million   on the Company's books in lieu of the loan receivable.

Also, on February 24, 2011, a subsidiary of the Company purchased   100%   of the ownership interests in Churchill Pacific Asset Management LLC ("CPAM") from Churchill Financial Holdings LLC for   $22.5 million  .  CPAM subsequently changed its name to RCAM.  Through RCAM, the Company was initially entitled to collect senior, subordinated and incentive fees related to   five   CLOs holding approximately   $1.9 billion   in assets managed by RCAM.  RCAM is assisted by CVC Credit Partners in managing these CLOs.  CVC Credit Partners is entitled to   10%   of all subordinated fees and   50%   of the incentive fees received by RCAM.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   CVC Credit Partners earned subordinated and incentive fees of   $254,000   and   $561,000  , respectively.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   CVC Credit Partners earned subordinated and incentive fees of   $173,000   and   $631,000  , respectively.

In May 2013, the Company purchased additional equity in this CLO, increasing its ownership percentage to   68.3%  .  In 2013   two   of the   five   CLOs were called and the notes were paid down in full.  In January 2016 another RCAM-managed CLO was called and   $2.4 million   of impairment, on a pre-tax basis, was recorded in depreciation and amortization on the Company's consolidated statements of operations on the related intangible asset as of December 31, 2015.  In September 2016, another RCAM-managed CLO was called and   $1.5 million   of impairment, on a pre-tax basis, was recorded in impairment losses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations on the related intangible asset during the three months ended September, 30 2016.  In September 2016, the Company recorded impairment on the remaining CLO of   $2.2 million  , on a pre-tax basis, on the related intangible asset for its anticipated redemption in early 2017.

RCP is the general partner of the RRE Opportunity Fund.  The loan was secured by RCP s partnership interest in the RRE Opportunity Fund.  The promissory note bore interest at a fixed rate of   8.0%   per annum on the unpaid principal balance.  In the event of default, interest accrued at a rate of   5.0%   in excess of the fixed rate.  Interest was payable quarterly.  Mandatory principal payments were required to the extent distributable cash or other proceeds from RRE Opportunity Fund represent a return of RCP s capital.  The loan had an original maturity date of January 14, 2015, with   two     one  -year extensions.  RCP exercised the first option, extending the maturity to January 14, 2016.

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   RCC Residential received a cash distribution in the amount of   $620,000  .  The Company's ownership interest was   28.6%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted new consolidation guidance on variable interest entities and, as a result, the Company deconsolidated RCM Global and now accounts for this investment as an investment in unconsolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheet (  see Note 2  ).  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded losses of   $560,000   and   $160,000   which was recorded in equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of operations, respectively.

Pelium Capital is a specialized credit opportunity fund managed by Resource America.  The Company funded its final commitment of   $2.5 million  , as of February 1, 2015.  The Company will receive   10%   of the carried interest in the partnership for the first   five   years, and can increase its interest to   20%   if the Company's capital contributions aggregate   $40.0 million  .  Resource America contributed securities valued at   $2.8 million   to the formation of Pelium Capital.  The portion of the fund that the Company does not own is presented as non-controlling interests as of the dates and for the periods presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements.  Pelium Capital was determined not to be a VIE as there was sufficient equity at risk, the Company does not have disproportionate voting rights and Pelium Capital's partners have all of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities of Pelium; (2) the obligation to absorb losses; and (3) the right to receive residual returns.  However, Pelium Capital was consolidated as a result of the Company's majority ownership and the Company's unilateral kick-out rights. The non-controlling interests in Pelium Capital are owned by Resource America and outside investors.  All intercompany accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation as of December 31, 2015.  The Company's ownership interest in Pelium Capital was   80.2%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted new consolidation guidance on variable interest entities and, as a result, the Company deconsolidated Pelium Capital and now accounts for this investment as an investment in unconsolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheet (  see Note 2  ).  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded earnings of   $1.0 million   and   $2.8 million   which was recorded in equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of operations, respectively.

The loan in the amount of   $2.5 million   was repaid in full with interest on April 29, 2015.  The second loan in the amount of   $3.3 million   was repaid in full with interest on July 31, 2015. 
    
  On June 24, 2015, the Company committed to invest up to   $50.0 million   in Pearlmark Mezz, a Delaware limited partnership.  The contractual fund manager of the fund is Pearlmark Real Estate LLC ("Pearlmark"), a Delaware limited liability company that is   50%   owned by Resource America.  The Company will pay Pearlmark Mezz management fees of   1.0%   on the unfunded committed capital and   1.5%   on the invested capital.  The Company is entitled to a management fee rebate of   25%   for the first year of the fund.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is indebted for   $268,000   for management fees, net of the rebate.  Resource America has agreed that it will credit any such fees paid by the Company to Pearlmark against the base management fee that the Company pays to Resource America.  The Company has invested an aggregate of   $17.8 million   in capital in Pearlmark Mezz.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded earnings of   $132,000   and   $552,000   which was recorded in equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of operations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has an investment balance of   $16.8 million   and a   47.7%   ownership interest in the fund. 
    
    Relationship with Law Firm  .  Until 1996, Edward E. Cohen, a former director who was the Company s Chairman from its inception until November 2009, was of counsel to Ledgewood, P.C. ("Ledgewood"), a law firm.  In addition, one of the Company s former executive officers, Jeffrey F. Brotman, was employed by Ledgewood until 2007.  Mr. E.

NOTE 18 - DISTRIBUTIONS    
    For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company declared and subsequently paid a dividend of   $0.42   per common share. 
  In order to qualify as a REIT, the Company must currently distribute at least   90%   of its taxable income.  In addition, the Company must distribute   100%   of its taxable income in order not to be subject to corporate federal income taxes on retained income.  The Company anticipates it will distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its stockholders.  Because taxable income differs from cash flow from operations due to non-cash revenues or expenses (such as provisions for loan and lease losses and depreciation), in certain circumstances, the Company may generate operating cash flow in excess of its distributions or, alternatively, may be required to borrow to make sufficient distribution payments. 
  The Company s   2016   dividends are determined by the Company s board of directors which also consider the composition of any dividends declared, including the option of paying a portion in cash and the balance in additional common shares.  
  The following tables present dividends declared (on a per share basis) for the first three quarters of 2016 and each of the quarters in 2015:

NOTE 19 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
  The following table presents information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value as follows (in thousands): 

The Company's residential mortgage loan portfolio included in loans held for sale is comprised of both agency loans and non-agency jumbo loans. The fair values of the Company's agency loan portfolio are generally classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as those values are determined based on quoted market prices for similar assets or upon other observable inputs. The fair values of the Company's jumbo loan portfolio are generally classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as those values are based upon the fair value of securities backed by similar mortgage loans, adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan including the value attributable to servicing rights and credit risk. Loans are adjusted for spread to agency mortgage back securities with similar underlying mortgage loans, at rates ranging between   0.5%   and   7.3%  .  
       
  The fair value of interest rate lock commitments ("IRLCs") is estimated as the fair value of the of the underlying mortgage loans to be sold, which is based on quoted mortgage-backed securities ("MBSs") prices, plus the estimated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights, less the price committed to the borrower or mortgage lender and direct origination costs, adjusted for the probability that the mortgage will fund ("pull-through" rate). The estimated pull-through rate is based on the Company's historical data.  IRLCs are included in derivatives on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
  The average pull-through rate used in measuring the fair value of IRLCs as of   September 30, 2016   was   83.6%   for assets and   90.5%   for liabilities.  The pull-through percentage is considered a significant unobservable input and is estimated based on changes in pricing and actual borrower behavior using a historical analysis of loan closing data. Generally, a change in interest rates is accompanied by a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for the pull-through percentage, and the impact to fair value of a change in pull-through would be partially offset by the related change in price.

Forwards - residential mortgage loans fix the forward sales price that will be realized upon the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary market. The fair value of forward delivery commitments is primarily based upon the current agency mortgage-backed security market to-be-announced pricing specific to the loan program, delivery coupon and delivery date of the trade. Best effort sales commitments are also executed for certain loans at the time the borrower commitment is made. These best effort sales commitments are valued using the committed price to the counterparty against the current market price of the interest rate lock commitment or mortgage loan held for sale.  Forwards are included in derivatives on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
    
     As part of the origination of a certain middle market loan, the Company received warrants as consideration at the loan's origination.  The fair value of the warrants at   December 31, 2015   was   $1.1 million   which was calculated by performing a Black-Scholes analysis.  The significant unobservable inputs were a measure of   50.0%   for the annual volatility over the term of the warrants and a market capitalization of   $172.7 million  . These warrants were settled in August 2016. 
    
  In accordance with guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures, the Company is not required to disclose quantitative information with respect to unobservable inputs contained in fair value measurements that are not developed by the Company. As a consequence, the Company has not disclosed such information associated with fair values obtained for investment securities, trading and investment securities available for sale from third-party pricing sources.  
       
  The following table presents additional information about assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis for which the Company has utilized Level 3 inputs (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Structured finance securities, loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments, and forwards on residential mortgage loans include   $86,000  ,   $(33,000)  ,   $0  , and   $0  , respectively, in earnings attributable to the change in unrealized gains or (losses) relating to assets still held at the reporting date for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

The following table presents additional information about liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis for which the Company has utilized Level 3 inputs (in thousands): 

The following table summarizes the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value as follows (in thousands):       

           (1) 
    See Note 11 for a description of the valuation techniques and key assumption types to the calculation of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. 
     Loans held for sale consist of middle market loans identified for sale.  The fair value of Level 2 middle market loans held for sale are based on quoted market prices for similar assets or upon other observable inputs. The fair value of Level 3 middle market loans held for sale may be determined using a market or income approach methodology, both of which may require significant judgment or estimation for factors such as EBITDA multiples, market capitalization rates or discount rates, depending on the methodology used. The following unobservable input was used in the determination of fair value with respect to Level 3 middle market loans at September 30, 2016: EBITDA multiples ranged from   3.5  x -   4.5  x. 
   Impaired loans consist of CRE loans for which an impairment analysis was conducted during the period. For the Company s CRE loans for which there is no primary market, fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow analysis, appraisal or and other valuation technique; and these loans are classified as nonrecurring Level 3.   
  For both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   there were   $8.1 million   of nonrecurring fair value losses for specifically impaired loans. The amounts of nonrecurring fair value losses for specifically impaired loans for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   $920,000   and   $42.4 million  , respectively.  The amounts of nonrecurring fair value losses for loans held for sale for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $9.6 million   and   $21.8 million  , respectively.  The amounts of nonrecurring fair value losses for loans held for sale for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   $35,000   and   $841,000  , respectively.  Fair value was determined using an appraisal as a practical expedient to fair value. 
  The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.  The fair values of the Company's short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, principal paydown receivable, interest receivable, distribution payable, accrued interest expense, repurchase agreements and the secured

revolving credit agreement approximate their carrying value on the consolidated balance sheets.  The fair values of the Company s investment securities, trading are reported in   Note 5  .  The fair values of the Company s investment securities available-for-sale are reported in   Note 6  .  The fair values of the Company s derivative instruments are reported in   Note 20  . 
  The fair value of the Company s Level 2 loans held-for-investment are primarily measured using a third-party pricing service.  The fair value of the Company s Level 3 loans held-for-investment are measured by discounting the expected future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. 
  CDO notes are valued using dealer quotes, typically the dealer who underwrote the CDO in which the notes are held.  
  Junior subordinated notes are estimated by discounted cash flows with discount rates of   13.14%   and   13.15%   and used in the evaluation of RCT I and RCT II. 
  The fair value of the convertible notes was determined using a discounted cash flow model that discounts the expected future cash flows using current interest rates on similar debts that do not have a conversion option. The   6.0%   Convertible Senior Notes are discounted at a rate of   7.00%   and the   8.0%   Convertible Senior Notes are discounted at a rate of   8.60%  .  The fair value of the CRE portfolio was determined using a discounted cash flow model that discounts the expected future cash flows at current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and with the same remaining maturities.  Discount rates used range between   15%-25%  .  
  Repurchase agreements and the senior secured revolving credit agreement are variable rate debt instruments indexed to LIBOR that reset periodically and, as a result, their carrying value approximates their fair value.   
  The fair values of the Company s remaining financial instruments that are not reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are reported in the following table (in thousands):

NOTE 20 - MARKET RISK AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS    
  The Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as "market risks." When deemed appropriate, the Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
  The Company may hold various derivatives in the ordinary course of business, including warrants, interest rate swaps, forward contracts, options and IRLCs.  Warrants are securities that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase securities from an issuer at a specific price and within a specified time period.  All warrants held by the Company had been settled as of   September 30, 2016  .  Options are contracts sold by one party to another that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a financial asset at an agreed-upon price during a certain period of time or on a specific date. Interest rate swap agreements are contracts between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. Forward contracts represent future commitments to either purchase or to deliver loans (residential mortgage lending), securities (TBA securities) or a quantity of a currency (foreign currency hedging) at a predetermined future date, at a predetermined rate or price and are used to manage interest rate risk on loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale as well as currency risk with respect to the Company's long positions in foreign currency-denominated investment securities.  Rate lock commitments represent commitments to fund loans at a specific rate and by a specified time and are used to mitigate risk of changes in interest rate in the Company's residential mortgage loan portfolio.   
  A significant market risk to the Company is interest rate risk.  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the Company s control.  Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with the interest-bearing liabilities, by affecting the spread between the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of the Company s interest-earning assets and the Company s ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets.  A decline in the value of the Company s interest-earning assets pledged as collateral for borrowings could result in the counterparties demanding additional collateral pledges or liquidation of some of the existing collateral to reduce borrowing levels. 
   The Company seeks to manage the extent to which net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable-rate assets with variable-rate borrowings.  The Company seeks to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in its investment portfolio by entering into interest rate hedging agreements such as interest rate caps and interest rate swaps. 
  On January 1, 2016, RREF CDO 2006-1 and RREF CDO 2007-1 were deconsolidated in accordance with new guidance on consolidation of VIEs (  see Note 2  ). The Company deconsolidated   six   interest rate swap contracts as part of the deconsolidation.   The aggregate notional amount of these deconsolidated interest rate swaps was   $99.9 million   at January 1, 2016. 
  During April 2016, the Company requested and canceled its remaining interest rate swap contract through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), to be amortized through earnings over the life of the remaining debt.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no interest rate swap contracts outstanding.  The Company had master netting agreements with Credit Suisse International and Wells Fargo at   September 30, 2016  .  Regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act mandate that the Company clear certain new interest rate swap transactions through a central counterparty. Transactions that are centrally cleared result in the Company facing a clearing house, rather than a swap dealer, as counterparty.  Central clearing requires the Company to post collateral in the form of initial and variation margin to satisfy potential future obligations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no centrally cleared interest rate swap contracts. The Company classifies its hedges as cash flow hedges, which are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes in the cash flows of a financial asset or liability.  The Company records changes in fair value of derivatives designated and effective as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income, and records changes in fair value of derivatives designated and ineffective as cash flow hedges in earnings. 
   At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   nine   interest rate swap contracts outstanding whereby the Company paid an average fixed rate of   5.38%   and received a variable rate equal to   one-month LIBOR  .  The aggregate notional amount of these contracts was   $102.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The counterparties for the Company s designated interest rate hedge contracts are Credit Suisse International and Wells Fargo with which the Company has master netting agreements.

The estimated fair value of the Company s liability related to interest rate swaps was   $0   and   $3.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company had aggregate unrealized losses of   $41,000   and   $3.5 million   on the interest rate swap agreements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and a portion is recognized through earnings.  The amortization is reflected in interest expense in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
  The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, a form of risk that arises from the change in price of one currency against another. Substantially all of the Company's revenues are transacted in U.S. dollars; however, a significant amount of the Company's capital is exposed to other currencies, primarily the Euro and, to a lesser extent, the pound sterling. To address this market risk, the Company generally hedges foreign currency-denominated exposures (typically investments in debt instruments, including forecasted principal and interest payments) with foreign currency forward contracts. The Company classifies these hedges as fair value hedges, which are hedges that mitigate the risk of changes in the fair values of assets, liabilities, and certain types of firm commitments.  The Company records changes in fair value of derivatives designated and effective as fair value hedges in earnings offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items. 
  Forward contracts also contain an element of risk in that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of such agreements.  In the event the parties to deliver commitments are unable to fulfill their obligations, the Company could potentially incur significant additional costs by replacing the positions at then current market rates.  The Company manages its risk of exposure by limiting counterparties to those banks and institutions deemed appropriate by management.  The Company does not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations and, therefore, the Company does not expect to incur any cost related to counterparty default.  
  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on loans held for sale and IRLCs.  As market interest rates increase or decrease, the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and IRLCs will decline or increase accordingly.  To offset this interest rate risk, the Company may enter into derivatives such as forward contracts to sell loans.  The fair value of these forward sales contracts will change as market interest rates change, and the change in the value of these instruments is expected to largely, though not entirely, offset the change in fair value of loans held for sale and IRLCs.  The objective of this activity is to minimize the exposure to losses on IRLCs and loans held for sale due to market interest rate fluctuations.  The net effect of derivatives on earnings will depend on risk management activities and a variety of other factors, including market interest rate volatility, the amount of IRLCs that close, the ability to fill the forward contracts before expiration, and the time period required to close and sell loans.  
  During the warehousing phase of the Company s investments in certain structured vehicles, the Company may enter into total return swaps to finance the Company s exposure to assets that will ultimately be securitized.  A total return swap is a swap agreement in which one party makes payments based on a set rate, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset.  Traditionally, the Company pays either an indexed or fixed interest payment to the warehousing lender and receives the net interest income and realized capital gains of the referenced portfolio of assets, generally loans, to be securitized that are owned and held by the warehousing lender.  Upon the close of the warehousing period, the Company s invested equity plus net interest and any capital gains realized during the warehousing period are returned to the Company.  Additionally, upon the close of the securitization, the Company may purchase beneficial interests in the securitization at fair value.

       In the Company's consolidated balance sheets, all balances associated with repurchase agreement and derivatives transactions are presented on a gross basis.

NOTE 22 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
  From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation on various matters, including disputes arising out of loans in the Company's portfolio and agreements to purchase or sell assets. Given the nature of the Company's business activities, the Company considers these matters to be routine and in the ordinary conduct of its business. The resolution of these matters may result in adverse judgments, fines, penalties, injunctions and other relief against the Company as well as monetary payments or other agreements and obligations. Alternately, the Company may engage in settlement discussions on certain matters in order to avoid the additional costs of engaging in litigation. 
  In September 2015, Daren Levin filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons who purchased the Company's common stock between March 2, 2015 and August 4, 2015.  In November 2015, the Court appointed Douglas Drees as the lead plaintiff in the action, and thereafter entered a stipulation and order directing the lead plaintiff to file an amended complaint.  In February 2016, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint, alleging that the Company and certain of its officers and directors materially misrepresented certain risks of its commercial loan portfolio and its processes and controls for assessing the quality of its portfolio.  Based on these allegations, the amended complaint asserts claims for violation of the securities laws and seeks a variety of relief, including unspecified monetary damages as well as costs and attorneys  fees.  In April 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which the court denied on October 5, 2016; and the discovery process is now expected to commence.  The Company believes the amended complaint is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously 
                  In December 2015, Josh Reaves filed a shareholder derivative suit in the Supreme Court of New York alleging that the Company's directors and certain officers breached their fiduciary duties by causing the Company to misrepresent certain risks in its commercial loan portfolio, by failing to employ adequate internal and financial controls and by failing to disclose the alleged internal control deficiencies.  The complaint purports to seek relief on behalf of the Company for unspecified damages as well as costs and attorneys  fees.  The Company believes that the plaintiff, who failed to make a pre-suit demand on the board of directors, lacks standing to assert claims derivatively on the Company's behalf.  In April 2016, the parties entered into a stipulation staying this proceeding until such time as the court ruled on the motion to dismiss the Levin action referenced above or certain other triggering events occur.  That stay has now been lifted because the motion to dismiss the Levin action was denied. 
    
  PCM is a party to various claims and legal proceedings at various times. If PCM believes that a loss arising from any of these matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, the loss is recorded. Currently, the only litigation involving PCM is related to claims for repurchases or indemnifications on loans that PCM has sold to investors.  Such claims are included in the reserve for mortgage repurchases and indemnifications. The reserve for mortgage repurchases and indemnifications was   $5.2 million   and   $3.7 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  Loans on one-to-four family residential mortgages originated by PCM are sold to various financial institutions and governmental entities with representations and warranties that are usual and customary for the industry. In the event of a breach of any of the representations and warranties related to a loan sold, PCM may be required to indemnify the investor against future losses, repurchase the mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for actual losses incurred (referred to as  make whole payments ).  The maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of an indemnification or loan repurchase would be the unpaid principal balance of the loan along with any premium paid by the investor when the loan was purchased, accrued but unpaid interest and other minor cost reimbursements.  This maximum exposure is at least partially mitigated by the value of the collateral underlying the mortgage loan.

On May 13, 2014, ResCap Liquidating Trust ( ResCap ), as successor to Residential Funding Company, LLC ( RFC ), filed an adversary proceeding against PCM in United States Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York.  ResCap has sued some   90   sellers of residential mortgage loans for alleged breaches of warranty in various loans sold to RFC.  RFC contends that such breaches caused it damages from loan losses and liability to other transferee's of the loans.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , outstanding demands for indemnification, repurchase or make whole payments totaled approximately   $20.5 million  , of which a substantial portion related to loans sold to   four   investors prior to 2011.  In October 2016, PCM reached agreements to settle repurchase claims with   two   of the   four   investors, including those subject to the litigation initiated by ResCap in May 2014.  Pursuant to the settlement agreements,   $2.1 million   was fully reserved for at September 30, 2016.  These settlement agreements reduce the amount of outstanding demands against PCM for indemnification, repurchase or make whole payments to approximately   $10.0 million  . 
  The most significant remaining make whole demands against PCM are from Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc. ( LBHI ). On February 3, 2016, LBHI filed an adversary proceeding against PCM in United States Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York.  LBHI has sued approximately   145   sellers of residential mortgage loans for alleged breaches of warranty in various loans sold to it.  LBHI contends that such breaches caused it damages from loan losses and liability to other transferees of the loans.  PCM intends to defend the action vigorously. 
  Unfunded commitments on the Company s originated CRE loans generally fall into   two   categories: (1) pre-approved capital improvement projects; and (2) new or additional construction costs subject, in each case, to the borrower meeting specified criteria.  Upon completion of the improvements or construction, the Company would receive additional interest income on the advanced amount. Unfunded commitments on the Company's originated middle market loans fall into two categories: (1) revolving credit facility; and (2) unfunded commitments subject to the borrower meeting pre-specified criteria.  
  Except as previously discussed, the Company is unaware of any contingencies arising from such routine litigation that would require accrual or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016  .  

NOTE 23 - SEGMENT REPORTING    
    
  The Company has   five   reportable operating segments: Commercial Real Estate Lending, Commercial Finance, Middle Market Lending, Residential Mortgage Lending, and Corporate   Other. The reportable operating segments are business units that offer different products and services. The Commercial Real Estate Lending operating segment includes the Company s activities and operations related to commercial real estate loans, commercial real estate-related securities, and investments in real estate. The Commercial Finance operating segment includes the Company s activities and operations related to bank loans, bank loan-related securities, and direct financing leases. The Middle Market Lending operating segment includes the Company s activities and operations related to the origination and purchase of middle market loans. The Residential Mortgage Lending operating segment includes the Company s activities and operations related to the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans and the investment in RMBS.  The Corporate   Other segment includes corporate level interest income, interest expense, and general and administrative expense.  
    
  The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in   Note 2  .  The Company accounts for inter-segment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices. Relevant expenses incurred at the Corporate   Other segment are allocated to TRS subsidiaries based on their percentage of adjusted pre-tax net income (loss), which excludes unrealized gains and losses and provisions on loan and lease losses that are specific to the periods presented.

  NOTE 24 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    
  The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this report and determined that there have not been any events that have occurred that would require adjustments to or disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, except the following:  
  Subsequent to quarter end, the Company's board of directors approved the framework of a plan to streamline the Company's operations by focusing on CRE lending and exiting underperforming non-CRE businesses and investments.  As part of this plan, the Company expects to discontinue operations in its middle market lending segment, its residential mortgage lending segment, and other non-real estate related portfolios.  In addition, the Company intends to sell several of its legacy CRE loans and classify them as loans, held for sale as of December 31, 2016.

  We are a commercial mortgage real estate investment trust ("REIT") focused on originating, holding and managing commercial real estate ("CRE") debt investments.  We also have made commercial finance investments.  We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Our objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, including quarterly distributions and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategies.  We invest in a combination of real estate debt investments and have invested, to a lesser extent, in higher-yielding commercial finance assets.  We have financed a substantial portion of our portfolio investments through borrowing strategies seeking to match the maturities and repricing dates of our financings with the maturities and repricing dates of those investments, and have sought to mitigate interest rate risk through derivative instruments.  
  We are externally managed by Resource Capital Manager, Inc., or the Manager, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Resource America, Inc., (formerly traded on NASDAQ: REXI) or Resource America, a specialized asset management company that uses industry-specific expertise to evaluate, originate, service and manage investment opportunities through its CRE, financial fund management and commercial finance operating segments.  On September 8, 2016, Resource America was acquired by C-III Capital Partners LLC ("C-III"), a leading CRE services company engaged in a broad range of activities, including primary and special loan servicing, loan origination, fund management, CDO management, principal investment, investment sales and multifamily property management.  As part of the transaction, C-III took over control of the manager and became the beneficial owner of 715,396 shares of our common equity (2.3% of our outstanding shares) held by Resource America. As part of the acquisition of Resource America by C-III, we were paid a $1.5 million consent fee by Resource America for having waived our right to terminate the Management Agreement as a result of the change of control of our Manager. The Manager now draws upon C-III and Resource America s management teams and their collective investment experience to provide its services. C-III has received approval from our board of directors to execute a strategic plan (the "Plan") to focus our strategy  on CRE debt investments.  The Plan contemplates disposing of certain legacy CRE debt instruments, exiting underperforming non-CRE businesses and investments, and establishing a dividend policy based on sustainable earnings.  We expect to implement the Plan over the next 12 to 18 months.      
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a net loss of $51.6 million, as our credit review process resulted in several significant write-downs and adjustments during the period. We recorded additional provisions for loan losses of $8.1 million on two legacy real estate loans.  A middle market loan held for sale, which was previously credit impaired, required a $9.6 million loss to recognize adjusted fair value. Securities available-for-sale had other-than-temporary impairments of $25.3 million. Most of these impairments came from our legacy real estate portfolio, specifically in the RREF CDP 2007-01 securitization as the underlying collateral suffered impairments during the period. Upon making the decision to dispose of the non-CRE businesses, which are typically done through taxable REIT subsidiaries, we re-evaluated our net deferred tax asset, which resulted in a net write-down of $12.3 million. In addition to the shift away from non-CRE businesses, we plan to dispose of our legacy real estate loans, and will move those loans to hold for sale status in the fourth quarter.  
  We began the process of disposing of several ancillary businesses as part of the Plan during the fourth quarter of 2016. The anticipated dispositions include our residential mortgage origination segment acquired in late 2013, and the balance of our middle market lending segment, which currently holds syndicated bank loans and a middle market direct origination loan that is currently classified as loans held for sale.  We expect to move these segments to discontinued operations and also to move our life

settlement contract investment as well as several legacy real estate loans to a held for sale classification in the fourth quarter of 2016.  As part of this reclassification, we estimate impairments of $11.0 million to $14.0 million to fair value the assets and liabilities of these held for sale investments during the fourth quarter.  
  In August 2016, we sold our interest in Northport TRS, LLC our self-originated middle market lending business. We had also experienced a reduction in our other commercial finance assets that began to liquidate in 2014 and we saw this trend continue through 2015 into 2016. We expect to liquidate our last bank loan CLO, Apidos Cinco in November 2016.  
  During the latter half of 2015 our common shares began to trade at prices well below our book value per share. We had previously sought to enhance shareholder value by instituting, on August 4, 2015, a $50.0 million securities repurchase program. Through September 30, 2016, we repurchased approximately $38.3 million of our common and preferred shares.  However, in September 2016, we stopped buying shares and instead began to marshal resources as part of our strategy to transform our operations into a real estate focused enterprise.  
  We generate our income primarily from the spread between the revenues we receive from our assets and the cost to finance the purchase of those assets, from management of assets and from hedging interest rate risks.  Historically, we have generated revenues from the interest and fees we ve earned on our whole loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, middle market loans, other asset-backed securities, or ABS, and structured note investments.  We also generated revenues from fees we ve received for the management of externally originated bank loans, from our residential mortgage origination business and from our investment in an equipment leasing business.  Given the new business strategy of focusing on commercial real estate activities, we expect to shift away from these ancillary businesses as we dispose of those investments and re-deploy the proceeds into commercial real estate activities.  
  Historically, we have used a substantial amount of leverage to enhance our returns and we have financed each of our different asset classes with different degrees of leverage.  The cost of borrowings to finance our investments is a significant part of our expenses.  Our net income depends on our ability to control these expenses relative to our revenue.    As it relates to  our commercial real estate loan portfolio, we historically have used repurchase agreements as a short-term financing source, and CDOs and, to a lesser extent, other term financing as long-term financing sources and expect to continue to use these financing sources into the near term future.           
  The current state of moderate growth in the United States economy has allowed us to make new investments, particularly in our primary business of commercial real estate lending.  During 2015 and through September 30, 2016, we have underwritten 47 new commercial real estate, or CRE, loans for a total of $914.4 million.  These loans were initially financed in part through our CRE term facilities and then financed longer-term through CRE securitizations.   As a result of the planned dispositions coupled with available debt financing of over $390.0 million, we intend to begin to grow our commercial real estate lending program, which will allow us to maintain a market presence and working relationships with our commercial real estate borrowers. 
  As of September 30, 2016, and as we move toward a real estate centric business, we had allocated our invested equity capital among our targeted asset classes as follows:   73%   in CRE assets,   17%   in commercial finance assets,   7%   in the residential mortgage lending business and   3%   in other investments.  As of December 31, 2015, we had allocated our invested equity capital as follows:   62%   in CRE assets,   28%   in commercial finance assets,   6%   in the residential mortgage lending business and   4%   in other assets.  
   
  Results of Operations    
  Our net loss allocable to common shares for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $51.6 million   or   $(1.69)   per share-basic (  $(1.69)   per share-diluted) and   $43.4 million   or   $(1.42)   per share-basic (  $(1.42)   per share-diluted) respectively, as compared to net income allocable to common shares of   $6.8 million  , or   $0.21   per share-basic (  $0.21   per share-diluted) and  a net loss of   $14.8 million   or   $(0.45)   per share-basic (  $(0.45)   per share-diluted) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   respectively.

Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Aggregate interest income   decreased     $7.0 million   and   $3.0 million   to   $31.4 million   and   $107.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $38.3 million   and   $110.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  We attribute these changes to the following:  
  Interest Income from Loans   
  Commercial real estate loans.    Interest income on CRE loans   decreased     $655,000   and increased   $2.3 million   to   $21.8 million   and   $64.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The   decrease   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   is primarily due to the deconsolidation of our CRE loans at RREF 2006-1 and RREF 2007-1. The increase for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is attributable to the origination of loans in our most recent CRE securitization, RCC 2015- CRE 4, which closed in August 2015.  
  Middle market loans.    On August 4, 2016, we sold Northport TRS, LLC, selling substantially all of our direct middle market loans and one syndicated loan with a combined par balance of $257.3 million.   This reduced the weighted average balance to   $168.4 million   and   $285.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to a weighted average balance of   $338.3 million   and   $300.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The weighted average yield on investments   increased   from   9.55%   and   9.68%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   9.85%   and   11.34%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which was primarily driven by   $2.6 million   of prepayment fees earned during for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Bank loans.   The weighted average loan balance on our bank loan portfolio   decreased   by   $164.2 million   and   $248.5 million   for   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to the liquidation of Apidos CDO III, Ltd. ( Apidos CDO III ) in June 2015 and the deconsolidation of Apidos Cinco CDO as of January 1, 2016, which is now recorded in interest income from securities. 
  Interest Income from Securities    
  Asset-Backed Securities, or ABS.    Interest income from ABS   increased     $1.9 million   and   $4.3 million   to   $3.5 million   and   $10.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The   increase   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is primarily attributable to the deconsolidation of RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1, and Apidos Cinco CDO on January 1, 2016.  As a result of the deconsolidation, the interest income derived from ABS is now reported as interest income from available-for-sale securities as compared to loan interest income in the prior year.  The deconsolidation significantly contributed to the   increase   in the weighted average balance of ABS from   $48.3 million   to   $140.5 million   and from   $51.3 million   to   $154.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The   decrease   in weighted average yield from   14.07%   to   9.77%   and from   15.74%   to   8.84%   directly relates to the deconsolidation of RCM Global and Pelium Capital whose income is now reported under earnings in unconsolidated entities.  
  Interest income - other.    Interest income - other   decreased     $199,000   and increased   $1.4 million   to   $769,000   and   $4.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $968,000   and   $2.9 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is related to the warehouse period ending on our investment in ZWH4, LLC ("ZAIS") in May 2016. We earned $450,000 of income on this investment in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $138,000 in other interest income.  The increase for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   is attributable to our investment in Harvest XV, in which $2.1 million in income was earned. This was partially offset by a decrease in $760,000 of income due to the sale of Harvest X in September 2015.

Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Aggregate interest expense   decreased     $2.2 million   and increased   $1.2 million   to   $14.1 million   and   $46.6 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   respectively as compared to   $16.3 million   and   $45.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  We attribute the changes to the following:  
  Commercial real estate loans.    Interest expense on commercial real estate loans   increased     $876,000   and   $5.6 million   to   $8.1 million   and   $23.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The   increase   was related to the increased borrowings from the consolidation of our securitization, RCC 2015-CRE4, which closed in August 2015 and, to a lesser extent, our securitization, RCC 2015-CRE3, that closed in February 2015. Current year interest expense also included a new financing facility to fund the production of new loans that was not included in the same period last year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the deconsolidation of RREF CDO 2006-1 and RREF CDO 2007-1. 
  Middle market loans.   Interest expense on middle market loans   decreased     $1.0 million   and   increased     $2.5 million   to   $467,000   and   $6.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $1.5 million   and   $3.7 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. On August 4, 2016, we sold Northport TRS, LLC.  As a result of the transaction,   $2.6 million   of amortization of the remaining deferred debt issuance costs related to the credit facility were accelerated and recorded as interest expense as of June 30, 2016.  
  Hedging Instruments.    Interest expense on hedging instruments   decreased     $1.7 million   and   $4.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The   decrease   is related to the deconsolidation of six hedge contracts in accordance with the deconsolidation of RREF CDO 2006-1 and RREF CDO 2007-1 on January 1, 2016 and maturity of two hedge contracts during the first quarter of 2016. 
  Bank loans.   Interest expense on bank loans   decreased     $452,000   and   $2.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The   decrease   is due to the deconsolidation of our remaining CLO, Apidos Cinco CDO, and, to a lesser extent, the liquidation of Apidos CDO III, Ltd. ( Apidos CDO III ) in June 2015.

Revenue 
  The following table sets forth information relating to our non-interest revenue for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Gain (loss) on sale of residential mortgage loans.  Gain (loss) on sale of residential mortgage loans   increased     $2.9 million   and   $4.0 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  In October 2016, Primary Capital Mortgage, LLC ("PCM") reached an agreement to settle the litigation initiated by a third party in May 2014 related to the settlement of legacy repurchase claims.  In connection therewith, PCM recorded an additional $1.0 million of indemnifications during the three months ended September 30, 2016 to fully reserve the total settlement amount of $2.1 million as of September 30, 2016.  In addition, there was an increase in secondary marketing income, where mortgage loans and servicing rights are sold between mortgage originators and investors, on our residential loan portfolio year over year.   
  Fee income.    Fee income   increased     $1.2 million   and   decreased     $3.3 million   to   $2.0 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  These changes relate to recording a temporary impairment against income on our mortgage servicing rights portfolio of $800,000 and $5.6 million and its corresponding amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to impairment on our mortgage servicing rights portfolio of $900,000 and $650,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  A discounted cash flow approach is used to estimate the fair value of MSRs utilizing the valuation services of an independent third party. The key assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of MSRs include prepayment speeds, discount rates, default rates, cost to service, contractual servicing fees and escrow earnings.  In addition, there was a decrease in income resulting from the run-off of managed assets related to our investment in Resource Capital Asset Management, or RCAM, which holds management contracts that entitle us to collect senior, subordinated, and incentive fees related to RCAM's remaining CLO issuers that it manages.

Operating Expenses 
  The following table sets forth information relating to our operating expenses incurred for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    Management fees   related party.   Management fees-related party   decreased     $199,000   and   $123,000   to   $3.1 million   and   $10.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively as compared to   $3.3 million   and   $10.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  This expense represents compensation in the form of base management fees and incentive management fees pursuant to our management agreement as well as fees to the Manager of our structured note portfolio.  The changes are described below: 
             
    Base management fee is a monthly fee equal to 1/12th of the amount of our equity multiplied by 1.50%.  Under the management agreement, "equity" is equal to the net proceeds from any issuance of shares of capital stock less offering related costs, plus or minus our retained earnings (excluding non-cash equity compensation incurred in current or prior periods) less any amounts we have paid for stock repurchases.  The calculation is adjusted for one-time events due to changes in GAAP, as well as other non-cash charges upon approval of our independent directors.  The base management fee decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to decreased stockholders' equity, a component in the formula by which base management fees are calculated, primarily as a result of our repurchase of approximately   8.3%   of our outstanding shares as part of our $50.0 million repurchase plan and quarterly dividend distributions in excess of earnings.  
                
    Incentive management fees are based upon the excess of adjusted operating earnings, as defined in the management agreement, over a variable base rate.  There were no fees paid for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
                
    An oversight management fee is a quarterly fee paid to Resource America to reimburse it for additional costs incurred  
     
    (Back to Index)

     (Back to Index)  

related to our life care business, Long Term Care Conversion Funding, established for the purpose of acquiring life settlement contracts.  The initial agreement, authorized in December 2012, provided for an annual fee of $550,000, with a two year term.   In March 2015, the agreement was amended to extend the term for an additional two years terminating in December 2016.  The oversight management fee was approximately $138,000 and $412,000 for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and $139,000 and $411,000 for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Equity compensation - related party.    Equity compensation - related party   increased     $2.0 million   and   $2.9 million   to   $1.8 million   and   $4.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively as compared to income of   $225,000   and expense of   $1.6 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  These expenses relate to the amortization of annual grants of restricted common stock to our non-employee independent directors, and annual and discretionary grants of restricted stock to employees of Resource America who provide investment management services to us through our Manager as well as employees of our residential mortgage company subsidiary.  This increase was primarily attributable to additional amortization of equity compensation in the amount of $896,000 related to the acceleration of shares granted to terminated executives at the close of the C-III merger.  In addition, accelerated amortization of $555,000 of equity compensation expense was recorded at PCM in connection with an employment separation agreement during the first quarter of 2016.  In addition, there was an increase in our stock price at   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  , which directly impacts our quarterly measurement of compensation expense.  
  General and administrative expense.    General and administrative expense   increased     $2.1 million   and   $3.7 million   to   $12.3 million   and   $33.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $10.2 million   and   $29.6 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The following table presents the allocation of general and administrative expenses between Corporate and PCM: 

General and administrative expense - Corporate.    General and administrative expense - Corporate   increased     $379,000   and   decreased     $285,000   to   $4.4 million   and   $12.6 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $4.1 million    and   $12.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   in expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is primarily attributable to legal expenses of approximately $216,000 related to the C-III transaction.  The   decrease   in expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is related to the deconsolidation of RCM Global, Pelium, Apidos Cinco CDO, and RREF CDO 2006-1 and RREF CDO 2007-1.  Specific expenses are no longer recorded on an entity level basis for these entities.  Prior to deconsolidation, each of the three CDOs recorded an average of $50,000 of general and administrative expenses each quarter and Pelium recorded approximately $75,000 each quarter.  The decrease year over year was also related to a non-recurring expense of approximately $399,000 relating to a proposed restructuring which we determined not to pursue during the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The decreases for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were partially offset by legal expenses related to the closing of the Northport TRS, LLC sale transaction recorded during the second and third quarters of 2016.

General and administrative expense - PCM.    General and administrative expense - PCM   increased     $1.7 million   and   $4.0 million   to   $7.9 million   and   $20.7 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $6.2 million   and   $16.7 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The   increase   is attributable to an increase in compensation costs and consulting fees to support PCM's continued geographic expansion as well as an increase in loan processing fees related to a rise in loan volume. 
  Depreciation and amortization.    Depreciation and amortization   decreased     $123,000   and   $164,000   to   $505,000   and   $1.7 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   respectively, as compared to   $628,000   and   $1.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The   decrease   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an RCAM-managed CLO being called in January 2016 and, as a result, termination of amortization on the underlying intangible asset.     
  Net impairment losses recognized in earnings.    Net impairment losses recognized in earnings was   $25.3 million     for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This impairment is primarily related to other-than-temporary impairment recorded on our investment in RREF CDO 2007-1, which is now classified as investment securities available-for-sale.  Third-party appraisers were recently engaged to perform appraisals on six of the seven remaining, legacy commercial real estate loans, which are part of the asset pool of RREF CDO 2007-1. As a result of having the properties supporting the loans appraised, two of the commercial real estate loans in the vehicle were determined to have cost bases in excess of their updated cash flows, as a result of the updated appraisals, causing a collective impairment charge to the cash flows of the vehicle of   $20.7 million  .  In addition, impairment losses of   $3.7 million  , on a pre-tax basis, were recognized as a result of the reduction of the actual and expected revenue-earning useful lives of two RCAM managed CLOs: Shasta and San Gabriel.  The Shasta CLO was called on October 20, 2016 and the San Gabriel CLO is expected to be called in the next three quarters. 
  Provision for loan and lease losses.    Provision for loan and lease losses   increased     $6.6 million   and   decreased     $24.0 million   to   $7.7 million   and   $19.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $1.0 million   and   $43.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The following table summarizes the information relating to our provision for loan losses for the periods presented (in thousands): 

CRE loan portfolio provision -   The CRE loan portfolio provision   increased   by   $8.0 million   and   decreased   by   $30.0 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded specific provisions of   $6.1 million   and   $2.0 million  , against   two   loans with amortized costs of   $27.5 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively.  As part of our ongoing monitoring, we obtained appraisals on   six   commercial real estate loans from third party vendors.    Two   of the loans were appraised and deemed to be valued below their previously stated cost basis.  One loan, a hotel located in Studio City, CA, was previously under contract for sale that supported the value in excess of our loan amount.  The contract for sale was dissolved in October 2016 and we utilized an updated appraisal as the determinant of value.  The loan has a maturity date of February 2017 which triggered an appraisal on the  as-is  basis to determine its current value resulting in a specific reserve of   $6.1 million   on the mezzanine tranches of the loan.  The second loan, a hotel located in Tucson, AZ, was supported by a broker quote  
  
    (Back to Index)

     (Back to Index)  

received during the December 2015 audit review.   After the property had a modification of terms with the operating manager an updated appraisal was requested which applied updated assumptions to the cash flow analysis of the property.  The appraisal returned an  as-stabilized  value below our cost basis and as a result, the mezzanine tranche of   $2.0 million   was fully reserved.  The senior tranche of the loan is held in RREF CDO 2007-1.  The provisions recorded against the loans reflect the estimated recoverable value.  These and other assets in the loan pool continue to be monitored consistent with our impairment evaluation process.  During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded an allowance for loan loss on a subordinated mezzanine loan position that was acquired in 2007.  The outstanding loan balance of $38.1 million was fully reserved and associated accrued interest of $3.0 million was reversed against interest income, for a total charge to operations of $41.1 million.  The loan was originally supported by a portfolio of 13 hotel properties, most of which were luxury brand hotels.  As of June 2015, of the original 13 hotel properties securing the loan, three properties remained, all of which were located in or near San Juan, Puerto Rico.  As a result of economic and credit disruptions in Puerto Rico, we determined that the loan was impaired and required a full reserve as of June 2015.  
  Bank loan portfolio provision -   The bank loan provision   decreased   by   $613,000   and   $2.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  These decreases are due to the call and liquidation of Apidos CDO III in June 2015 and the deconsolidation of Apidos Cinco CDO on January 1, 2016.  The recovery recorded in 2016 is due to receiving a cash payment on a position that was previously written-off at the time of liquidation.  
    Middle market loan portfolio provision -   The middle market loan provision   decreased   by   $782,000   and   increased   by   $8.0 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a provision of approximately   $121,000  , relating to an additional loss on the sale of Northport TRS, LLC.  For the nine months ended, we recorded a provision of   $12.2 million  , of which $9.2 million related to the sale of Northport TRS, LLC, and $3.4 million related to the one direct origination loan we retained following the sale, offset by a $480,000 improvement in fair value mark on another position.

Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries.   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries   increased     $698,000   and   $4.2 million   to   $1.0 million   and   $6.0 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   respectively, as compared to   $334,000   and   $1.7 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  An increase in earnings of approximately $485,000 and $2.6 million, respectively, was primarily related to two of our previously consolidated VIEs, RCM Global and Pelium, which are now accounted for as equity method investments due to a new amendment to the consolidation guidance which we adopted on January 1, 2016.  We also recognized a gain from our equity investment in Pearlmark for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $132,000 and $551,000, respectively.  We did not begin recognizing income from this investment until the fourth quarter of 2015.   In addition, our investment in Leaf Commercial Capital realized a $1.4 million increase in income year over year due to increased lease originations.   
  Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on sales of investment securities available-for-sale and loans.    Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities available-for-sale and loans   decreased     $12.6 million   and   $24.4 million   to a losses of   $10.1 million   and   $7.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively as compared to gains of   $2.5 million   and   $16.6 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  These losses are primarily attributable to a $9.6 million loss recorded on one of the retained middle market direct origination loans that is included in loans held for sale as of September 30, 2016.  This loan missed payment on its last two interest payments and the loan was marked down based on an external third party valuation.  In addition, during 2015, we recognized increased gains related to the net gain on the sale and settlement of certain securities in the RCM Global portfolio, and the in-kind distribution and subsequent sale of those securities, net realized and unrealized gains on foreign exchange transactions from the settlement of contracts, and unrealized gains on interest rate lock commitments on our residential loan portfolio.  We had no such gains during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  In addition, the RCM Global portfolio was deconsolidated effective January 1, 2016 and as a result our investment is now accounted for as an equity method investment. 
  Net realized and unrealized (loss) gain on investment securities, trading.    Net realized and unrealized (loss) gain on investment securities, trading   increased     $338,000   and decreased   $1.7 million   to a loss of   $242,000   and a gain of   $86,000   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to a loss of   $580,000   and a gain of   $1.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The 2016 activity is related to the change in valuation of trading securities on our legacy portfolio.  The 2015 activity was primarily related to unrealized and realized gains recognized on Pelium Capital which invested in structured securities classified as trading securities. The Pelium Capital portfolio was deconsolidated effective January 1, 2016 and is now accounted for as an equity method investment. 
    Loss on reissuance/gain on extinguishment of debt.    Loss on reissuance/gain on extinguishment of debt was   $332,000   and   $1.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  There were no gains or losses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The transactions that give rise to the recognition of a loss on the reissuance of debt resulted from the reissuance of previously repurchased senior and junior notes in our consolidated VIEs in the open market.  These senior and junior notes were originally repurchased at discounts to par and represented an opportunity to provide us strategic  
  
    (Back to Index)  
  85 

     (Back to Index)  

financing at beneficial rates upon reissuance.  At the date these notes were repurchased, a gain, representing the difference between the repurchase price and the par value of the note, was recognized.  As the same notes are reissued at a price less than par, an unrealized loss equal to the difference between the reissued price and the par value of the note is recognized in current earnings.     
    Other income (expense).   Other income (expense) increased   $1.5 million   for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This income represents a consent fee paid to us by Resource America at the closing of the C-III merger on September 8, 2016 in exchange for the authorization and approval to waive our rights under the management agreement to terminate the agreement as a result of a change in control of our manager. 
   
  Financial Condition 
  Summary. 
  Our total assets were   $2.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $2.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in total assets was principally due to the adoption of the consolidation guidance on VIEs and the resulting deconsolidation of the following entities:  RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1, Apidos Cinco CDO, Pelium Capital and RCM Global.  In addition, we sold substantially all of our direct origination middle market loans and one syndicated loan with a par balance of $257.3 million with the sale of Northport TRS, LLC, which closed on August 4, 2016.   In addition, Impairment losses taken on investment securities available-for-sale and intangible assets, provisions for loan loss, and the recognition of deferred tax asset valuation adjustments recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 also had a significant impact on the decrease of our assets. 
  Investment Portfolio.

    Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market. Amortized cost approximates fair value. 
         Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities-Private Placement.    In the aggregate, we purchased our CMBS portfolio at a net premium to par value.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the remaining discount to be accreted into income over the remaining lives of the securities was   $323,000   and   $1.7 million  , respectively.  This decrease is primarily due to the deconsolidation of RREF CDO 2006-1 and RREF CDO 2007-1 and the underlying collateral held at these entities.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the remaining premium to be amortized into income over the remaining lives of the securities was   $42,000   and   $710,000  , respectively.  These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, as a result, are carried at their fair value. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a   $732,000   other-than-temporary impairment on one position that supported our CMBS investments bringing the fair value to $3.2 million.  An approval to sell and the current price yielded a value that was less than a full recovery of our cost basis.  The net impairment losses were recognized in earnings in our consolidated statements of operations.  During the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2015, we had no losses included in earnings due to other-than-temporary impairment.

S  ecurities classified as available-for-sale have decreased on a net basis as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to   December 31, 2015   primarily due to the deconsolidation of RREF CDO 2006-1 and RREF CDO 2007-1 effective January 1, 2016, and to $25.0 million of paydowns during the period.  We perform an on-going review of third-party reports and updated financial data on the underlying property financial information to analyze current and projected loan performance.  Rating agency downgrades are considered with respect to our income approach when determining other-than-temporary impairment and, when inputs are stressed, the resulting projected cash flows reflect a full recovery of principal.

As a result of updated accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2016 we deconsolidated all of the assets of Pelium, which resulted in the removal of $21.9 million of investment securities, trading from our balance sheet, which is the primary cause of the decrease during the period.  We sold   no   securities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  We sold   19   securities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , for a net realized gain of approximately   $1.4 million  .  We held   6   and   56   investment securities, trading as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Real Estate Loans.    The following table is a summary of the loans in our commercial real estate loan portfolio (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Whole loans had   $67.3 million   and   $112.6 million   in unfunded loan commitments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  These unfunded commitments are advanced as the borrowers formally request additional funding as permitted under the loan agreement and any necessary approvals have been obtained.

               (10) 
    As a result of RREF CDO 2006-1 being called and liquidated on April 25, 2016, a mezzanine loan with a par value of   $28.8 million   was acquired as part of the liquidation proceeds and is reflected on the Company's balance sheet at a fair value of   zero   at   September 30, 2016  .   The mezzanine loan is comprised of two tranches, with maturity dates of November 2016 and September 2021.

Middle market loans.    At   September 30, 2016  , our middle market loan portfolio had loans held for investment with a carrying value of $51.5 million and loans held for sale with a fair value of $7.2 million.  The aggregate fair value of middle market loans held decreased by   $318.2 million   over the fair value at   December 31, 2015  .  This decrease was due to the sale of Northport TRS, LLC consisting of $257.3 million par amount of direct originated loans held by it as well as loans paying off as well as by reductions in new originations in the middle market platform prior to the sale of Northport TRS, LLC.

Asset-backed Securities.    At   September 30, 2016  , we held a total of   $153.1 million   of ABS at fair value through RCC Real Estate, Resource TRS III, RCC Residential, Resource TRS and RCC Commercial II.  At   December 31, 2015  , we held a total of   $44.2 million   of ABS at fair value through Apidos Cinco CDO, RCM Global, ZAIS and RCC Commercial II.  The increase in total ABS was due to the reclassification of investments in deconsolidated entities RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1 and Apidos Cinco CDO to asset-backed securities that occurred during the first quarter 2016.

The following table summarizes our ABS at fair value (in thousands): 

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $20.7 million   of other-than-temporary impairment on our previously consolidated CRE CDO, RREF 2007-1, which is classified as an investment securities available-for-sale.  Our security interest in the vehicle is supported by 12 CMBS securities and seven CRE loans.  Third-party appraisals were obtained on six of the seven remaining legacy CRE loans, which are part of the asset pool of RREF CDO 2007-1.  The remaining loan was under an agreement of sale.  As a result of having the collateral properties appraised, two of the CRE loans in the vehicle were determined to have cost bases in excess of their expected cash flows, as a result of the updated appraisals, causing a collective impairment charge to the cash flows of the vehicle of   $20.7 million  .  The impairment charge on the security reflects the credit impact to the fair value of the security given the results of the updated appraisal and reduces our cost basis in the security permanently.  The impairment charge was calculated by comparing the previous projected cash flows of the security to the revised cash flows including the results of the updated appraisals.  
  Corporate bonds  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we held no corporate bonds on our balance sheet as a result of the deconsolidation of Apidos Cinco CDO on January 1, 2016.  At   December 31, 2015  , Apidos Cinco CDO, held a total of   $2.3 million   of corporate bonds at fair value, which secure the debt issued by this entity.  We recorded the bonds at fair value, with any unrealized gain or loss reported in the stockholder s equity section of the balance sheet.

Credit quality indicators 
  Commercial Real Estate Loans 
  Loans are graded at inception and updates to assigned grades are made continually as new information is received, as such, a loan previously rated 4 may, over time and with improved performance, be rated better than 4. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 4 with 1 representing our highest rating and 4 representing our lowest rating. Commercial real estate loans are first individually evaluated for impairment. To the extent no individual impairment is determined, a general reserve is established. 
    
  The characteristics of each rating category are as follows: 
    
           1. 
    A loan with a rating of a 1 is considered to have satisfactory performance with no issues noted. All interest and principal payments are current and the probability of loss is remote; 
              2. 
    A loan is graded with a rating of a 2 if a surveillance trigger event has occurred, but loss is not probable at this time. Such trigger events could include but are not limited to a trending decrease in occupancy rates or a flattening of lease revenues; and to a lesser extent, ground lease defaults, ground lease expirations that occur in the next six months or the borrower is delinquent on payment of property taxes or insurance.; 
              3. 
    A loan with a rating of 3 has experienced an extended decline in operating performance, a significant deviation from its origination plan or the occurrence of one or more surveillance trigger events which create an increased risk for potential default.  Loans identified in this category show some liquidity concerns. However, the risk of loss is not specifically assignable to any individual loan. The noted risk of the loans in this category is generally covered by general reserves; 
              4. 
    A loan with a rating of a 4 is considered to be in payment default or default is expected, full recovery of the unpaid principal balance is improbable and loss is considered probable. The noted risk of the loans in this category is covered by specific reserves. 
     Credit risk profiles of commercial real estate loans were as follows (in thousands): 

(1) 
    The Company has one mezzanine loan with a par value of   $28.8 million   that was acquired at a fair value of   zero   as a result of the liquidation of RREF 2006-1. 
         
  As part of our ongoing loan monitoring, third-party appraisal services were obtained on   six   legacy CRE loans during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  As a result of the evaluation of those appraisals, it was determined that two loans previously disclosed as impaired loans, one in Studio City, CA with an amortized cost of   $27.5 million   and the other in Tucson, AZ with an amortized cost of   $2.0 million  , had cost bases in excess of their appraised values.  As such, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded specific provisions of   $6.1 million   on the Studio City, CA loan and   $2.0 million   on the Tucson, AZ loan.  Previously, the Studio City, CA loan was under contract for sale at a value in excess of our loan amount.  The contract for sale was terminated in October 2016.  The Tucson, AZ loan was previously supported by a broker s opinion of value received as of December 31, 2015.  The updated appraisal, after factoring in modified terms with the operating manager, and adjustments to projected occupancy and the average daily rate, returned a fair value below our cost basis, resulting in the full impairment of the portion of this whole loan held directly on balance sheet.  A portion of this whole loan is also held in RREF CDO 2007-1.  The provisions recorded against these loans reflect the estimated recoverable value.  These and other assets in the loan pool continue to be monitored consistent with our impairment evaluation process.

We also had six loans classified as rating 2 due to surveillance triggers being registered.  Of the six loans, several will be classified as loans held for sale as of December 31, 2016.   The other   two   loans had surveillance trigger events due to a mechanics lien and a code violation.  These   two   loans were not considered impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
  All of our commercial real estate loans were current with exception of   one   mezzanine loan that had defaulted as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  This loan was deconsolidated as part of our adoption of amendments to consolidation accounting guidance as required on January 1, 2016.  However, as a result of RREF CDO 2006-1 being called and liquidated on April 25, 2016, par value of   $28.8 million   of this mezzanine loan was acquired as part of the liquidation proceeds and is reflected on our balance sheet at a fair value of   zero   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Bank Loans 
  Loans are graded at inception and updates to assigned grades are made continually as new information is received. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 representing our highest rating and 5 representing our lowest rating. Bank loans are first individually evaluated for impairment. To the extent no individual impairment is determined, a general reserve is established.  
  The characteristics of each rating category are as follows: 
           1. 
    Loans with a rating of 1 are considered performing within expectations. All interest and principal payments are current, all future payments are anticipated and loss is not probable;   
              2. 
    Loans with a rating of a 2 are considered to have limited liquidity concerns and are watched closely.  Loans identified in this category show remote signs of liquidity concerns, loss is not probable and therefore no reserve is established; 
              3. 
    Loans with a rating of a 3 are considered to have possible future liquidity concerns.  Loans identified in this category show some liquidity concerns, but the ability to estimate potential defaults is not quantifiable and therefore no reserve is established; 
              4. 
    Loans with a rating of a 4 are considered to have nearer term liquidity concerns.  These loans have a reasonable possibility of future default. However, the risk of loss is not assignable to one specific credit. The noted risk of the loans in this category is covered by general reserves; and 
              5. 
    Loans with a rating of a 5 have defaulted in payment of principal and interest or default is imminent.  It is probable that impairment has occurred on these loans based on their payment status and that impairment is estimable.  The noted risk of the loans in this category is covered by specific reserves. 
     Credit risk profiles of bank loans were as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016   all of our bank loans were deconsolidated.  As of   December 31, 2015  , all of our bank loans were current with respect to debt service with the exception of   one   loan with an aggregate amortized cost of   $1.5 million  , on which there was a reserve.

Middle Market Loans 
  At inception, all middle market loans are graded at a 2.  Updates to assigned grades are made continually as new information is received. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 representing our highest rating and 5 representing our lowest rating. Middle market loans are only evaluated individually for impairment. 
    
  The characteristics of each rating category are as follows: 
    
           1. 
    A loan with a rating of a 1 is considered performing above expectations and the likelihood of loss is remote; 
              2. 
    A loan with a rating of a 2 is considered performing within expectations and the likelihood of loss is remote;  
              3. 
    A loan with a rating of a 3 is considered performing below expectations and requires close monitoring but no loss of interest or principal is expected. Loans receiving this rating may be out of compliance with financial covenants; however, these loans are current with respect to interest and principal;  
              4. 
    A loan with a rating of a 4 is considered performing below expectations and some loss of interest or dividend is expected but no loss of principal. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not more than 180 days past due;  and  
              5. 
    A loan with a rating of a 5 is considered performing substantially below expectations, in default and some loss of principal is expected. The borrower is out of compliance with most or all of the debt covenants and payments are substantially delinquent.  
     Credit risk profiles of middle market loans were as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our syndicated loans were performing and   one   remaining directly originated loan classified as held for sale was in default.  The Company recorded an additional unrealized loss on this loan of   $9.6 million  , included in the net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on sales of investment securities available-for-sale and loans and derivatives line item on the consolidated statement of operations, representing the lower of the loan's cost or fair value based on an updated third party valuation as of   September 30, 2016  .  The rest of the Company's portfolio is current with respect to debt service.  All of the Company s middle market loans were current with respect to debt service as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Residential Mortgage Loans 
  Residential mortgage loans are reviewed periodically for collectability in light of historical experience, the nature and amount of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing underlying conditions. 
  Direct Financing Leases 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a provision against the value of our direct financing leases in the amount of   $465,000  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held   $571,000   of direct financing leases, net of reserves.

Troubled-Debt Restructurings 
  The following tables show troubled-debt restructurings in our loan portfolio (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no commercial real estate loan troubled-debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted. 
   
  Restricted Cash 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had restricted cash of   $5.7 million  , which consisted of   $5.5 million   of restricted cash held by   six   securitizations,   $30,000   held as margin and   $197,000   held in various reserve accounts.  At   December 31, 2015  , we had restricted cash of   $40.6 million  , which consisted of   $39.0 million   of restricted cash in our   eight   securitizations,   $1.4 million   held as margin and   $195,000   held in various reserve accounts.  The decrease of   $34.9 million   is primarily related to the deconsolidation of Apidos Cinco CDO, which had $16.7 million in restricted cash and also a reduction of $17.7 million of restricted cash in our CRE securitizations used to fund our future funding commitments as well as the return of a margin posting of $500,000.

Interest Receivable 
  The following table summarizes our interest receivable as of the periods indicated (in thousands): 

At   September 30, 2016  , we had interest receivable of   $6.6 million  , which primarily consisted of interest on our loans and securities and   $6,000   of interest earned on escrow and sweep accounts.  At December 31, 2015, we had interest receivable of   $14.0 million  , which primarily consisted of interest on our loans, securities and an equity investment in a warehouse facility and   $6,000   of interest earned on escrow and sweep account.  The   $7.4 million   decrease was primarily attributable to the deconsolidation of Pelium Capital, Apidos Cinco CDO, RREF CDO 2006-1 and RREF CDO 2007-1.  As a result of the new accounting guidance, all of the assets of these four entities were deconsolidated on January 1, 2016.  The sale of Northport TRS, LLC in August 2016 also resulted in a reduction of interest receivable of approximately $2.1 million.  Additionally, there was a decrease in interest receivable of   $1.2 million   related to the closing of ZAIS, our syndicated bank loans warehouse, in May 2016. 
   
  Deferred Tax Assets 
  Deferred tax assets, net,   decreased     $7.0 million   to   $5.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $12.6 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The future realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  Due to changes in management's focus regarding the non-CRE businesses, forecasted taxable income as of September 30, 2016 versus June 30, 2016 decreased; therefore, management believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from these deferred tax assets will not be completely realized.  In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $16.3 million on deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016.  We will continue to evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies.  The net income tax expense recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was   $12.3 million   which consists of   $4.0 million   of tax benefits attributable to operating loss incurred during the quarter and a   $16.3 million   valuation allowance.  

Prepaid Expenses 
  The following table summarizes our prepaid expenses at the periods indicated (in thousands): 

Prepaid expenses increased   $1.4 million   to   $4.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $3.2 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The primary cause was an increase in prepaid taxes of   $1.1 million   due to the payment of estimated taxes during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Additionally, prepaid insurance increased   $191,000   due to the timing of payments on the annual renewal of our director's and officer's insurance policy and an increase in other prepaid expenses of   $189,000  .

Other Assets 
  The following table summarizes our other assets as of the periods indicated (in thousands): 

The decrease of approximately   $9.8 million   in other assets is primarily due to a decrease in other receivables of   $10.6 million  ; $8.6 million of this amount relates to the cash received as a return of principal from our investment in CVC Credit Opportunities Fund, L.P., $850,000 of this amount relates to a receivable accrued in December 2015 for a cash distribution from RCC 2015-CRE3; and $400,000 relates to a decrease in the amount of a loan receivable due from LCF to fund new life settlement contracts, partially offset by other miscellaneous receivables.  Additionally, there was a decrease in management fees receivable of   $1.1 million   due to an incentive management fee earned on RCAM in December 2015 and paid in January 2016.  These decreases were offset by an increase of   $1.4 million   in life settlement contracts from the net acquisition of new contracts, an increase in  $409,000   of tax receivable due to the timing of tax payments made, and an increase of   $48,000   due to the acquisition of fixed assets at PCM.

    Borrowings under our repurchase agreement facilities were guaranteed by us or one of our subsidiaries.  The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our borrowings as of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 

We   obtained three waivers of the EBITDA to fixed charge coverage ratio covenants for our CRE repurchase facilities and Wells Fargo CMBS repurchase facility as of   September 30, 2016  .  We continuously monitor our compliance with all of the financial covenants. We are in compliance with all other financial covenants as defined in the respective agreements as of   September 30, 2016  .     
   
  Residential Investments   Term Repurchase Facility 
    In June 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, RCC Resi Portfolio, RCC Resi TRS, and RCC Resi Depositor (the  Sellers ) entered into a master repurchase and securities contract (the  2014 Facility ) with Wells Fargo Bank, NA ("Wells Fargo").  Under the 2014 Facility, from time to time, the parties may enter into transactions in which the Sellers and Wells Fargo agree to transfer from the Sellers to Wells Fargo all of their right, title and interest to certain residential mortgage backed securities and other assets against the transfer of funds by Wells Fargo to the Sellers, with a simultaneous agreement by Wells Fargo to transfer back to the

Sellers such assets at a date certain or on demand, against the transfer of funds from the Sellers to Wells Fargo. In July 2016, we elected to terminate the 2014 Facility. 

CRE - Term Repurchase Facilities 
    On February 27, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, RCC Real Estate SPE 4 LLC ("SPE 4"), entered into a master repurchase and securities agreement (the "2012 Facility") with Wells Fargo to finance the origination of commercial real estate loans. In   July 2016   in exchange for applicable structuring and extension fees, we entered into a fifth amendment of the 2012 Facility which extended the current term to   July 2018   with   three   additional   one year   extension options exercisable at our option. 

Residential Mortgage Financing Agreements 
  In February 2011, PCM entered into a master repurchase agreement (the "New Century Facility") with New Century Bank d/b/a Customer's Bank ("New Century") to finance the acquisition of residential mortgage loans. In   August 2016  , PCM entered into a tenth amendment of the New Century Facility which extended the facility through   December 2016   and reduced the maximum borrowing amount from   $65.0 million   to   $50.0 million   through   October 2016   then to   $35.0 million   through   November 2016   and finally to   $25.0 million   through   December 2016  . The New Century Facility's tenth amendment increases the interest margins following the   October 2016   maximum amount reduction. New Century's compliance with purchase requests will no longer be required effective   November 2016  .  No other material changes were made to the New Century Facility's terms. 
  In July 2014, PCM entered into a master repurchase agreement (the "Wells Fargo Facility") with Wells Fargo to finance the acquisition of residential mortgage loans.  In May 2016, PCM amended its agreement with Wells Fargo to increase the maximum of the amount of the Wells Fargo Facility from   $100.0 million   to   $115.0 million   for the period from May 2016 to June 2016. In June 2016, PCM amended its agreement with Wells Fargo to increase the maximum of the amount of the Wells Fargo Facility from   $115.0 million   to   $150.0 million  .  In   August 2016  , PCM entered into a seventh amendment of the Wells Fargo Facility to extend the facility to   November 2016  . No other material changes were made to the Wells Fargo Facility's terms.  
   
  Securitizations 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had executed   eight   and currently retain equity in eight of these securitizations.  Pertinent information about our securitizations that occurred during the first   nine   months of 2016 is as follows:  
              
       On April 25, 2016, we called RREF CDO 2006-1 and in exchange for our equity notes and preference share, received the remaining collateral.  
      
  Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement 
  On August 4, 2016, we sold Northport TRS, LLC to CVC Credit Partners, an affiliated party, and to other third parties.  This transaction included the assumption of the senior secured revolving credit agreement by the purchasers. 
   
  Equity 
  Total equity at   September 30, 2016   was   $718.6 million   and gave effect to   $42,000   of unrealized losses on our cash flow hedges and   $7.0 million   of net unrealized gains on our available-for-sale portfolio, shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  Equity at   December 31, 2015   was   $826.8 million   and gave effect to   $131,000   of unrealized losses on our cash flow hedges and   $835,000   of net unrealized losses on our available-for-sale portfolio, shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  The decrease in equity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was principally due to the deconsolidation of RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1, Apidos Cinco CDO, Pelium Capital and RCM Global as a result of the consolidation guidance on variable interest entities which we adopted on January 1, 2016.  Impairment losses taken on investment securities available-for-sale and intangible assets, provisions for loan loss, and the recognition of deferred tax asset valuation adjustments recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 also had a significant impact on the decrease of our equity from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  In addition, equity also decreased due to stock repurchases and distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in excess of earnings.

Funds from Operations 
  We evaluate our performance based on several performance measures, including Funds From operations, or FFO, and Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO, in addition to net income. We compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses on the sale of depreciable real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated/uncombined partnerships and joint ventures. 
  AFFO is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company s operating performance. We calculate AFFO by adding or subtracting from FFO the impact of non-cash accounting items as well as the effects of items that we deem to be non-recurring in nature. We deem transactions to be non-recurring if a similar transaction has not occurred in the past two years, and if we do not expect a similar transaction to occur in the next two years. We adjust for these non-cash and nonrecurring items to analyze our ability to produce cash flow from on-going operations, which we have used to pay dividends to our shareholders. Non-cash adjustments to FFO include the following: impairment losses resulting from fair value adjustments on financial instruments; provisions for loan losses; equity investment gains and losses; straight-line rental effects; share based compensation expense; amortization of various deferred items and intangible assets; gains on sales of property that are wholly owned or owned through a joint venture; the cash impact of capital expenditures that are related to our real estate owned; and REIT tax planning adjustments, which primarily relate to accruals for owned properties for which we made a foreclosure election and adjustments to tax estimates with respect to the final resolution of foreclosed property when it is listed for sale. In addition, we calculate AFFO by adding and subtracting from FFO the realized cash impacts of the following: extinguishment of debt, reissuances of debt, sales of property and capital expenditures. 
  Management believes that FFO and AFFO are appropriate measures of our operating performance in that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties in the evaluation of REITs. Management uses FFO and AFFO as measures of our operating performance, and believes they are also useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of our operating performance apart from non-cash and non-recurring items, which may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance and may not allow accurate period to period comparisons of our operating performance. 
  Although our calculations of AFFO may differ from the methodology used for calculating AFFO by other REITs and our FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs, we also believe that FFO and AFFO may provide us and our investors with an additional useful measure to compare our performance with some other REITs. Neither FFO nor AFFO is equivalent to net income or cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, FFO and AFFO do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Neither FFO nor AFFO should be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our principal sources of liquidity were: liquidation of our investment in CVC Global Opportunities Fund, LP which returned $8.6 million of principal in January 2016, proceeds from our CRE securitizations which purchased future funding commitments utilizing repaid principal of $4.9 million, and $104 million in proceeds from the sale of our Northport TRS, LLC middle market loan portfolio. These sources of liquidity principally provided the bulk of   $114.6 million   of unrestricted cash we held at   September 30, 2016  .  In addition as of September 30, 2016, we had capital available through a CMBS term facility to help finance the purchase of CMBS securities of   $81.4 million   and   $312.4 million   combined from two CRE term facilities for the origination of commercial real estate loans.   
  On February 27, 2012, we entered into a master repurchase and securities agreement (the "Wells CRE Facility ) with Wells Fargo Bank, NA to finance the origination of commercial real estate loans. On October 31, 2014, we agreed to a modification of the terms of the Wells CRE Facility. The modification increases the facility maximum by $150.0 million to $400.0 million. On July 21, 2016, we agreed to a modification of the terms of the Wells CRE Facility. The modification extends the facility's maturity date to July 21, 2018, subject to three one-year extension rights which may extend the maturity to July 21, 2021. The amendment also modified certain financing rates and required debt yields. We paid extension fees as well as other standard closing costs. 
  On September 20, 2015, we entered into a master repurchase and securities agreement (the "Morgan Stanley Facility ) with Morgan Stanley Bank, NA to finance the origination of commercial real estate loans. We paid a commitment fee as well as other standard closing costs. The Morgan Stanley Facility has a maximum capacity of $250.0 million and an initial three year term that expires on September 10, 2018 with annual one year extension options. 
   In February 2011, we entered into a master repurchase and securities agreement ("Wells CMBS Facility") to finance the purchase of CMBS. The maximum amount of the Wells CMBS Facility is $100.0 million and had an original two year term with a one year option to extend. In April 2014, we agreed to a third amendment of the facility, which extended the termination date to January 31, 2016. In May 2015, we agreed to a fourth amendment of the facility, which extended the termination date to January 31, 2017. We may enter into interest rate swaps and cap agreements for securities whose average life exceeds two years to mitigate interest rate risk under the Wells CMBS Facility. 
  During the second quarter 2015, we entered into the first and second amendments of Northport TRS, LLC's Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement ("Northport Credit Facility"), which increased the original commitment from   $225.0 million   to   $300.0 million   and secured   $85.0 million   of additional availability, bringing the total available under the Northport Credit Facility to   $225.0 million  .  On August 1, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to sell our interest in Northport TRS, LLC for $247.0 million. The transaction, which closed on August 4, 2016, included substantially all of the direct origination middle market loans and one syndicated loan with a par balance of $257.3 million and the assumption of the Northport Credit Facility by the purchaser, for net proceeds of approximately $104.2 million.  
  During the   year ended December 31, 2015  , our principal sources of liquidity were: net proceeds from our 8.0% convertible notes offering on January 13, 2015 of $97.0 million, the return of equity at the close of RCC 2015-CRE3 on February 24, 2015 of $78.0 million, the return of equity at the close of RCC 2015-CRE4 on August 18, 2015 of $29.7 million, liquidation of Moselle CLO S.A. which returned $30.0 million (which included $1.0 million of proceeds from forward currency contracts), liquidation of Apidos CDO III in June 2015 which returned $12.8 million of principal, cash flow from operations and $3.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of our 8.25% Series B Preferred Stock through our at the market, or ATM, program in January 2015. These sources of liquidity provided the bulk of the $78.8 million of unrestricted cash we held at   December 31, 2015  .  In addition, we had capital available through a CMBS term facility to help finance the purchase of CMBS securities of $74.4 million and $425.0 million combined from two CRE term facilities for the origination of commercial real estate loans. 
   Our on-going liquidity needs consist principally of funds to make investments, make debt repurchases, make distributions to our stockholders and pay our operating expenses, including management fees.  Our ability to meet our on-going liquidity needs will be subject to our ability to generate cash from operations and, with respect to our investments, our ability to maintain and/or obtain additional debt financing and equity capital together with the funds referred to above.   
   Since December 2013, we have met a significant portion of our debt funding requirements for CRE loans through securitizations. In February 2015, we closed a $346.2 million CRE securitization, and in August 2015, we closed a $312.9 million CRE securitization, which brings our total to just in excess of $1.3 billion of mortgage loans financed during that period. We expect to derive substantial operating cash from our equity investments in the four newest securitizations, which do not have the same asset and interest coverage tests as are required by our legacy CRE CDOs. These CRE securitizations do not have reinvestment periods; however, principal payments, for a stipulated period, may be used to purchase funding participations with respect to existing collateral held outside of the securitizations. This will allow us to recycle some capital repaid and convert the designated

principal for funding companion loan participations, which would otherwise be used to pay down the most senior notes and reduce leverage and potential returns within the securitization. 
  Historically, we have financed a substantial portion of our portfolio investments through securitized notes that essentially match the maturity and repricing dates of these financing vehicles with the maturities and repricing dates of our investments, and, in view of current market conditions, we may continue to seek this type of securitization financing.  We derive substantial operating cash from our equity investments in our securitizations which, if the securitizations fail to meet certain tests, will cease.  Through   September 30, 2016  , we have not experienced difficulty in maintaining our existing securitized note financing and have passed all of the critical tests required by these financings.  However, we cannot assure you that we will meet all such critical tests in the future.  If we are unable to renew, replace or expand our sources of existing financing on substantially similar terms, we may be unable to implement our investment strategies successfully and may be required to liquidate portfolio investments.  If required, a sale of portfolio investments could be at prices lower than the carrying value of such assets, which would result in losses and reduced income. 
  The following table sets forth the distributions made and coverage test summaries for each of our securitizations for the periods presented (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Interest coverage includes annualized amounts based on the most recent trustee statements. 
              (2) 
    Interest coverage cushion represents the amount by which annualized interest income expected exceeds the annualized amount payable on all classes of securitization notes senior to our preference shares. 
              (3) 
    Overcollateralization cushion represents the amount by which the collateral held by the securitization issuer exceeds the maximum amount required. 
               (5) 
    The reinvestment period for Resource Capital Corp. 2014-CRE2 ended in July 2016. The indenture does not contains any interest coverage test provisions. 
              (6) 
    Resource Capital Corp. 2015-CRE3 closed on February 24, 2015; the first distribution was in March 2015.  There is no reinvestment period; however, principal repayments, for a period ending in February 2017, may be designated to purchase loans held outside of the securitization that represent the funded commitments of existing collateral in the securitization that were not funded as of the date the securitization was closed.  Additionally, the indenture does not contain any interest coverage test provisions. 
              (7) 
    Resource Capital Corp. 2015-CRE4 closed on August 18, 2015; the first distribution was in September 2015.  There is no reinvestment period; however, principal repayments, for a period ending in August 2017, may be designated to purchase loans held outside of the securitization that represent the funded commitments of existing collateral in the securitization that were not funded as of the date the securitization was closed.  Additionally, the indenture does not contain any interest coverage test provisions. 
              (8) 
    Moselle CLO S.A. was acquired on February 24, 2014 and the reinvestment period for this securitization expired prior to the acquisition.  In the fourth quarter of 2014 we began to liquidate Moselle CLO S.A. and, by January 2015, all of the assets were sold.  
              (9) 
    RREF CDO 2006-1 was liquidated on April 25, 2016 and as a result, all $66.3 million of the remaining assets were returned to us in exchange for our preference shares and equity notes in the securitization.

At October 31, 2016, RSO's liquidity is derived from three primary sources: 
             
    unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $108.9 million and restricted cash of $30,000 in margin call accounts;  
                
    capital available for reinvestment in two of RSO's CRE securitizations of $4.9 million, all of which is designated to finance future funding commitments on CRE loans; and 
      We also had a combined $297.0 million available through two term financing facilities to finance the origination of CRE loans and $74.3 million available through a term financing facility to finance the purchase of CMBS.     
  Our leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of borrowings to stockholders' equity may vary as a result of the various funding strategies we use.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our leverage ratio was 1.9 times and 2.3 times, respectively.  Our leverage has decreased primarily as a result of the deconsolidation of RREF CDO 2006-1, RREF CDO 2007-1 and Apidos Cinco CDO, offset by the reduction of stockholder's equity due to credit impairments and the fair value adjustment recorded through retained earnings on those deconsolidated entities, as well as repurchases of our common stock and Series B preferred stock. 
  Several of our legacy CDOs and CLOs have been liquidated over the last few years. This trend continued in 2016.  On April 25, 2016, we called and liquidated our investment in RREF CDO 2006-1. Our one remaining legacy CRE securitization and one remaining bank loan securitization have seen substantial pay downs of notes issued under their indentures as the underlying collateral has paid down or paid off in full.  The table and footnotes below indicate current assets and liabilites in these legacy securitizations as well as our remaining equity and, in the case of our legacy CRE CDO, our share of notes repurchased and discounted purchase price of those notes.  In the case of the CRE CDO, we expect to have assets distributed to us once the outstanding notes held by third parties have been paid off, which we anticipate in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Once the loan assets are distributed we expect to be able to finance the loan assets on existing credit facilities. 
  The following tables presents the legacy securitizations' (deconsolidated at January 1, 2016) remaining equity as of   September 30, 2016  :  

(1) 
    Subsequent to the closing of the securitization, we purchased notes in RREF CDO 2007-1 at substantial discounts to par.  Certain of those notes have either been repaid or canceled as of   September 30, 2016  .  Of those repurchased notes that have not been repaid, cash gains on the extinguishment of debt of $13.8 million has not been recognized in AFFO as of September 30, 2016 on $20.3 million of notes purchased at a weighted average price of $31.81.  Additionally, of those notes that were not canceled and included in the net equity held by us are $26.0 million of notes purchased at a weighted average price of $32.40 with $17.6 million that has not been recognized in AFFO as of September 30, 2016.

Of those repurchased notes that have not been repaid or canceled, cash gains on the extinguishment of debt of $21.4 million has not been recognized in AFFO prior to liquidation on $32.4 million of notes purchased at a weighted average price of $33.85.  We were able to finance a portion of the collateral after liquidation and recorded a cash gain on extinguishment adjustment of $6.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $15.1 million of cash gains remain unrecognized in AFFO.

Distributions 
  In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT and to minimize corporate-level income tax on our income, we intend to make regular quarterly distributions of all or substantially all of our net REIT taxable income to holders of our common stock.  This requirement can impact our liquidity and capital resources.   
  The following tables present dividends declared (on a per share basis) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   year ended December 31, 2015  .

Contractual Obligations and Commitments   

(1) 
    Contractual commitments include   $600,000   of interest expense payable through the maturity dates on our repurchase agreements. 
              (2) 
    Contractual commitments do not include   $29.7 million   and   $30.4 million   of estimated interest expense payable through the maturity dates of   June 2036   and October 2036, respectively, on our trust preferred securities. 
              (3) 
    Contractual commitments do not include   $17.5 million   of interest expense payable through the maturity date of   December 1, 2018   on our 6.0% Convertible Senior Notes. 
              (4) 
    Contractual commitments do not include   $28.4 million   of interest expense payable through the maturity date of   January 15, 2020   on our 8.0% Convertible Senior Notes. 
              (5) 
    Unfunded commitments on our originated CRE loans generally fall into two categories: (1) pre-approved capital improvement projects; and (2) new or additional construction costs subject, in each case, to the borrower meeting specified criteria.  Upon completion of the improvements or construction, we would receive additional loan interest income on the advanced amount.  
              (6) 
    On August 4, 2016, we sold Northport TRS, LLC.  This transaction included the assumption of the senior secured revolving credit agreement. 
              (7) 
    Calculated only for the next 12 months based on our current equity, as defined in our management agreement.  Our management agreement also provides for an incentive fee arrangement that is based on operating performance.  Because the incentive fee is not a fixed and determinable amount, it is not included in this table. 
              (8) 
    Contractual commitments on borrowings are presented net of deferred debt issuance costs. 
              (9) 
    We have committed to invest up to   $50.0 million   in Pearlmark Mezzanine Realty Partners IV, L.P.  The commitment termination date ends the earlier of when the original commitment is fully funded, or the fifth anniversary following the final closing date of June 24, 2015. 
      
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  General  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or contractually narrow or limited purposes, although we do have interests in unconsolidated entities not established for those purposes.  Except as set forth below, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had not guaranteed obligations of any such unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or letter of intent to provide additional funding to any such entities.  
  Unfunded Commercial Real Estate Loan Commitments    
  In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to borrowers whose loans are in our commercial real estate loan portfolio to provide additional loan funding in the future.  These commitments generally fall into two categories: (1) pre-approved capital improvement projects; and (2) new or additional construction costs.  Disbursement of funds pursuant to these commitments is subject to the borrower meeting pre-specified criteria.  Upon disbursement of funds, we receive loan interest income on any such advanced funds.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had 40 loans with unfunded commitments totaling $67.3 million, which we intend to fund through principal repayments on other loans in our portfolio and the ability to fund in our newest securitizations within a specified time period and cash flow from normal operating activities.  These commitments are subject to the same underwriting requirements and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we  
  
    (Back to Index)  
  112 

hold.  Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  
  Unfunded Middle Market Loan Commitments 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have one middle market loan, after the sale of Northport TRS, LLC, which had an unfunded commitment totaling $950,000. We intend to fund this commitment through cash flow from normal operating activities. Disbursement of funds pursuant to this commitment is subject to the borrower meeting pre-specified criteria and in some instances, discretion. Since this commitment may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
   
  Hedging Instruments 
  A significant market risk to us is interest rate risk.  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control.  Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with the interest-bearing liabilities, by affecting the spread between the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets.  A decline in the value of our interest-earning assets pledged as collateral for borrowings could result in the counterparties demanding additional collateral pledges or liquidation of some of the existing collateral to reduce borrowing levels. 
  We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, a form of risk that arises from the change in price of one currency against another.  Substantially all of our revenues are transacted in U.S. dollars; however, a portion of our capital is exposed to other currencies, primarily the Euro and, to a lesser extent, the pound sterling. To address this market risk, we generally hedge our foreign currency-denominated exposures (typically investments in debt instruments, including forecasted principal and interest payments) with foreign currency forward contracts. We classify these hedges as fair value hedges, which are hedges that mitigate the risk of changes in the fair values of assets, liabilities, and certain types of firm commitments.  We record changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and effective as fair value hedges in earnings offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items. 
  The following tables present the fair value of our derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on our consolidated balance sheets and on the consolidated statements of operations for the years presented:

  On January 1, 2016, we deconsolidated RREF CDO 2006-1 and RREF CDO 2007-1 in accordance with guidance on consolidation. This resulted in the deconsolidation of six CRE interest rate swaps. 
  During April 2016, we requested and canceled our remaining interest rate swap contract through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), to be amortized through earnings over the life of the remaining debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no interest rate swap contracts outstanding.

ITEM 3 . 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , the primary component of our market risk was interest rate risk, as described below.  While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we do seek to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience, to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify assuming that risk and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risk we undertake or to which we are exposed.  
  Effect on Fair Value  
  A component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the fair value of our assets.  We face the risk that the fair value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our liabilities, including our hedging instruments.  
  Primarily, we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities.  Duration essentially measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change.  Generally, we calculate duration using various financial models and empirical data.  Different models and methodologies can produce different duration numbers for the same securities.  
  The following sensitivity analysis tables present, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated impact on the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and liabilities of changes in interest rates, assuming rates instantaneously fall 100 basis points and rise 100 basis points (dollars in thousands):  

(1)  Includes the fair value of available-for-sale investments that are sensitive to interest rate change. 
  For purposes of the table, we have excluded our investments with variable interest rates that are indexed to LIBOR.  Because the variable rates on these instruments are short-term in nature, we are not subject to material exposure to movements in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates.  
  
    (Back to Index)  
  116 

It is important to note that the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change beyond 100 basis points from current levels.  Therefore, the volatility in the fair value of our assets could increase significantly when interest rates change beyond 100 basis points from current levels.  In addition, other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and hedging instruments, such as the shape of the yield curve, market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions.  Accordingly, in the event of changes in actual interest rates, the change in the fair value of our assets would likely differ from that shown above and such difference might be material and adverse to our stockholders.  
  Risk Management  
  To the extent consistent with maintaining our status as a REIT, we seek to manage our interest rate risk exposure to protect our portfolio of fixed-rate commercial real estate mortgages and CMBS and related debt against the effects of major interest rate changes.  We generally seek to manage our interest rate risk by:  
             
    monitoring and adjusting, if necessary, the reset index and interest rate related to our mortgage-backed securities and our borrowings;  
                
    attempting to structure our borrowing agreements for our CMBS to have a range of different maturities, terms, amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods; and  
                
    using derivatives, financial futures, swaps, options, caps, floors and forward sales, to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of our fixed-rate commercial real estate mortgages and CMBS and our borrowing which we discuss in  Financial Condition-Hedging Instruments.   

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
   
           ITEM 1.  
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
       
  In September 2015, Daren Levin filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock between March 2, 2015 and August 4, 2015.  In November 2015, the Court appointed Douglas Drees as the lead plaintiff in the action, and thereafter entered a stipulation and order directing the lead plaintiff to file an amended complaint.  In February 2016, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint, alleging that we and certain of our officers and directors materially misrepresented certain risks of our commercial loan portfolio and our processes and controls for assessing the quality of our portfolio.  Based on these allegations, the amended complaint asserts claims for violation of the securities laws and seeks a variety of relief, including unspecified monetary damages as well as costs and attorneys  fees.  In April 2016, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which the court denied on October 5, 2016; and the discovery process is now expected to commence. We believe the amended complaint is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.   
    
                In December 2015, Josh Reaves filed a shareholder derivative suit in the Supreme Court of New York alleging that our directors and certain officers breached their fiduciary duties by causing us to misrepresent certain risks of our commercial loan portfolio, by failing to employ adequate internal and financial controls and by failing to disclose the alleged internal control deficiencies.  The complaint purports to seek relief on behalf of us for unspecified damages as well as costs and attorneys  fees.  We believe that the plaintiff, who failed to make a pre-suit demand on the board of directors, lacks standing to assert claims derivatively on our behalf.  In April 2016, the parties entered into a stipulation staying this proceeding until such time as the court ruled on the motion to dismiss the Levin action referenced above or certain other triggering events occur.  That stay has now been lifted because the motion was to dismiss the Levin action was denied. 
  PCM is a party to various claims and legal proceedings at various times. If PCM believes that a loss arising from any of these matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, the loss is recorded. Currently, the only litigation involving PCM relates to claims for repurchases or indemnifications on loans that PCM has sold to investors.  Such claims are included in the reserve for mortgage repurchases and indemnifications.  The reserve for mortgage repurchases and indemnifications was   $5.2 million   and   $3.7 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  Loans on one-to-four family residential mortgages originated by PCM are sold to various financial institutions and governmental entities with representations and warranties that are usual and customary for the industry. In the event of a breach of any of the representations and warranties related to a loan sold, PCM may be required to indemnify the investor against future losses, repurchase the mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for actual losses incurred (referred to as  make whole payments ).  The maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of an indemnification or loan repurchase would be the unpaid principal balance of the loan along with any premium paid by the investor when the loan was purchased, accrued but unpaid interest and other minor cost reimbursements.  This maximum exposure is at least partially mitigated by the value of the collateral underlying the mortgage loan. 
  On May 13, 2014, ResCap Liquidating Trust ( ResCap ), as successor to Residential Funding Company, LLC ( RFC ), filed an adversary proceeding against PCM in United States Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York.  ResCap has sued some   90   sellers of residential mortgage loans for alleged breaches of warranty in various loans sold to RFC.  RFC contends that such breaches caused it damages from loan losses and liability to other transferee's of the loans.   
    
  As of September 30, 2016, outstanding demands for indemnification, repurchase or make whole payments totaled approximately $20.5 million, of which a substantial portion related to loans sold to four investors prior to 2011.  In October 2016, PCM reached agreements to settle repurchase claims with two of the four investors, including those subject to the litigation initiated by ResCap.  Pursuant to the settlement agreements,   $2.1 million   was fully reserved for at September 30, 2016.  These settlement agreements reduce the amount of outstanding demands against PCM for indemnification, repurchase and make whole payments to approximately $10.0 million. 
       
  The most significant remaining make whole demands against PCM are from Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc. ( LBHI ). On February 3, 2016, LBHI filed an adversary proceeding against PCM in United States Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York.  LBHI has sued approximately 145 sellers of residential mortgage loans for alleged breaches of warranty in various loans sold to it.  LBHI contends that such breaches caused it damages from loan losses and liability to other transferees of the loans.  PCM intends to defend the action vigorously.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative  
  Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative  
  Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Nothing in this paragraph shall relieve any Lender of its obligation  
  
        30  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

to fulfill its commitments hereunder, and shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.  
    SECTION 2.06.         Interest Elections  .  
  (a)  Elections by the Borrower for Borrowings  .  Subject to Section 2.03(d), the Loans constituting each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.    
  (b)  Notice of Elections  .  To make an election pursuant to this Section, the  
  Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a  
  Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, telecopy or electronic communication to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request signed by the Borrower.  
  (c)  Content of Interest Election Requests  .  Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:  
  (i)  the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);  
  (ii)  the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;  
  (iii)  whether the relevant Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and  
  
        31  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

(iv)  if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term  Interest Period  and permitted under Section 2.02(d).   
  (d)  Notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders  .  Promptly following  
  receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing.  
  (e)  Failure to Elect; Events of Default  .  If the Borrower fails to deliver a  
  timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a Eurocurrency Borrowing having an Interest Period of one month.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing no outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowing may have an Interest Period of more than one month s duration.  
    SECTION 2.07.         Termination or Reduction of the Commitments  .  
  (a)  Scheduled Termination  .  Unless previously terminated, the Commitments

  (c)  Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction  .  The Borrower shall notify  
  the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;   provided   that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state  
  
        32  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events, including credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the  
  Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  
  (d)  Effect of Termination or Reduction  .  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

If the Borrower fails to make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be applied, first, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings, and second, to any remaining Borrowings in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first).   
  Each payment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in such Borrowing.  
  (c)  Maintenance of Records by Lenders  .  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.  
  (d)  Maintenance of Records by the Administrative Agent  .  The Administrative  
  Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender of hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for account of the Lenders and each Lender s share thereof.

  (f)  Promissory Notes  .  Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be  
  evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent (and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower).  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

           (a) 
    Optional Prepayments  .  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and

     that at any time any Borrowing Base Deficiency shall exist, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in such amounts as shall be necessary so that such Borrowing Base Deficiency is immediately cured,   provided   that if, within five Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrating such Borrowing Base Deficiency (and/or at such other times as the Borrower has knowledge of such Borrowing Base Deficiency), the Borrower shall present the Administrative Agent with a reasonably feasible plan that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to enable such Borrowing Base Deficiency to be cured within 30 Business Days (which 30Business Day period shall include the five Business Days permitted for delivery of such plan), then such prepayment or reduction shall not be required to be effected immediately but may be effected in accordance with such plan (with such modifications as the Borrower may reasonably determine), so long as such Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured within such 30-Business Day period.  
           (d)

  (a)  If at the time that the Administrative Agent shall seek to determine the  
  Reference Bank Rate less than two Reference Banks shall supply a rate to the Administrative Agent for purposes of determining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Eurocurrency Borrowing, then such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing at the Alternate Base Rate (such rate, the    COF Rate   ).

The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  
    SECTION 2.14.         Increased Costs  .  
    (a)         If any Change in Law shall:  
  (i)  impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, compulsory loan, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

  Excluded Taxes) to such Lenders of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

        39  
  #4841-8625-7971v16

  Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or  
  continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO  
  Rate for such Interest Period,   over    
  
        40  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

(ii)  the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits denominated in Dollars from other banks in the eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period.  
  Payment under this Section shall be made upon request of a Lender delivered not later than ten Business Days following the payment, conversion, or failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay that gives rise to a claim under this Section accompanied by a certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section (provided that such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or pricing information or any other information prohibited to be disclosed by applicable law), which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.

  (a)  Payments Free of Taxes  .  Any and all payments by or on account of any  
  obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (i) the Borrower shall make such deductions or withholding, (ii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and (iii) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax, the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.  
  (b)  Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower  .  In addition, the Borrower shall  
  pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  
  (c)  Indemnification by the Borrower  .  The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for, and within 30 Business Days after written demand therefor, pay the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority, except for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or such Lender.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender,  
  
        41  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  
  (d)  Evidence of Payments  .  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  
  (e)  Foreign Lenders  .  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption  
  from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.  
  In addition, any Foreign Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the  
  Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Foreign Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  
  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is resident for tax  
  purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable:  
  (i)  duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or any successor form claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the  
  United States is a party,  
  (ii)  duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or any successor form certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States,  
  (iii)  in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (A) a certificate to the effect that such  
  Foreign Lender is not (1) a  bank  within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (3) a  controlled foreign corporation  described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (B) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue  
  
        42  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

Service Form W-8BEN-E (or any successor form) certifying that the Foreign Lender is not a United States Person, or  
  (iv)  any other form including Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY as applicable prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.  
  In addition, upon reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,  
  each Foreign Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the expiration or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Lender, provided it is legally able to do so at the time.  Each Foreign Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time the chief tax officer of such Foreign Lender becomes aware that it no longer satisfies the legal requirements to provide any previously delivered form or certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. or other taxing authorities for such purpose).  
           (f) 
    United States Lenders  .  Each Lender that is not a Foreign Lender shall  
     deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, upon the expiration or invalidity of any forms previously delivered and at times reasonably requested by the Borrower, duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any successor form.  
           (g) 
    FATCA  .  If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would  
     be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (g),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  
           (h) 
    Treatment of Certain Refunds  .  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender  
     determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund or credit (in lieu of such refund) of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-ofpocket  
  
        43  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

expenses of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, or any Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or any Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent, or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns or its books or records (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.  
           (i) 
    Survival  . Each party s obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive the  
     resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.  
    SECTION 2.17.         Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set- 
  offs  .  
           (a) 
    Payments by the Borrower  .  The Borrower shall make each payment  
     required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All amounts owing under this Agreement (including commitment fees, payments required under Section 2.14, and payments required under Section 2.15 relating to any Loan) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars.   
  
        44  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

(b) 
    Application of Insufficient Payments  .  If at any time insufficient funds are  
     received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.  
           (c) 
    Pro Rata Treatment  .  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:   
     (i) each Borrowing shall be made from the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.07 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (ii) each Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment of commitment fees under Section 2.10 shall be made for account of the  
  Lenders pro rata according to the average daily unused amounts of their respective  
  Commitments; (iv) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans held by them; and (v) each payment of interest on Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to such Lenders.  
           (d) 
    Sharing of Payments by Lenders  .  If any Lender shall, by exercising any  
     right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans;   provided   that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  
  
        45  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

(e) 
    Presumptions of Payment  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have  
     received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the  
  Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including  
  the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.  
           (f) 
    Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent  .  If any Lender shall fail  
     to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.  
    SECTION 2.18.         Defaulting Lenders  .  
  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender  
  becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:  
  (a)  commitment fees pursuant to Section 2.10(a) shall cease to accrue on the  
  unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender; and  
  (b)  the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender, including as set forth in Section 9.02(b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the proviso following Section 9.02(b)(v)), shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.  
  In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a  
  Defaulting Lender, then such Lender shall no longer be deemed a Defaulting Lender and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the  
  Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

  #4841-8625-7971v16    

SECTION 2.19.         Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders  .  
           (a) 
    Designation of a Different Lending Office  .  If any Lender requests  
     compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any cost or expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.  
           (b) 
    Replacement of Lenders  .  If any Lender requests compensation under  
     Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with clause (a) above, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or is a non-consenting Lender (that the Borrower is permitted to replace as provided in Section 9.02(d)), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.14 and Section 2.16) and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);   provided   that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts, including, without limitation, any amounts under Section 2.15), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case of any assignment as a result of a non-consenting Lender (that the Borrower is permitted to replace as provided in Section 9.02(d)), the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  
           (c) 
    Defaulting Lender  .  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required  
     
        47  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05 or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the  
  Administrative Agent to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.  
    SECTION 2.20.         Extension of Maturity Date  .  
  (a)  Extension  .  The Borrower, upon providing written notice to the Administrative Agent no earlier than 90 days and no later than 30 days prior to July 31, 2020, shall have the right to extend the Maturity Date to July 31, 2021.    
  (b)  Conditions to Effectiveness of Extension  .  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  
  the extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall not be effective unless:  
  (i)  no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such extension and immediately after giving effect thereto;   
  (ii)  each of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and in each of the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (unless the relevant representation and warranty already contains a materiality qualifier, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the date of such extension after giving effect thereto, as though made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date); and   
  (iii)  the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders a non-refundable extension fee equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the Loans outstanding on such date.

  (ii)  subject to Section 7.04 of the Guarantee and Security Agreement, to cause any bank or securities intermediary (within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code) to enter into such arrangements with the Collateral Agent as shall be appropriate in order that the Collateral Agent has  control  over each bank account or securities account of the Obligors (other than Excluded Accounts (as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement)) and in that connection, the Borrower agrees to cause all cash and other proceeds of Portfolio Investments received by any Obligor to be promptly deposited into such an account (or otherwise delivered to, or registered in the name of, the Collateral Agent) and, until such deposit, delivery or registration such cash and other proceeds shall be held in trust by the Borrower for and as the property of the Collateral Agent and shall not be commingled with any other funds or property of such Obligor or other Person,  
  (iii)  [Reserved],  
  (iv)  [Reserved],  
  (v)  in the event that any Obligor is acting as an agent or administrative agent under any loan documents with respect to any Bank Loan that does not constitute all of the credit extended to the underlying borrower under the relevant underlying loan documents, ensure that all funds held by such Obligor in such capacity as agent or administrative agent is segregated from all other funds of such Obligor and clearly identified as being held in an agency capacity, and  
  (vi)  cause all credit or loan agreements, any notes and all assignment and assumption agreements relating to any Portfolio Investment constituting part of the  
  
        62  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

Collateral to be held by (x) the Collateral Agent or (y) the Custodian pursuant to the terms of the Custodian Agreement (or another custodian reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent), or pursuant to an appropriate intercreditor agreement, so long as the Custodian (or custodian) has agreed to grant access to such loan and other documents to the Administrative Agent pursuant to an access or similar agreement between the Borrower and such Custodian (or custodian) in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; provided that the Borrower s obligation to deliver underlying documentation may be satisfied by delivery of copies of such agreements.  
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any instrument, promissory note, agreement, document or certificate held by the Custodian is destroyed or lost not as a result of any action of the Borrower, then any original of such instrument, promissory note, agreement, document or certificate shall be deemed held by the Custodian for all purposes hereunder,   provided   that, when the Borrower has actual knowledge of any such destroyed or lost instrument, promissory note, agreement, document or certificate, it uses all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the underlying borrower, and deliver to the Custodian, a replacement instrument, promissory note, agreement, document or certificate.  
    
    SECTION 5.09.         Use of Proceeds  .  The Borrower will use the proceeds of  
  the Loans only for general corporate purposes of the Borrower in the ordinary course of business, including making distributions not prohibited by the Loan Documents and the acquisition and funding (either directly or through one or more wholly-owned Subsidiary Guarantors) of Portfolio Investments; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any responsibility as to the use of any of such proceeds.  No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used in violation of applicable law or, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying any Margin Stock.  Margin Stock shall be purchased by the Obligors only with the proceeds of Indebtedness not directly or indirectly secured by Margin Stock (within the meaning of Regulation U), or with the proceeds of equity capital of the Borrower.  The Borrower will not request any Borrowing, and the Borrower shall not use, and shall procure that the Obligors and its or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall not use, the proceeds of any Borrowing (A) in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment or giving of money, or anything else of value, to any Person in violation of any Anti-Corruption Laws, (B) for the purpose of funding, financing or facilitating any activities, business or transaction of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any Sanctioned Country, or (C)  in any manner that would result in the violation of any Sanctions applicable to any party hereto.  
  SECTION 5.10.     Exemption from Registration under Investment Company     Act  .  The Borrower shall maintain its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.  
    SECTION 5.11.         Investment and Valuation Policies  .  The Borrower shall  
  
        63  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

promptly advise the Lenders and the Administrative Agent of any material change in either its Investment Policies or Valuation Policy.  
    SECTION 5.12.         Portfolio Valuation and Diversification, Etc  .  
           (a) 
    Industry Classification Groups  .  For purposes of this Agreement, the  
     Borrower, in its reasonable determination, shall assign each Portfolio Investment to an Industry Classification Group.  To the extent that any such Portfolio Investment is not correlated with the risks of other Portfolio Investments in an Industry Classification Group established by Moody s, such Portfolio Investment may be assigned by the Borrower to an Industry Classification Group that is more closely correlated to such Portfolio Investment.  In the absence of any correlation, the Borrower shall be permitted, upon notice to the Administrative Agent for distribution to each Lender to create up to three additional industry classification groups for purposes of this Agreement.  
           (b) 
    Portfolio Valuation, Etc  .  
     (i)  Settlement Date Basis  .  For purposes of this Agreement, all determinations of whether an investment is to be included as a Portfolio Investment shall be determined on a settlement-date basis (meaning that any investment that has been purchased will not be treated as a Portfolio Investment until such purchase has settled, and any Portfolio Investment which has been sold will not be excluded as a Portfolio Investment until such sale has settled),   provided   that no such investment shall be included as a Portfolio Investment to the extent it has not been paid for in full.  
  (ii)  Determination of Values  .  The Borrower will conduct reviews of the value to be assigned to each of its Portfolio Investments as follows:  
  (A)         Quoted Investments External Review  .  With respect to Portfolio Investments (including Cash Equivalents) for which market quotations are readily available (   Quoted Investments   ), the Borrower shall, not less frequently than once each calendar week, determine the market value of such Portfolio Investments which shall, in each case, be determined in accordance with one of the following methodologies (as selected by the Borrower):  
  (w)  in the case of public and 144A securities, the average of the bid prices as determined by two Approved Dealers selected by the  
  Borrower,  
  (x)  in the case of bank loans, the average of the bid prices as determined by two Approved Dealers selected by the Borrower or an Approved Pricing Service which makes reference to at least two Approved  
  Dealers with respect to such bank loans,  
  
        64  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

(y)  in the case of any Quoted Investment traded on an exchange, the closing price for such Portfolio Investment most recently posted on such exchange, and  
  (z)  in the case of any other Quoted Investment, the fair market value thereof as determined by an Approved Pricing Service.  
  (B)        Unquoted Investments External Review  .  With respect to  
  Portfolio Investments for which market quotations are not readily available (   Unquoted Investments   ), the Borrower shall value such Unquoted Investments quarterly in a manner consistent with its  Valuation Policy , as the same may be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified from time to time consistent with standard industry practice and in a manner not prohibited by this Agreement (the    Valuation Policy   ), including valuation of at least 35% by value of all Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base using the assistance of an Approved Third Party Appraiser;   provided   that each Unquoted Investment shall be so valued at least once per annum.  
  (C)        Internal Review  .  The Borrower shall conduct an internal review of the aggregate value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base, and of the Borrowing Base, at least once each calendar week which shall take into account any events of which the Borrower has knowledge that materially adversely affects the aggregate value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base or the Borrowing Base.  If, based upon such weekly internal review, the Borrower determines that a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, then the Borrower shall, within five Business Days as provided in Section 5.01(c), deliver a Borrowing Base Certificate reflecting the new amount of the Borrowing Base and shall take the actions, and make the payments and prepayments, all as more specifically set forth in Section 2.09(c).  
  (D)        Failure to Determine Values  .  If the Borrower shall fail to determine the value of any Portfolio Investment as at any date pursuant to the requirements of the foregoing sub-clauses (A) through (C), the  Value  of such Portfolio Investment as at such date shall be deemed to be zero.  
  (iii)  Scheduled Testing of Values  .  
  (A)  Each February 28, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each calendar year, commencing on April 30, 2016 (or such other dates as are agreed to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, but in no event less frequently than once per calendar quarter, each a    Valuation Testing Date   ), the Administrative Agent through an Independent Valuation Provider will test the values determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) above of those Portfolio  
  
        65  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

Investments included in the Borrowing Base selected by the Administrative Agent; provided, that the aggregate fair value of such Portfolio Investments tested on any Valuation Testing Date will be equal to the Tested Amount (as defined below) (or as near thereto as reasonably practical).  For the avoidance of doubt, Portfolio Investments that are part of the Collateral but not included in the  
  Borrowing Base shall not be subject to testing under this Section 5.12(b)(iii).  
  (B)  For purposes of this Agreement, the  Tested Amount  shall be equal to approximately 25% of the aggregate value of all Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base (as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date).  
  (C)  With respect to any Portfolio Investment, if the value of such Portfolio Investment determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is not more than the lesser of (1) five (5) points more than the midpoint of the valuation range (expressed as a percent of par) provided by the Independent Valuation Provider (provided that the value of such Portfolio Investment is customarily quoted as a percentage of par) and (2) 110% of the midpoint of the valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider, then the value for such Portfolio Investment determined in accordance with Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall be continue to be used as the  Value  for purposes of this Agreement.  If the value of any Portfolio Investment determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is more than the lesser of the values set forth in clause (C)(1) and (2) (to the extent applicable), then for such Portfolio Investment, the  Value  for purposes of this Agreement shall become the lesser of (x) the highest value of the valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider, (y) five (5) points more than the midpoint of the valuation range (expressed as a percent of par) provided by the Independent Valuation Provider (provided that the value of such Portfolio Investment is customarily quoted as a percentage of par) and (z) 110% of the midpoint of the valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider.  For the avoidance of doubt, any values determined by the Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(iii) or Section 5.12(b)(iv) shall be used solely for purposes of determining the  Value  of a Portfolio Investment under this Agreement and shall not be deemed to be the fair value of such asset as required under ASC 820, for purposes of the Borrower s financial statements and the Investment Company Act.  
    (iv)         Supplemental Testing of Values  .  
  (A)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, individually or at the request of the Required Lenders, shall at any time have the right to request, in its reasonable discretion, any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base with a value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) to be  
  
        66  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

independently tested by the Independent Valuation Provider.  There shall be no limit on the number of such tests that may be requested by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion;   provided   that, all such tests shall be conducted in such a manner not disruptive in any material respect to the business of the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of its receipt of the final results of any such test promptly upon its receipt thereof and shall provide a copy of such results and the related report to (i) the Borrower promptly upon receipt and (ii) any Lender upon such Lender s request;   provided   that such Lender, if required, has entered into an agreement with the Independent Valuation Provider governing the use of the information contained in such report.  If (x) the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is less than the value determined by the Independent Valuation Provider, then the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall continue to be used as the  Value  for purposes of this Agreement and (y) if the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is greater than the value determined by the Independent Valuation Provider and the difference between such values is:  (1) less than 5% of the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall continue to be used as the  Value  for purposes of this Agreement; (2) between 5% and 20% of the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the  Value  of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement shall become the average of the value determined pursuant to  
  Section 5.12(b)(ii) and the value determined by such Independent Valuation  
  Provider; and (3) greater than 20% of the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall retain an additional third-party appraiser and the  Value  of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement shall become the average of the three valuations (with the Independent Valuation Provider s value to be used as the  Value  until the third value is obtained).  For the avoidance of doubt, Portfolio Investments that are part of the Collateral but which the Borrower has not expressly included in the Borrowing Base shall not be subject to testing under this Section 5.12(b)(iv).  
  (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Value of any Portfolio  
  Investment for which the Independent Valuation Provider s value is used shall be the midpoint of the range (if any) determined by the Independent Valuation Provider.  The Independent Valuation Provider shall apply a recognized valuation methodology that is commonly accepted by the business development company industry for valuing Portfolio Investments of the type being valued and held by the Obligors.  
  (C)  All valuations shall be on a settlement date basis.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Value of any Portfolio Investment determined in  
  
        67  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

accordance with this Section 5.12 shall be the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement until a new Value for such Portfolio Investment is subsequently determined (or required to be determined) in good faith in accordance with this Section 5.12.  
  (D)  The reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of any valuation reasonably incurred by the Administrative Agent under this Section 5.12 shall be at the expense of the Borrower.  
  (E)  In addition, the values determined by the Independent Valuation  
  Provider shall be deemed to be  Information  hereunder and subject to Section 9.13 hereof.  
    SECTION 5.13.         Calculation of Borrowing Base  .  For purposes of this  
  Agreement, the  Borrowing Base  shall be determined, as at any date of determination, as the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (x) the Value of each Portfolio Investment by (y) the applicable Advance Rate, provided that:  
  (a)  the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments issued by one or more members of any one consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 7.5% and less than 12.5% of the aggregate Value of all Unadjusted Eligible Portfolio Investments, shall be  
  50% of the otherwise applicable Advance Rate;  
  (b)  the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments issued by one or more members of any one consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 12.5% of the aggregate Value of all Unadjusted Eligible Portfolio Investments shall be 0%;  
  (c)  the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments in (i) the largest Industry Classification Group that exceeds 20% of the aggregate Value of all Unadjusted Eligible Portfolio Investments and (ii) any other Industry Classification Group that exceeds 15% of the aggregate Value of all Unadjusted  
  Eligible Portfolio Investments shall, in each case be 0%;  
  (d)  the Advance Rate applicable to CDO Securities (including collateralized loan obligations or other investments that similarly represent an investment in underlying levered portfolios), finance leases, joint ventures, investment funds and any other investment type not listed in the definition of  Advance Rate  below, shall be 0%;  
  (e)  the aggregate Borrowing Base contribution of the Borrower s investments in Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term U.S. Government Securities, Performing First Lien Bank Loans, Second Out Portions of Performing Unitranche Bank Loans and  
  Performing Second Lien Bank Loans may not be less than 80% of the Borrowing Base;  
  
        68  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

(f)  the aggregate Borrowing Base contribution of the Borrower s investments in Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term U.S. Government Securities and Performing First Lien Bank Loans (collectively, the    Aggregate First Lien Contribution   ) may not be less than (i) 40% of the Borrowing Base if the Obligors have in aggregate 15 or more Portfolio Investments, (ii) 45% of the Borrowing Base if the Obligors have in aggregate  
  12 or more but less than 15 Portfolio Investments, (iii) 50% of the Borrowing Base if the  
  Obligors have 10 or more but less than 12 Portfolio Investments, and (iv) 55% of the  
  Borrowing Base if the Obligors have 8 or more but less than 10 Portfolio Investments;   
  (g)  (i) during the period from the Restatement Effective Date to and including the Commitment Termination Date, the Borrowing Base shall at all times include at least 12 individual Portfolio Investments and (ii) during the period after the Commitment Termination Date to the Maturity Date, the Borrowing Base shall at all times include at least 8 individual Portfolio Investments;  
  (h)  Following the application of (a) through (g) above, if at any time the weighted average maturity of all Portfolio Investments (based on the Value of Portfolio  
  Investments to the extent included in the Borrowing Base) exceeds six (6) years, the Borrower shall specify which Portfolio Investments shall be removed from the calculation of the Borrowing Base (but not from the Collateral) such that the weighted average maturity of all Portfolio Investments included in the calculation of the Borrowing Base is no greater than 6 years (subject to all other constraints, limitations and restrictions set forth herein); and  
  (i)  no Portfolio Investment may be included in the Borrowing Base until such time as such Portfolio Investment has been Delivered (as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) to the Collateral Agent, and then only for so long as such Portfolio Investment continues to be Delivered as contemplated therein; provided that in the case of any Portfolio Investment in which the Collateral Agent has a first-priority perfected security interest pursuant to a valid Uniform Commercial Code filing (and for which no other method of perfection with a higher priority is possible), such Portfolio Investment may be included in the Borrowing Base so long as all remaining actions to complete  Delivery  are satisfied within 7 days of such inclusion.  
  For the avoidance of doubt, to avoid double-counting of excess concentrations,  
  any Advance Rate reductions set forth under this Section 5.13 shall be without duplication of any other such Advance Rate reductions.  
  As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:  
     Advance Rate    means, as to any Portfolio Investment and subject to adjustment  
  as provided in Section 5.13(a) through (g), (i) in the event that (A) the Obligors have in  
  
        69  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

aggregate 15 or more Portfolio Investments and (B) the Aggregate First Lien Contribution is greater than or equal to 50% of the Borrowing Base, the applicable percentage as set forth in Table I below with respect to such Portfolio Investment, and (ii) in all other instances, the applicable percentage with respect to such Portfolio Investment as set forth in Table II below:

  ARTICLE VIII  
    
  THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT    
  Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its  
  agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the  
  Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  
  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same  
  rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.  
  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those  
  expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied  
  
        88  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required  
  Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.  
  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any  
  liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  
  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its  
  rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  
  
        89  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and  
  the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing in consultation with the Borrower), to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation shall nonetheless become effective except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative  
  Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.  
  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon  
  the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  
  Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02(b) with respect to this Agreement,  
  the Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Loan Documents,   provided   that, without the prior consent of each Lender, the Administrative Agent shall not (except as provided herein or in the Security Documents) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under any Security Document providing for collateral security, agree to additional obligations being secured by all or substantially all of such collateral security, alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the benefits of the Liens created under the Security Documents with respect to all or  
  
        90  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

substantially all of the Collateral, except that no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to (1) release any Lien covering property that is the subject of either a disposition of property permitted hereunder or a disposition to which the Required Lenders have consented, and (2) spread any Liens to any Hedging Agreement Obligations (as such term is defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) in accordance with the Guarantee and Security Agreement.

    SECTION 9.02.         Waivers; Amendments  .  
  (a)  No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative  .  No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Obligor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the

    Amendments to Security Documents  .  No Security Document nor any  
     provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified, nor may the Liens thereof be spread to secure any additional obligations (excluding the spreading of such Liens to any Hedging Agreement Obligations (as such term is defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) as provided for in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower, and by the Collateral Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;   provided   that, except as otherwise expressly permitted by the Loan Documents, (i) without the written consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the Obligors from their respective obligations under the Security Documents and (ii) without the written consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the collateral security or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under the Security Documents, alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the Liens created under the Security Documents (except in connection with securing additional obligations equally and ratably with the Loans and other obligations hereunder) with respect to all or substantially all of the collateral security provided thereby, or release all or substantially all of the guarantors under the Guarantee and Security Agreement from their guarantee obligations thereunder, except that no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized (and so agrees with the Borrower) to direct the Collateral Agent under the Guarantee and Security Agreement to, and in addition to the rights of such parties under the Guarantee and Security Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent under the Guarantee and Security Agreement may (in addition to the rights of such parties under the Guarantee and Security Agreement), release any Lien covering property (and to release any such guarantor) that is the subject of either a disposition of property permitted hereunder or a disposition to which the Required Lenders have consented.

  #4841-8625-7971v16    

modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender,   provided   such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(d) as though it were a Lender hereunder.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Commitments or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the    Participant Register    provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  
  (f)  Limitations on Rights of Participants  .  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender and in the case of a Participant claiming exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, the applicable Lender shall provide the Borrower with satisfactory evidence that the participation is in registered form and shall permit the Borrower to review such register as reasonably needed for the Borrower to comply with its obligations under applicable laws and regulations.  
  (g)  Certain Pledges  .  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security  
  interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;   provided   that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  
  (h)  No Assignments to Natural Persons or the Borrower or its Affiliates or     Subsidiaries  .  Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or  
  
        99  
  #4841-8625-7971v16    

participate any interest in any Loan held by it hereunder to (i) any natural person or (ii) the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

  warranties made by the any Obligor herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.  The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

  and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in any currency) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured, or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such Indebtedness.  The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
