Note
1 - Organization, Business of the Company and Liquidity   

Organization
and Nature of Operations   

ICTV
Brands Inc., (the  Company  or  ICTV ), was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on September
25, 1998. The Company together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Better Blocks International Limited ( BBI ), a New
Zealand corporation, sells various health, wellness and beauty products as well as miscellaneous consumer products through a number
of sales channels throughout the United States and internationally. Although our companies are incorporated in Nevada and New
Zealand, our operations are currently run from the Wayne, Pennsylvania office.  

The
Company develops, markets and sells products through a multi-channel distribution strategy, including direct response television,
digital marketing campaigns, live home shopping, traditional retail and e-commerce market places, and our international third
party distributor network. We offer primarily health, beauty and wellness products as well as various consumer products, including
DermaWand TM , a skin care device that reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and helps improve skin tone
and texture, DermaVital   , a professional quality skin care line that effects superior hydration, the CoralActives    brand
of acne treatment and skin cleansing products, Derma Brilliance   , a skin care resurfacing device that helps reduce
visible signs of aging, Jidue TM , a facial massager device which helps alleviate stress, and Good Planet Super Solution TM ,
a multi-use cleaning agent. We acquire the rights to our products that we market primarily via licensing agreements, acquisition
and in-house development and sell both domestically and internationally. The Company is presently exploring other devices and
consumable product lines currently under licensing agreements.  

The
goal of our strategy is to use the brand awareness we create in our marketing campaigns so that we can sell the products, along
with related families of products, under distinct brand names through multiple sales channels including direct response television
( DRTV ), digital marketing channels, live home shopping, traditional retail and e-commerce marketplaces, and our
third party international distributor network.  

Note
2 - Summary of significant accounting policies   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
for interim financial statements and with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to interim financial
statements and therefore do not include all disclosures that might normally be required for financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared by management without audit and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the
notes thereto, appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations
and consolidated cash flows, for the periods indicated, have been made. The results of operations for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of operating results that may be achieved over the course of the full year.  

Principles
of consolidation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
BBI. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Note
2 - Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)   

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( US GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing its condensed
consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent. The most significant estimates used in these condensed consolidated
financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for returns, inventory reserves, valuation allowance
on deferred tax assets and share based compensation. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
August 2016, Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,( ASU 2016-15 ).
 The updated accounting requirement is intended to reduce diversity in practice in the classification of certain transactions
in the statement of cash flows. Such transactions include but are not limited to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs,
settlement of zero coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and distributions
received from equity method of investments. ASU 2016-15 is required to be retrospectively applied and is effective for fiscal
years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adaption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the new guidance to the consolidated financial statements.  

In
June 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which
sets forth the current expected credit loss model, a new forward-looking impairment model for certain financial instruments based
on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,
2019, and early adoption of the standard is permitted. Entities are required to adopt ASU No. 2016-13 using a modified retrospective
approach, subject to certain limited exceptions. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated
financial statements.  

In
March 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ) which simplifies several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements,
as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The methods of adoption are dependent on the specific aspects of the
new guidance adopted. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted but the Company must adopt all amendments that apply in the same period
if they choose to adopt early. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance to the consolidated financial
statements.  

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  Leases (Topic 842) , ( ASU 2016-02 ). This standard requires
entities that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created
by those leases. The standard is effective for fiscal years and the interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018. The guidance is required to be applied by the modified retrospective transition approach. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance to the consolidated financial statements.  

In
November 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,   which
simplifies current guidance and requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance
sheet. ASU 2015-17 can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and is effective for periods beginning after December
15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company believes the effect of this guidance will not be material to its consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.

  SEPTEMBER

  (Unaudited)  

Note
2 - Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)   

In
July 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11- Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which provides that
an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal,
and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The
amendments in this update are effective for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.  

In
May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on revenue recognition. The new standard provides
for a single five-step model to be applied to all revenue contracts with customers as well as requires additional financial statement
disclosures that will enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating
to customer contracts. Companies have an option to use either a retrospective approach or cumulative effect adjustment approach
to implement the standard. Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective
date of the standard. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.  

Concentration
of credit risk   

Financial
instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, include cash and trade receivables. The Company
maintains cash in bank accounts that, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses
and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts.  

As
of September 30, 2016, 64% of the Company s accounts receivable were due from various individual customers to whom our products
had been sold directly via Direct Response Television. In addition, 21% of the Company s accounts receivable was cash due
from retail and e-commerce customers and 3% of the Company s accounts receivable was cash due from the Company s credit
card processors as of September 30, 2016. Major customers are considered to be those who accounted for more than 10% of net sales.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were 10% and 0%, respectively, of net sales made to one e-commerce
customer as compared to no major customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Fair
value of financial instruments   

Fair
value estimates, assumptions and methods used to estimate fair value of the Company s financial instruments are made in
accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 825-10,  Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments.  The Company has used available information to derive its estimates. However, because these
estimates are made as of a specific point in time, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize currently.
The use of different assumptions or estimating methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The carrying
values of financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities
approximate their fair values due to the short settlement period for these instruments.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

The
Company considers all unrestricted highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  

Foreign
currency transactions   

Transactions
entered into by the Company in currencies other than its local currency, are recorded in its local currency and any changes in
currency exchange rates that occur from the initiation of a transaction until settled are recorded as foreign currency gains or
losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September
30, 2016 and 2015  

  (Unaudited)  

Note
2 - Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)   

Accounts
receivable   

Accounts
receivable are recorded net of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts of approximately $135,000 at September 30, 2016 and
$119,000 at December 31, 2015. The allowances are estimated based on customer returns and bad debts. In addition to reserves for
returns on accounts receivable, an accrual is made for the return of product that has been sold to customers and had cash collections,
while the customer still has the right to return the product. The amounts of these accruals included in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were approximately $89,000 and $80,000 at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively.  

Inventories   

Inventories
consist primarily of products held for resale, and are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. The
Company adjusts inventory for estimated obsolescence when necessary based upon demand and market conditions. The Company s
reserve for obsolescence was approximately $103,000 and $123,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Included
in inventory at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is approximately $64,000 and $42,000, respectively, of consigned product
that has been shipped to customers under the 30-day free trial period for which the trial period has not expired and as such the
customer has not accepted the product as well as consigned products that are held at a retailer distributor for sale.  

Furniture
and equipment   

Furniture
and equipment are carried at cost and depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets ranging
from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. The related cost and accumulated depreciation of assets
retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and the resultant gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed currently while major renewals and betterments are capitalized.  

Depreciation
expense amounted to approximately $2,000 and $6,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Impairment
of long-lived assets   

In
accordance with ASC 360-10,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  long-lived assets are
reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows estimated
by the Company to be generated by such assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of by sale are
recorded as held for sale at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value. No impairment losses were identified
or recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Related
party transactions   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had one sale of approximately $14,000 with an international third party
distributor affiliated with one of our Board of Director members. The pricing and terms of the sale are similar to other international
third party sales.  

Revenue
recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenues from product sales when the following four criteria have been met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.
The Company s revenues in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations are net of sales taxes. Revenues from product
sales are recorded net of provisions for estimated chargebacks, rebates, expected returns and cash discounts.

  September

  (Unaudited)  

Note
2 - Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)   

The
Company offers a 30-day risk-free trial as one of its payment options. Revenue on the 30-day risk-free trial sales is not recognized
until customer acceptance and collectability are assured which we determine to be when the trial period ends. If the risk-free
trial expires without action by the customer, product is determined to be accepted by the customer and revenue is recorded. Revenue
for items purchased without the 30-day free trial is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer and collectability
is reasonably assured.  

Revenue
related to our DermaVital TM  continuity program is recognized monthly upon shipment to customers. Revenue from our live
home shopping and retail customers is recorded upon sale to the final customer. Revenue related to international wholesale customers
is recorded at gross amounts with a corresponding charge to cost of sales upon shipment.  

The
Company had international third party distributor sales and retail sales of approximately $388,000 and $221,000 as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, included in deferred revenue   short-term on the accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheets for payments received prior to shipment.  

The
Company has a return policy whereby the customer can return any product received within 30 days of receipt for a full refund.
The Company provides a provision for product returns based on the experience with historical sales returns, in accordance with
ASC Topic 605-15 with respect to sales of product when a right of return exists. Returns for the periods presented have been offset
against gross sales. Such allowance for sales returns is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  

The
Company sells warranties on the DermaWand TM  for various terms. Revenue is recognized ratably over the term, with the
unearned warranty included in deferred revenue on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the Company s
deferred service revenue related to the warranties is presented in the following table:  

Shipping
and handling   

The
amount billed to customers for shipping and handling is included in revenue. Shipping, handling and processing revenue approximated
$571,000 and $1,633,000 and $489,000 and $2,593,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs approximated $232,000 and $659,000 and
$284,000 and $1,476,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Research
and development   

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and marketing expense in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statements of operations. Research and development costs primarily consist of efforts to discover and develop new
products, including clinical trials, product safety testing, certifications for international regulations and standards, etc.
Product testing and development costs approximated $31,000 and $88,000 and $26,000 and $90,000 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Media
and production costs   

Media
and internet marketing costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and marketing expense in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statements of operations. Production costs associated with the creation of new and updated infomercials and advertising
campaigns are expensed at the commencement of a campaign. The Company incurred approximately $1,444,000 and $1,206,000 in media
costs for airing its infomercials, $7,000 and $85,000 in new production costs, and $299,000 and $146,000 in internet marketing
costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and approximately $4,011,000 and $6,519,000 in media
costs for airing its infomercials, $210,000 and $293,000 in new production costs, and $899,000 and $462,000 in internet
marketing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Income
taxes   

In
preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we make estimates of our current tax exposure and temporary differences
resulting from timing differences for reporting items for book and tax purposes. We recognize deferred taxes by the asset and
liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for
the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In addition, valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. In consideration of our accumulated losses and limited historical
ability to generate taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets, we have estimated that we will not be able to realize any
benefit from our temporary differences and have recorded a full valuation allowance. If we sustain profitability in the future
at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net
operating loss carry-forward, we would record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would
then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates. Subsequent revisions to the estimated
net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to
period.  

Stock
options   

In
June 2001, our shareholders approved our 2001 Stock Option Plan (the  Plan ). The Plan is designed for selected employees,
officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiary, and is intended to advance the best interests of the Company by providing
personnel who have substantial responsibility for the management and growth of the Company and its subsidiary with additional
incentive by increasing their proprietary interest in the success of the Company, thereby encouraging them to remain in the employ
of the Company or its subsidiary. The Plan is administered by the Board of Directors of the Company, and authorizes the issuance
of stock options not to exceed a total of 3,000,000 shares. The terms of any awards under the Plan are determined by the Board
of Directors, provided that no options may be granted at less than the fair market value of the stock as of the date of the grant.
The Plan expired in February 2011. As of September 30, 2016, 116,667 options are outstanding under the Plan.  

In
December 2011, our shareholders approved our 2011 Stock Option Plan (the  2011 Plan ). The 2011 Plan is designed for
selected employees, officers, and directors of the Company and its subsidiary, and is intended to advance the best interests of
the Company by providing personnel who have substantial responsibility for the management and growth of the Company and its subsidiary
with additional incentive by increasing their proprietary interest in the success of the Company, thereby encouraging them to
remain in the employ of the Company or its subsidiary. The 2011 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors of the Company,
and authorizes the issuance of stock options not to exceed a total of 6,000,000 shares. The terms of any awards under the Plan
are determined by the Board of Directors, provided that no options may be granted at less than the fair market value of the stock
as of the date of the grant. Generally, the options granted vest over three years with one-third vesting on each anniversary date
of the grant. As of September 30, 2016, 3,138,335 options are outstanding under the 2011 Plan.

Stock
options (continued)   

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 505, subtopic 50,
 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees  based upon the fair-value of the underlying instrument. The equity instruments,
consisting of stock options granted to consultants, are valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The measurement of share-based
compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest and is recognized as an expense over
the period which services are received. Nonvested stock options granted to non-employees are remeasured at each reporting period.  

The
Company uses ASC Topic 718,  Share-Based Payments  to account for share-based compensation issued to employees and
directors. The Company recognizes compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments such as stock
options granted to employees over the requisite vesting period of the awards.  

The
following is a summary of stock options outstanding under the Plan and 2011 Plan (collectively  Stock Option Plans )
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Of
the stock options outstanding as of September 30, 2016 under the Stock Option Plans, 2,318,334 options are currently vested and
exercisable. The weighted average exercise price of these options was $0.21. These options expire through December 2025. The aggregate
intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $12,000 and $349,000,
respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately
$31,000.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded approximately $42,000 and $218,000 and $138,000
and $416,000, respectively in share based compensation expense related to vesting of options previously granted under the Stock
Option Plans. At September 30, 2016, there was approximately $322,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
option grants that will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 3 years.  

There
were no grants for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Note
5 - Other assets and liabilities   

On
January 22, 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Omega 5 Technologies, Inc. to acquire the worldwide ownership
of the DermaWand patent and all related trademarks and intellectual property for the sum of $1,200,000 to be paid out as follows:
$300,000 per year for calendar years 2016 through 2019, payable in uniform quarterly installments on or before the last day of
each calendar quarter. As a result, effective January 1, 2016, the Company is no longer obligated to make royalty payments on
sales of DermaWand TM . There shall be no interest charged, and ICTV may, in its sole discretion, at any time without
permission or penalty pre-pay some or all of the purchase price.  Under our old licensing
agreement, ICTV had been assigned the patents, related trademarks, and exclusive commercial rights to DermaWand based upon
a $2.50 per unit fee and maintaining annual minimum royalty requirements.   

As
a result of the agreement, the Company recorded an offsetting asset and liability at January 1, 2016 in the amount of $1,200,000
for the asset from the intellectual property acquired and a corresponding liability per the payment schedule. As there is no interest
charged with the purchase agreement the Company recorded a discount for imputed interest of approximately $37,000, calculated
based on the applicable federal rates at January 2016 of 1.45%, which will be amortized over the term of the agreement using the
effective interest method. The other asset balance for the patent and trademark will be amortized using the straight-line method
over the four-year period of the agreement, which at this time is management s best estimate of the remaining useful life.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the other liability balance was approximately $951,000, including the discount for imputed interest of
approximately $24,000, of which approximately $288,000 was current. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we
amortized approximately $4,000 and $12,000 of interest expense related to the discount for imputed interest. The other asset balance
was approximately $946,000 as of September 30, 2016 with amortization of approximately $73,000 and $218,000 being recorded in
cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The accumulated amortization was approximately $218,000
as of September 30, 2016. There was approximately $103,000 and $591,000 in royalty expense for DermaWand for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Management evaluates the other asset for impairment when there is a triggering event and concluded
there was no such event as of September 30, 2016.

On
July 2, 2014, the Company entered into a $500,000, one-year Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A with an expiration date
of July 2, 2015. Interest on the Credit Facility was calculated using the Adjusted One Month LIBOR Rate plus 2.50%. The facility
was collateralized by a lien on the Company s assets and required the Company to maintain prescribed levels of liquidity
and EBITDA. Effective November 7, 2014, the Credit Facility was amended to remove the EBITDA covenant and hold $500,000 as cash
collateral for the amount of the line of credit. The Company did not utilize the Credit Facility. Effective February 18, 2015,
the Company terminated the Credit Facility and the $500,000 collateral held in escrow was released.  

Note
7 - Basic and diluted earnings per share   

ASC
260,  Earnings Per Share  requires presentation of basic earnings per share and dilutive earnings per share.  

The
computation of basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share gives the effect to all dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise or contingent
exercise of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect. At September 30, 2016, there were no warrants outstanding and
exercisable. At September 30, 2016, there were 5,448,336 stock options outstanding and 4,370,001 were vested and exercisable at
an average exercise price of $0.28.  

All
outstanding securities were anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as a result of a net
loss for all periods. The following securities were not involved in the computation of diluted net loss per share as their effect
would have been anti-dilutive:  

The
computations for basic and fully diluted earnings per share are as follows:

8 - Income taxes   

The
provision for income taxes is $0 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The effective tax rates
reflect provisions for current federal and state income taxes. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $2,479,000
of gross federal net operating losses and $874,000 of gross state net operating losses available. The Company has completed an
IRC Section 382 study and concluded that the availability of the Company s net operating loss carry forwards will not be
subject to annual limitations against taxable income in future periods due to change in ownership rules as of September 30, 2016.
The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on its net deferred asset as the Company does not have sufficient history
of taxable income. The Company does not believe it has any material uncertain tax positions. The Company s policy is to
recognize interest and penalties related to tax matters in general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Operations. The Company recorded zero interest and penalties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Note
9 - Segment reporting   

The
Company operates in one industry segment and is engaged in the selling of various consumer products primarily through direct marketing
channels. The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure
is operating income (loss) by the end customer, either direct to consumer DRTV sales or wholesale international third party distributor
sales. Operating expenses are primarily prorated based on the relationship between DRTV consumer sales and international third
party distributor sales

Asset Purchase Agreement   

On
October 4, 2016, the Company and its newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, ICTV Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation ( ICTV
Holdings ), entered into an asset purchase agreement (the  PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement ) with PhotoMedex,
Inc., a Nevada corporation ( PhotoMedex ), and its subsidiaries, Radiancy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, PhotoTherapeutics
Ltd., a private limited company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and Radiancy (Israel) Limited,
a private corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel (collectively, the  Sellers ), pursuant to
which ICTV Holdings has agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of the Sellers, including, but not limited to, all of
the equity interests of Radiancy (HK) Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong, and LK Technology
Importa  o E Exporta  o LTDA, a private Sociedade limitada formed under the laws of Brazil (collectively,
the  PhotoMedex Target Business ), for a total purchase price of $9,500,000. Such acquisition is referred to herein
as the  PhotoMedex Acquisition.  The PhotoMedex Acquisition includes the acquisition from the Sellers of proprietary
products and services that address skin diseases and conditions or pain reduction using home-use devices for various indications
including hair removal, acne treatment, skin rejuvenation, and lower back pain; which products are sold and distributed to traditional
retail, online and infomercial outlets for home-use products and include, without limitation, the following: (a) no!no! Hair,
(b) no!no! Skin, (c) no!no! Face Trainer, (d) no!no! Glow, (e) Made Ya Look, (f) no!no! Smooth Skin Care, (g) Kryobak, and (h)
ClearTouch (the  Consumer Products ).  

The
purchase price to be paid by ICTV Holdings in the PhotoMedex Acquisition, for which the Company is also jointly and severally
liable, is payable as follows: (i) $3,000,000 of the purchase price was deposited on October 5, 2016 into an escrow account established
by counsel to the Company and ICTV Holdings, as escrow agent (the  Escrow Agent ), under an escrow agreement entered
into on October 4, 2016 among the Company, ICTV Holdings, the Sellers, the Escrow Agent, and certain investors in Company s
private placement described in more detail below (the  Escrow Agreement ), which escrow funds will be paid to the
Sellers at the closing of the PhotoMedex Acquisition (the  PhotoMedex Closing ) in accordance with the Escrow Agreement
and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii) $2,000,000 of the purchase price shall be paid by ICTV Holdings to the Sellers on
or before the 90 th  day following the PhotoMedex Closing; and (iii) the remainder of the purchase price shall be payable
in the form of a continuing royalty as described in more detail below. On October 4, 2016, as required by the PhotoMedex Purchase
Agreement, the Company delivered to PhotoMedex a letter of credit from LeoGroup Private Debt Facility, L.P. ( LeoGroup ),
a private equity fund, that secures the Company s obligation to make the $2 million payment referred to in clause (ii) above.
The Company expects to fund the payment of the purchase price and expenses incurred in connection with the PhotoMedex Acquisition
through a combination of cash on hand and the private placement described below.  

Under
the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement, the Company and ICTV Holdings are required to pay to the Sellers a continuing monthly royalty
on net cash (invoiced amount less sales refunds, returns, rebates, allowances and similar items) actually received by ICTV Holdings
or its affiliates from sales of the Consumer Products. Such royalty payments commence with net cash actually received from and
after the PhotoMedex Closing and continue until the total royalty paid to Sellers totals $4,500,000, calculated as follows: (i)
35% of net cash from the sale of all Consumer Products sold through live television promotions made through Home Shopping Network
(HSN) in the United States, QVC in the European Union, and The Shopping Channel ( TSC ) in Canada, less
(a) deductions for sales commissions actually paid and on-air costs incurred for those amounts collected related to the sale of
Consumer Products made through HSN in the United States, QVC in the European Union, and TSC in Canada, and (b) the cost of goods
sold to generate such net cash; and (ii) 6% of net cash from the sale of all Consumer Products other than the foregoing sales.  

ICTV
Holdings will also assume certain liabilities and obligations of the Sellers relating to the PhotoMedex Target Business, including
contractual obligations, and various other liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating to the PhotoMedex Target Business
after the PhotoMedex Closing.

10   Subsequent Events (continued)   

The
PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, as well as indemnification provisions
subject to specified limitations. The indemnification provided by PhotoMedex under the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement covers
breaches of representations and warranties of the Sellers, breaches of covenants or other obligations of the Sellers, and liabilities
retained by the Sellers. The indemnification provided by the Company and ICTV Holdings covers breaches of representations
and warranties of the Company and ICTV Holdings, breaches of covenants or other obligations of the Company or ICTV Holdings, and
liabilities assumed by ICTV Holdings. In the case of the indemnification provided by PhotoMedex with respect to breaches
of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties, the obligations of PhotoMedex are subject to a cap on losses equal
to $2,250,000, and its liability for the other indemnification, including for breaches of fundamental representations and warranties
shall not exceed the purchase price actually received by the Sellers. In addition, in the case of the indemnification provided
by PhotoMedex with respect to breaches of certain representations and warranties, PhotoMedex will only become liable for indemnified
losses if the amount exceeds $100,000, whereupon PhotoMedex will only be liable for losses in excess of such $100,000 threshold.
The Company and ICTV Holdings have the ability to set off indemnity claims against future royalty payments owed to the Sellers
subject to following an administrative procedure outlined in the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement with respect to such set off claims
and the Company and ICTV Holdings must first set-off the amount of any indemnification claims against the royalty payments before
making a claim directly against PhotoMedex.  

The
closing of the PhotoMedex Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the completion
of accounting and legal due diligence investigations; the receipt of all authorizations, consents and approvals of all governmental
authorities or agencies; the receipt of any required consents of any third parties; the receipt of an opinion from counsel to
the Sellers; the release of any security interests on the PhotoMedex Target Business; delivery of all documents required for the
transfer of the acquired assets, including all intellectual property assignments and lease assignments; and the requisite approvals
of the stockholders of the Company and PhotoMedex.  

The
PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights that could be exercised by the parties. Either the Sellers,
on the one hand, or the Company or ICTV Holdings, on the other hand, may terminate the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement if the closing
has not occurred by February 1, 2017 if the conditions to closing have not been satisfied by such date, except that a party cannot
terminate the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement if the failure of the closing to occur is due to the failure of such party to perform
its covenants, agreements and conditions under the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement. In addition, either the Sellers, on the one
hand, or the Company or ICTV Holdings, on the other hand, may terminate the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement if there has been a
material misrepresentation or breach of covenant or agreement contained in the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement on the part of the
other party and such breach of a covenant or agreement has not been promptly cured after at least 14 day s written notice
is given.  

In
connection with the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement, on October 4, 2016, ICTV Holdings entered into a transition services agreement
with the Sellers (the  Transition Services Agreement ), pursuant to which Sellers have agreed to make available to
ICTV Holdings certain services on a transitional basis and allow ICTV Holdings to occupy and use a portion of the Sellers 
premises and warehouses, in exchange for which ICTV Holdings shall (i) pay to the Sellers the documented costs and expenses incurred
by them in connection with the provision of those services; (ii) pay to the Sellers the documented lease costs including monthly
rental and any utility charges incurred under the applicable leases; (iii) reimburse the Sellers for the documented costs and
expenses incurred by them for the continued storage of inventory and raw materials at warehouse locations, and for services for
fulfilling and shipping orders for such inventory; and (iv) reimburse the Sellers for the payroll, employment-related taxes, benefit
costs and out of pocket expenses paid to or on behalf of employees.  

Subject
to satisfaction of the conditions described above and assuming the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement is not terminated, the PhotoMedex
Acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 or early first quarter of 2017.

purchase price to be paid by the Company and the Purchaser in the Ermis Labs Acquisition is payable as follows: (i) $400,000 of
the purchase price shall be paid at the closing of the Ermis Labs Acquisition (the  Ermis Labs Closing ) through the
issuance of 2,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ),
to the shareholders of Ermis Labs, the value of which was based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the OTCQX on October
4, 2016, which was $0.16 per share; and (ii) the remainder of the purchase price shall be payable in the form of a continuing
royalty as described in more detail below. The issuance of the Common Stock pursuant to the Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement is being
made in reliance upon an exemption from registration provided under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the  Securities Act ).  

Under
the Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser is required to pay to Ermis Labs a continuing monthly royalty of 5% of net cash
(invoiced amount less sales refunds, returns, rebates, allowances and similar items) actually received by the Purchaser or its
affiliates from sales of the over-the-counter medicated skin care products acquired in the Ermis Labs Acquisition, commencing
with net cash actually received by the Purchaser or its affiliates from and after the Ermis Labs Closing and continuing until
the total royalty paid to Ermis Labs totals $1,750,000; provided, however, that the Purchaser is required to pay a minimum annual
royalty amount of $175,000 on or before December 31 of each year commencing with calendar year ending December 31, 2017.  

The
Purchaser will also assume certain liabilities and obligations of Ermis Labs relating to the Ermis Labs Target Business, including
contractual obligations, and various other liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating to the Ermis Labs Target Business
after the Ermis Labs Closing.  

The
Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, as well as indemnification provisions
subject to specified limitations. The indemnification provided by Ermis Labs and LeoGroup under the Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement
covers breaches of representations, warranties and covenants of Ermis Labs and LeoGroup, and liabilities retained by the Ermis
Labs. The indemnification provided by the Company and the Purchaser covers breaches of representations, warranties and covenants
of the Company and the Purchaser, and liabilities assumed by the Purchaser. In the case of the indemnification provided by
Ermis Labs and LeoGroup with respect to breaches of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties, Ermis Labs and LeoGroup
will only become liable for indemnified losses if the amount exceeds $50,000, whereupon they will be liable for all losses relating
back to the first dollar. Furthermore, the liability of Ermis Labs and LeoGroup for breaches of any and all representations and
warranties shall not exceed the purchase price payable under the Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement. The Purchaser has the ability
to set off indemnity claims against future royalty payments owed to the Ermis Labs subject to following an administrative procedure
outlined in the Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement with respect to such set off claims.  

The
closing of the Ermis Labs Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the completion
of accounting and legal due diligence investigations; the receipt of all authorizations, consents and approvals of all governmental
authorities or agencies; the receipt of any required consents of any third parties; the release of any security interests on the
Ermis Labs Target Business; delivery of all documents required for the transfer of the acquired assets, including all intellectual
property assignments. Closing of the Ermis Labs Acquisition is also subject to the prior or simultaneous closing of the PhotoMedex

The
Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights that could be exercised by the parties. Either Ermis Labs or
LeoGroup, on the one hand, or the Company or the Purchaser, on the other hand, may terminate the Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement
if the closing has not occurred by February 1, 2017 if the conditions to closing have not been satisfied by such date, except
that a party cannot terminate the Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement if the failure of the closing to occur is due to the failure of
such party to perform its covenants, agreements and conditions under the Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement. In addition, any party
may terminate the Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement if there has been a material misrepresentation or breach of covenant or agreement
contained in the Ermis Labs Purchase Agreement on the part of another party and such breach of a covenant or agreement has not

Securities
Purchase Agreement   

On
October 4, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  Securities Purchase Agreement ) with
certain accredited investors (the  Investors ), including two investors who are family members to one of our board
members, pursuant to which the Investors have agreed to purchase 8,823,530 shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.34 per
share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $3,000,000 (the  Private Placement ), of which $1,500,000 was from the related
party investors previously mentioned. The issuance of the Common Stock pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement is being
made in reliance upon an exemption from registration provided under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.  

The
proceeds of the Private Placement have been deposited into an escrow account established by the Escrow Agent under Escrow Agreement
described above under  PhotoMedex Asset Purchase Agreement.  The escrow funds will be paid to the Sellers at the PhotoMedex
Closing in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and subject to the conditions contained in the Escrow Agreement for the release
of such funds.  

The
Securities Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and the Investors. The
closing of the Private Placement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the receipt of all
authorizations, consents and approvals and delivery of customary officer certificates. Closing of the Private Placement is also
subject to the prior or simultaneous closing of the PhotoMedex Acquisition.  

Pursuant
to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company has also agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement with the Investors
in connection with the closing of the Private Placement, pursuant to which the Company will file and maintain a registration statement
with respect to the resale of the Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth therein.  

The
Securities Purchase Agreement may be terminated as follows: (i) by written agreement of the Company and the Investors holding
a majority of the shares sold under the Securities Purchase Agreement; (ii) automatically upon the termination of the PhotoMedex
Purchase Agreement; or (iii) by the Company or an Investor (as to itself but no other Investor) upon written notice to the other,
if the Closing shall not have taken place by February 1, 2017; provided, that the right to terminate under (iii) shall not be
available to any person whose failure to comply with its obligations under the Securities Purchase Agreement has been the cause
of or resulted in the failure of the closing to occur on or before such time.  

Subject
to satisfaction of the conditions described above and assuming the Securities Purchase Agreement is not terminated, the Private
Placement is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 or early first quarter of 2017. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase
Agreement, the Company may complete one or more subsequent closings on or prior to February 1, 2017 for up to maximum aggregate
gross proceeds of $7,000,000.

we disclaim any obligation, except as required by law, to provide updates, revisions or amendments to any forward-looking statements
to reflect changes in our expectations or future events.  

The
following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction
with the Financial Statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report.  

Overview   

We
develop, market and sell products through a multi-channel distribution strategy, including direct response television, or DRTV,
digital marketing campaigns, live home shopping, traditional retail and e-commerce market places, and our international third
party distributor network. We offer primarily health, beauty and wellness products as well as various consumer products, including:  

DermaWand TM ,
    a skin care device that reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and helps improve skin tone and texture;   

DermaVital   ,
    a professional quality skin care line that effects superior hydration;   

CoralActives    ,
    brand of acne treatment and skin cleansing products;   

Derma
    Brilliance   , a skin care resurfacing device that helps reduce visible signs of aging;   

Jidue TM ,
    a facial massager device which helps alleviate stress; and   

Good
    Planet Super Solution TM , a multi-use cleaning agent.   

We
acquire the rights to the products that we market primarily via licensing agreements, acquisition and in-house development and
sell both domestically and internationally. We are presently exploring other devices and consumable product lines currently under
licensing agreements.  

Fluctuations
in our revenue are driven by changes in our product mix. Revenues may vary substantially from period-to-period depending on our
product line-up. A product that generates revenue in one quarter may not necessarily generate revenues in each quarter of a fiscal
year for a variety of reasons, including, seasonal factors, number of infomercials run, the product s stage in its life-cycle,
the public s general acceptance of the marketing campaign and other outside factors, such as the general state of the economy.  

Just
as fluctuations in our revenues are driven by changes in our product mix, our gross margins from period to period depend on our
product mix. Our gross margins vary according to whether the products we are selling are primarily our own products or third-party
products. As a general rule, the gross margins for our own products are considerably higher based on proportionately smaller cost
of sales. For third-party products, our general experience is that our gross margins are lower, because we record as cost of sales
the proportionately higher cost of acquiring the product from the manufacturer. Within each category (i.e., our own products versus
third-party products), gross margins still tend to vary based on factors such as market price sensitivity and cost of production.  

Many
of our expenses for our own products are incurred up-front. Some of our up-front expenditures include infomercial production costs
which are expensed at the start of a campaign and purchases of media time. If our infomercials are successful, these up-front
expenditures produce revenue as consumers purchase the products aired on the infomercials. We do not incur infomercial production
costs and media time for our international sales to third party distributors, because we merely act as the distributor for pre-produced
infomercials. It is the responsibility of the international infomercial operators to whom we sell the third-party products to
take the pre-produced infomercial, adapt it to their local standards and pay for media time.

to the conditions contained in the Escrow Agreement for the release of such funds. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement,
we also agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement with the investors in connection with the closing of the private

Events   to our financial statements above for more information about this private placement.  

Results
of Operations   

The
following discussion compares operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 with the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
Sales  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net sales increased to approximately $4,204,000 from approximately $3,616,000 for
three months ended September 30, 2015. The primary drivers of the increase in sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 were increases of international sales by $252,000, retail and e-commerce
sales by $226,000, as well as an increase in media related expenditures which was approximately $1,444,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $1,206,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. As
a result of the increases in media spends during the three months ended September 30, 2016, sales relating to the DermaWand TM  infomercial
were approximately $2,759,000 as compared to approximately $2,658,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. However,
sales related to the DermaVital    skin care line decreased to approximately $407,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $580,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net sales decreased to approximately $12,471,000 from approximately $19,470,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary driver of the decline in sales was generated by our decrease in media
related expenditures as we continue to transition to a higher concentration of digital marketing advertising spend as compared
to infomercials. Media expenditures were approximately $4,011,000 and $6,519,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, sales relating to the DermaWand TM  infomercial
were approximately $7,662,000 as compared to approximately $14,241,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Further,
as a result of the reduced media spend, sales related to the DermaVital    skin care line were approximately $1,132,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,232,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Included
in revenue is retail sales of $293,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $58,000 of retail sales
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We expect our retail sales to grow throughout the remainder of 2016.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, international sales for the DermaWand TM  increased to approximately $865,000
from approximately $613,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and decreased to approximately $3,219,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $4,000,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our international
third party distributor revenue is impacted by timing of shipments at period end, currency fluctuations and the appreciation of
the U.S. dollar, as well as scheduling considerations with our distributors  end customers. The Latino Media Services (LMS)
group comprised of distributors from Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, El Salvador, and Ecuador accounted for approximately $247,000
and $659,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $158,000 and $874,000 in sales for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Sales to our third party distributor customer located in Mexico, Inova, were
approximately $389,000 and $892,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0 and $946,000 for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Sales from our French distributor Novellia, decreased to approximately $0 and
$876,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately $310,000 and $933,000 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company is continuing to work on a new model and marketing campaign for DermaWand TM
 as well as diversifying its international product portfolio in order to grow this segment in the future.  

Gross
Profit  

Gross
margin percentage was approximately 72% and 70% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately
67% and 68% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 we
generated approximately $3,045,000 and $8,773,000 in gross margin, compared to approximately $2,405,000 and $13,516,000 for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the gross profit
percentage for DRTV Revenue was approximately 79% and 78% compared to approximately 71% and 74% for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The gross profit percentage for international sales for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 was approximately 48% and 50% compared to approximately 45% and 48% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The increases in gross profit percentage are mainly attributable to the DermaWand TM  royalty agreement which decreased
the amount of royalties as a percentage of sales.  

Amortization
of the Dermawand  TM  intangible asset amounted to approximately $73,000 and $218,000 recorded in cost of sales for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $103,000 and $591,000 in royalty expense for DermaWand TM
 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Operating
Expenses  

Total
operating expenses increased to approximately $3,303,000 from $3,227,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. This increase in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015 is primarily driven by the increase in media and digital marking expenditures offset by decreasing in
overall operating expenditures in a number of other areas discussed below. Media expenditures were $1,444,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,206,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, digital marketing
expenses increased to approximately $299,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, from approximately $146,000 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015, as the Company evolves its marketing platform to a higher concentration on digital
marketing including search engine marketing and optimization, paid social and programmatic banner campaigns. Offsetting the increased
media and digital marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was a decrease in production costs to $7,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $85,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
decrease in operating expenses to approximately $9,713,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $14,322,000 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is due to a few key factors. This decrease in operating expenses is primarily driven
by the decrease in media expenditures. Media expenditures were $4,011,000 and $6,519,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result of the decrease in media expenses, there were additional volume related decreases.
Answering service expense decreased to approximately $531,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately
$890,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Customer service expenses decreased to approximately $261,000 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $723,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Merchant fees decreased to
approximately $210,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $398,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Total bad debt expenses decreased to approximately $694,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $1,169,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

In
addition to the volume related decreases, the Company reduced its overall operating expenditures in a number of other areas. The
Company has made a conscious effort to reduce unnecessary spending including implementing various cost savings controls. Payroll
and employee benefit related expenses decreased to approximately $367,000 and $1,132,000 during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, from approximately $407,000 and $1,289,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Travel
expenses decreased to approximately $31,000 and $77,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $46,000 and $229,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, and consulting expenses decreased to approximately
$72,000 and $202,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $81,000 and $284,000 during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, total share based compensation expenses decreased to approximately $55,000
and $259,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, from approximately $157,000 and $486,000 during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of vesting of prior awards.  

Net
Loss  

The
Company generated a net loss of approximately $(262,000) and $(951,000) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to net loss of approximately $(822,000) and $(806,000) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 can be attributed to the higher net sales discussed above, offset by the aforementioned
increase in media expenses which were offset by reductions in general and administration expenses. The net loss for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 can be attributed to the reduction in sales partially offset by the decreases in operating expenses,
as discussed above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

At
September 30, 2016, we had approximately $1,212,000 in cash and cash equivalents compared to approximately $1,334,000 at December
31, 2015. We had cash flow provided by operating activities of approximately $104,000 during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to cash flow used in operating activities of approximately $974,000 for the same period in 2015. The fluctuation
is primarily a result of a decrease in inventory of approximately $751,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of
approximately $52,000 as well as an increase in deferred revenue of approximately $82,000, offset by a net loss of approximately
$951,000, an increase in accounts receivable, net of bad debt expense, of approximately $207,000, as well as a decrease of approximately
$118,000 in accounts payable, accrued expenses and severance payable. The Company had $225,000 in cash used in financing activities
as a result of the pay-down of the DermaWand Asset Purchase Agreement.  

As
discussed in Note 5, on January 22, 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Omega 5 Technologies, Inc. to acquire
the worldwide ownership of the DermaWand patent and all related trademarks and intellectual property for the sum of $1,200,000
paid out as follows: $300,000 per year for calendar years 2016 through 2019. We believe that this agreement will provide additional
liquidity with a lower royalty cost per unit sold over the coming years.  

We had working capital of approximately $1,182,000 at
September 30, 2016, compared to $2,253,000 at December 31, 2015, which decreased partially as a result of the current portion
of the DermaWand asset purchase agreement of $300,000 being included in the calculation as of September 30, 2016 as well as the
aforementioned decrease in inventory. Based on our current rate of cash outflows and cash on hand, management believes that its
current cash will be sufficient to meet the anticipated cash needs for working capital for at least the next twelve months.  

As
discussed in Note 10, on October 4, 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with PhotoMedex to acquire substantially
all of the assets of PhotoMedex and its subsidiaries, including several of PhotoMedex s propriatary products and services
that address skin diseases and conditions or pain reduction with home-use devices. Under the terms of the agreement we are required
to pay a purchase price of $9,500,000 in the aggregate as follows: (i) $3,000,000 of the purchase price has already been
deposited into an escrow account that is governed by an escrow agreement among our company, PhotoMedex, certain investors in our
securities and the escrow agent and will be released at the closing of the PhotoMedex acquisition subject to various conditions;
(ii) $2,000,000 of the purchase price is to be paid to the PhotoMedex or its affiliates on or before the 90 th  day following
the PhotoMedex closing; and (iii) the remainder of the purchase price is payable in the form of a continuing royalty. We expect
to be able to pay the $3,000,000 and $2,000,000 cash payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, respectively, out of the
proceeds of a private placement of our common stock pursuant to a securities purchase agreement that we entered into with certain
investors on October 4, 2016 relating to the sale of up to $7 million of our common stock at a price of $0.34 per share. This
private placement is also discussed in Note 10. We have already obtained commitments from investors for the purchase of $3
million of our common stock, which funds are currently being held in escrow as described above. On October 4, 2016, we delivered
to PhotoMedex a letter of credit from the LeoGroup that secures our obligation to make the $2 million payment referred to in clause
(ii) above in the event that we do raise enough capital to cover the $2 million payment from our private placement.  

We
expect that following the closing of the PhotoMedex acquisition and the closing of the acquisition of Ermis Labs, which is also
discussed in Note 10, we will begin to generate a higher level of revenues and net income as revenues and income from the sale
of these new products are added to our current mix of products.   

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

There
have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Securities
and Exchange Commission, or SEC, defines  critical accounting policies  as those that require application of management s
most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that
are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Our significant accounting policies are described under  Critical
Accounting Policies  in our  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
included in Item 7, as well as in our consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended December 31,
2015, as filed with the Commission with our Annual Report form 10-K filed on March 23, 2016.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time frames specified in the
SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
its Chief Executive Officer, President, and its Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
based closely on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).  

Management
recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective
internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or
detect material misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods
because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.  

We
carried out an evaluation as of September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Effective
September 30, 2016, Ryan LeBon resigned as his position as Chief Financial Officer. On October 6, 2016, we entered into an employment
letter agreement with Ernest P. Kollias, Jr., who now serves as our Chief Financial Officer, at the will of our Board of
Directors, effective as of October 10, 2016.  

Off-Balance
